In 1999, the International Conference of Wycliffe Bible Translators adopted a
proposal called Vision 2025. The leaders of Wycliffe Bible Translators wanted to
revitalize our concern for the worldwide task of Bible translation. The proposal stated
our goal: to begin a Bible translation project in every language in which it is needed
by the year 2025. That is a very ambitious goal. It seems an impossible goal. Yet we
believe God would have us strive to reach this goal, for His glory. We believe that
too many language groups—approximately 2,600 of them—have waited far too long
to know of God’s redeeming grace revealed through his word.
As an organization, we have realized that to reach this goal we need to be doing
things differently. We realize that nationals of the countries in which these Bibleless
groups are located will probably do most of the actual translation work. Many of
those nationals will be translating into their own languages.
As a translation consultant, I concluded that the best thing that I could do to bring
about the fulfillment of Vision 2025 would be to prepare a new translation of the
Scriptures specifically for translators. Existing English translations were not intended
to be used as a source text by those who would be translating it into other languages.
It is our hope that A Translation for Translators will provide information that a
translator needs but which is not included in standard versions.
Its distinguishing features are:
• Short sentences
• Clear connections between clauses and sentences
• Sometimes clause order is reversed to reflect more clearly the chronological or
logical order
• All abstract nouns are made into full clauses
• Most passive constructions have an active form and a passive form supplied
• Most rhetorical questions have both a question form and a non-question form
supplied
• All figures of speech that we have been able to identify are stated non-figuratively
• Simple vocabulary is used wherever possible
2
• Words are always used in their primary sense
The implicit information that is deemed necessary to understand what the original
writer intended to convey is supplied in italics. Users can identify it easily and decide
after checking whether it is needed in that receptor language.
Most national translators who use this translation as the major source text will
need to be trained how to use it. They will need to learn to evaluate the adjustments
in this translation to determine what is the most appropriate adjustment for their
own language.
I have based this translation on the scholarship of the Semantic and Structural
Analyses and other published helps for translators, such as Exegetical Summaries, as
well as the English versions and commentaries. I do not anticipate that a translator
would use only this translation. Translators should use other translations as sources
alongside this one.
Advantages to using this translation:
• The implicit information, written in italics, is easily seen. Translators could
choose to use it, modify it, or reject it as unnecessary.
• In this day and age we have available a tremendous amount of research as to the
meaning that the original writers expected to convey to their audiences. Most of this
research and it provides the first step in translation—analyzing the meaning.
it is, or be translated, with appropriate adjustments, into other languages of
wider communication. Translation teams in Guatemala, India, Indonesia and the
Philippines have already used drafts of this translation. Efforts are already underway
to translate it into Portuguese and Spanish.
Please note that there is no implied endorsement of this translation by the
Translation Department, either of the Summer Institute of Linguistics or of the
Wycliffe Bible Translators or of any other publisher.
I offer this translation, hoping that the translators who use it will be enabled to
complete their work in a much shorter time. I also hope that by using this translation,
their work will be of a far better quality.

Affirmation
We affirm that:
• The Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments were given by inspiration of God,
and are the only infallible rule of faith and practice.
• The Scriptures were originally written in the language of the common people.
They were written with the expectation that the recipients could and would
understand the meaning clearly.
• Every person needs to have the Scriptures in the language he or she knows best.
• Every language has its own set of grammatical and lexical forms and structures
that can be used to convey meaning. But every language has forms and structures
that are different from every other language—just like every language has a set of
sounds used in it that are different from those of every other language. So we should
never expect that the forms used in one language—be it Biblical Hebrew or Greek or
any other language—will be suitable to convey a certain message, in whole and in
part, in another language.
About the author of this translation
3
Ellis W. Deibler, Jr. joined Wycliffe Bible Translators and the Summer Institute
of Linguistics in 1957. He has completed translation projects in the Alekana and
Yaweyuha languages in Papua New Guinea. Several years later he did a complete
revision of the Alekano New Testament. He has checked Bible translations, lectured
and taught on principles of translation, and led translation workshops in nineteen
countries, mostly in the south Pacific, central Asia, and south Asia. He has written
several books and published many articles dealing with Bible translation. He is now
retired and living in Waxhaw, North Carolina.
About the development team
Martha Deibler checked the translation for clearness, ambiguities, correct exegesis,
and implicit information. Martha joined Wycliffe Bible Translators in 1967 and
co-translated the New Testament in Cakchiquel in Guatemala and supervised the
translation projects in two more dialects of the same language. She has served for
more than thirty years as a Translation Consultant.
Willis Ott developed the format of the document and advised on many exegetical
and translational problems. He and his wife joined the Summer Institute of
Linguistics in 1954 and completed a translation project for the Ignaciano people
He has served as a translation consultant in Bolivia, Botswana,
Mozambique and Sudan. He retired after 44 years of service with the Summer
Andrew Sims is the project manager for this series, in charge of distribution, and
keeping records of what books, in what form, are sent to whom and when. Andrew
and his wife joined Wycliffe Bible Translators and the Summer Institute of Linguistics
in 1973. They completed a translation project in a language in the Eastern Highlands
of Irian (Indonesia) in 1996. He has served as a translation consultant in Indonesia
and Southeast Asia. He lives in Waxhaw, North Carolina.
Donna Fedukowski has helped check some of the implicit information. Gail Morse,
Linda Boehm, Martha Deibler, Joyce Gullman, Janice Roddy, Linda Jonson, Susan
Hochstetler, and several members of the Christian Reformed Church in Ann Arbor,
Michigan, have edited the copy for errors and clarity.
Note on spellings
We beg those who are accustomed to British spellings to overlook the American
way of spelling. Aside from these normal differences, please advise us of any kind
of typographical errors. We would also appreciate feedback concerning exegetical
matters.
Concerning the theme statements
In this translation, the theme statements precede each paragraph. They summarize
the thematic content of that paragraph, reflecting the most prominent ideas in that
paragraph. The translator should use the theme statements to make sure that
the reader understands the most important parts of that paragraph. For example,
a translator could rephrase the theme statement as a question to ask during a
comprehension check. If the reader/listener has clearly understood the essential focus
of the passage, he should be able to make an equivalent theme statement.
Example: A Translation for Translators has the following theme statement for Mark
2:1-12: “By healing a paralyzed man Jesus demonstrated his authority to forgive sins as
well as to heal.” Compare this theme statement with the section heading in the New
Living Translation “Jesus heals a paralyzed man” or in the Jerusalem Bible “Cure of
a paralytic”.
4
The theme statements in this translation are not the same as the section headings
that are included in most translations today.
Section headings in most translations often include more than one paragraph. They
focus on a word, person or event mentioned in the section. These usually do not
reflect the thematic focus of the section. It is my hope that the theme statements will
help translators to write clear and accurate headings in the translation. But some
may want to write theme statements similar to those in this translation instead of
short heading that most translations use.
Translators who want to include section headings should carefully consider what to
write in such headings. They should also consider where they want section headings
to occur. Although there is a theme statement for every paragraph in this translation,
a translator must choose where to include a section heading. For example, in A
Translation for Translators, the letter to Philemon has nine theme statements. A
translator may choose to have fewer section headings. If a translator includes several
paragraphs in a section, the heading he writes should reflect the themes of those
paragraphs.
A translator will also need to decide how to present the section heading. In some
English translations, section headings are not complete sentences. The translator
should present the section headings in the grammatical form that the speakers of the
language prefer.
Observe that the theme statements do not necessarily use the simplified language

In this translation, we have indicated the agent of the action wherever a passive
construction occurs. We have written in italics the words ‘by____’ to indicate the
agent, if it is implicit. Translators who choose to use a passive construction in their
translation will need to use their natural idiom and translate a reference to the agent
in those places they consider it useful.

Use of “A Translation for Translators”
WE ANTICIPATE THAT A TRANSLATION FOR TRANSLATORS WILL BE USEFUL TO
MOTHER TONGUE TRANSLATORS, AS WELL AS THOSE WHO ARE TRANSLATING IN
A LANGUAGE THAT THEY HAVE LEARNED. WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE OR CALCULATE
HOW USEFUL IT WILL PROVE TO ANY GIVEN TEAM, BUT WE ARE CERTAIN THAT IT
WILL GIVE MUCH HELP TO MANY. WE ALSO HOPE THAT IT WILL PROVE TO BE A
BLESSING TO MANY WHO ARE NOT INVOLVED IN BIBLE TRANSLATION.
Publisher’s note
Ellis W. Deibler, Jr. devoted over eight years to the creation of his own translation
of the New Testament from the latest edition of the United Bible Societies’ Greek text.
This translation was and is intended to be a tool for all translators who labor to bring
the gospel message to other languages.
However, a number of his non-translator friends who followed Ellis’ progress also
came to desire copies of their own. They came to believe that others might get
pleasure or benefit from this volume. It is also these others, then, for whom A
Translation for Translators has been brought into print and made available.
As Ellis neared completion of his master work, he began to see a new audience.
There could be many who would not need or want all of the technical details that are
to reading, even reading aloud. A companion book, A Translator’s Translation, was
A Translator’s Translation contains very much the same material found in A
(figures of speech, alternatives, etc.) required by the translator are not present. Only
the reader. Implicit material in italics is readily distinguished from the translated
text.
GENESIS 1:1
6
GENESIS 1:19
This book contains the account of God making the world
and everything there is and of his choosing the
descendants of Abraham to be his people. We call this
book
Genesis
God made the earth and the sky
1 Long, long ago God created the heavens and the earth.
2 When he began to create the earth, it was shapeless and completely desolate/
chaotic. Darkness covered the deep water that surrounded the earth. And the Spirit
of God was hovering over the water.
3 God said, “I want light to shine!” And light shone.
4 God was pleased with the light. Then he made the light to shine in some places,
and in other places there was still darkness.
5 He gave to the light the name ‘day’, and he gave to the darkness the name ‘night’.
After that, there was an evening which was followed by a morning. He called that
whole period of time ‘the first day’.
6 Then God said, “I command that there be an empty space like a huge dome to
separate the water that is above it from the water on the earth that is below it!”
7 And that is what happened. God gave to the space the name ‘sky’.
8 Then there was another evening, which was followed by another morning. He
called that period of time ‘the second day’.
9 Then God said, “I want the water that is below the sky to come together, and dry
ground to appear and rise above the water.” And that is what happened.
10 God gave to the ground the name ‘earth’, and he gave to the water that came
together the name ‘oceans’. God was pleased with the earth and the oceans.
11 Then God said, “I want the earth to produce plants, including plants that will
produce seeds and trees that will produce fruit. Each kind of tree will bear its own
kind of fruit.”
12 Then plants grew on the earth; each kind of plant began to produce its own kind
of seed.
13 Then there was another evening which was followed by another morning. God
14 Then God said, “I want a sun, a moon, and many stars to shine in the sky. The sun
the changes in their appearance they will indicate the various seasons (OR, the times
15 I want them also to be like lights in the sky that will shine on the earth.” And
16 God made two of them that were like big lights. The bigger one, the sun, shines
during the day and the smaller one, the moon, shines during the night. He also made
the stars.
17 God set all of them in the sky to shine on the earth,
18 to rule the day and the night, and to separate the light of the daytime from the
darkness of the nighttime. God was pleased with these things he had made.
19 Then there was another evening which was followed by another morning. He
called that period of time ‘the fourth day’.
GENESIS 1:20
7
GENESIS 2:7
20 Then God said, “I want many creatures to live in all the oceans, and I also want
birds to fly in the sky above the earth.”
21 So God created huge sea creatures and every other kind of creature that moves
in the water, and caused them to live in all the oceans. He also created many kinds
of birds. God was pleased with all those creatures.
22 God blessed them. He said, “Produce offspring and become very numerous. I
want the creatures in the water to live in all the oceans, and birds also to become
very numerous.” And that is what happened.
23 Then there was another evening that was followed by another morning. He
called that period of time ‘the fifth day’.
24 Then God said, “I want various kinds of creatures to appear on the earth. There
will be many kinds of ◄livestock/domestic animals►, creatures that scurry across the
ground, and large wild animals.” And that is what happened.
25 God made all kinds of wild animals and ◄livestock/domestic animals► and all
kinds of creatures that scurry across the ground. God was pleased with all these
creatures.
26 Then God said, “Now we will make human beings that will be like us in many
ways. I want them to rule over the fish in the sea, over the birds, over all the
◄livestock/domestic animals►, and over all the other creatures that scurry across
the ground.”
27 So God created human beings that were like him in many ways. He made them
to be like himself. He created some to be male and some to be female.
28 God blessed them, saying, “Produce many children, who will live all over the
earth and rule over it. I want them to rule over the fish and the birds and over all
creatures that scurry across the ground.”
29 God said to the humans, “Listen! I have given you all the plants that produce
seeds, all over the earth, and all the trees that have seeds in their fruit. All these
things are for you to eat.
30 I have given all the green plants to all the wild animals and to the birds and to
all the creatures that scurry across the ground, to everything that breathes, for them
to eat.” And that is what happened.
31 God was pleased with everything that he had made. Truly, it was all very good.
Then there was another evening, that was followed by another morning. He called
that period of time ‘the sixth day’.
2
1 That is the way God created the heavens and the earth.
2 By the time it was the seventh day, God had finished
the work of creating
everything, so he did not work any more on that day.
3 God blessed each seventh day, and he set those days apart to be special days,
because on the seventh day God did not work any more, after finishing all his work
of creating everything.
4 That is how God created the heavens and the earth.
God made the garden of Eden
God, whose name is Yahweh, made the heavens and the earth.
5 At first there were no plants growing, because Yahweh God had not yet caused
rain to fall on the ground. Furthermore, there was no one to till the ground for
planting crops.
6 Instead, mist rose up from the ground, so that it watered the surface of the ground.
7 Then Yahweh God took some soil and formed a man. He breathed into the man’s
nostrils his own breath that gives life, and as a result the man became a living person.
GENESIS 2:8

GENESIS 3:2-3
8 Yahweh God made a park/garden in a place named Eden, which was east of the
land of Canaan, and he put there the man that he had created.
9 Yahweh God also put there every kind of tree that is beautiful to see and that
produced fruit that was good to eat. He also placed in the middle of the park/garden
a tree whose fruit would enable those who ate it to live forever. He also placed there
another tree whose fruit would enable those who ate it to know what actions were
good to do and what actions were evil to do.
10 A river flowed from Eden to provide water for the park/garden. Outside of Eden,
the river divided into four rivers.
11 The name of the first river is Pishon. That river flows through all the land of
Havilah, where there is gold.
12 That gold ◄is very pure/has no impurities in it►. There is also a sweet-smelling
gum called bdellium, and valuable stones called onyx.
13 The name of the second river is Gihon. That river flows through all the land of
Cain.
of the fourth river is Euphrates.
and take care of it.
16-17 But Yahweh said to him, “You must not eat the fruit of the tree that will enable
you to know what actions are good to do and what actions are evil to do. If you eat
any fruit from that tree, on that day your relationship with me will end. But I will
permit you to eat the fruit of any of the other trees in the park/garden.”
18 Then Yahweh God said, “It is not good for this man to be alone. So I will make
someone who will be a suitable partner for him.”
19 Yahweh God had taken some soil and had formed from it all kinds of animals
and birds, and he brought them to the man to hear what names he would give them.
20 Then the man gave names to all the kinds of livestock and birds and wild animals,
but none of these creatures was a partner that was suitable for the man.
sleeping, Yahweh took out one of the man’s ribs. Then he immediately closed the
22 Yahweh then made a woman from the rib that he had taken from the man’s body,
and he brought her to the man.
23 The man exclaimed, “Wow! This is truly ◄someone like me/what I was looking
for!► She is truly from my bones and from my flesh. So I will call her woman, because
she was taken from me, a man.”
24 The first woman was taken from the man’s body, so that is why when a man and
a woman marry, they must leave their parents. The man will join very closely to his
wife, so that the two of them will be as though they are one person.
25 Although the man and his wife were naked, they were not ashamed about that.

Those first people sinned by disobeying God
1 The snake was more cunning than all the other wild animals that Yahweh God
had made. One day Satan gave to the snake the ability to talk to the woman. The snake
said to her, “Did God really say to you, ‘Do not eat the fruit from any of the trees in
the park/garden’?”
2-3 The woman replied, “What God said was, ‘Do not eat the fruit from the tree that
is in the middle of the park/garden or touch it. If you do that, you will die. But you
can eat fruit from any of the other trees.’ ”
GENESIS 3:4

GENESIS 3:21
4 The snake said to the woman, “No, you will certainly not die. God said that
5 only because he knows that when you eat fruit from that tree, you will understand
new things. It will be as though your eyes are opened [MET], and you will know what
is good to do and what is evil to do, just as God does.”
6 The woman saw that the fruit on that tree was good to eat, and it was very

footsteps of Yahweh as he was walking in the park/garden. So the man and his wife
hid themselves among the bushes in the park/garden, so that Yahweh God would not
see them.
9 But Yahweh God called to the man, saying to him, “Why are you trying to hide
from me?”
10 The man replied, “I heard the sound of your footsteps/walking in the garden, and
I was naked, so I was afraid and I hid myself.”
11 God said, “How did you find out you were naked [RHQ]? It must be because you
ate some of the fruit from the tree that I told you, ‘Do not eat its fruit.’ ” [RHQ]
12 The man said, “You gave me this woman to be with me. She is the one who gave
me some of the fruit from that tree, and so I ate it.”
13 Then Yahweh God said to the woman, “Why did you do such a thing?” The
woman replied, “I ate some of the fruit because the snake deceived me.”
14 Then Yahweh God said to the snake, “Because you did this, of all the livestock
and the wild animals, I will curse/punish you alone. As a result, you and all other
snakes will scurry across the ground on your bellies, and so what you eat will have
dirt on it as long as you live.
15 And I will cause you and the woman to act in a hostile way toward each other,
and I will cause your brood and her descendants to act hostilely toward each other.
You will strike at the heel of one descendant of hers, but he will strike your head.”
16 Then Yahweh said to the woman, “You will have great pain when you give birth
to children; you will suffer great pain as your children are being born [DOU]. You will
greatly desire your husband to show affection for you, but he will rule over you.”
17 Then Yahweh said to the man, “You heeded what your wife said, and you ate
some of the fruit of the tree concerning which I commanded you saying, ‘Do not eat
it.’ So I will make it difficult to grow things in the ground because of what you did.
You will have to work hard as long as you live to produce things from the ground to
eat.
18 Thornbushes and thistle plants and other weeds will grow and prevent what you
have planted from growing. And for food, you will have to eat things that just grow
in your fields.
19 All your life you will sweat as you work hard to produce food to eat. Then you
will die [EUP], and your body will be buried in the ground. I made you from soil, so
when you die and are buried your body will decay and become soil again.”
20 The man, whose name was Adam, named his wife Eve, which means ‘living’,
because she became the ancestor of all living people.
21 Then Yahweh God killed some animals and made clothes from their skins for
Adam and his wife.
GENESIS 3:22
10
GENESIS 4:13
22 Then Yahweh said, “Look!
Those two have become like us because they know
what is good to do and what is evil to do. So now, it will not be good if they reach
out and pick and eat some of the fruit from the tree which enables people who eat it
to live forever!”
God had created Adam from the ground, but now he forced him to till that ground
24 After Yahweh expelled them, on the east side of the garden he placed ◄cherubim/
forth. He did that in order to block the entrance to the garden, so that people could
not go back to the tree that enables people who eat its fruit to live forever.

God punished Adam and Eve’s oldest son Cain for killing his younger brother Abel
1 Adam ◄had sex/slept► with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth
to a son whom she named Cain, which sounds like the word that means ‘produce’,
because, she said, “By Yahweh’s help I have produced a son.” Some time later she
gave birth to another son, and she named him Abel.
2 After those boys grew up, Abel ◄tended/took care of► sheep and goats, and Cain
became a farmer.
3 One day Cain harvested some of the crops he had grown and brought them to
Yahweh as a gift for him,
4 and Abel took from his flock some of the first lambs that had been born and killed
them and, as a gift, gave to Yahweh the fatty parts, which were the best parts. Yahweh
was pleased with Abel and his offering,
5 but he was not pleased with Cain and his offering. So Cain became very angry,
and his face looked dejected.
6 Yahweh said to Cain, “◄You should not be angry!/Why are you angry?► [RHQ]
◄You should not scowl like that!/Why do you scowl like that?► [RHQ]
7 If you had done what was right (OR, if you do what is right) [RHQ], I would accept
your offering. But if you do not do what is right, your desire to sin is ready to attack
you like a wild animal that [PRS] crouches outside the doorway, ready to spring on
its victim [MET]. Your desire to sin wants to control you, but you must ◄control/not
obey► it.”
8 But one day, Cain said to his younger brother Abel, “Let’s go for a walk in the
fields.” So they went together. And when they were in the countryside, suddenly
Cain attacked Abel and killed him.
9 Later, even though Yahweh knew what Cain had done, he said to Cain, “Do you
know where Abel, your younger brother, is?”
Cain replied, “No, I do not know. ◄My job is not to guard my younger brother!/Am
I supposed to take care of my younger brother?►” [RHQ]
10 Yahweh said, “You have done a terrible thing [RHQ]! So now it is as though your
younger brother’s voice is crying to me from the ground, demanding that his death
must be avenged.
11 You have killed your younger brother, and the ground has soaked up his blood.
So now I will expel you from this land and curse your efforts to produce crops.
12 You will till the ground to plant crops, but the ground will produce very few
[HYP] crops. And you will continually wander around the earth, and not have any
place to live permanently.”
13 Cain replied, “You are punishing me more then I can endure.
GENESIS 4:14
11
GENESIS 5:3
14 You are about to expel me from the ground that I have been cultivating, and I will
no longer be able to come ◄into your presence/and talk with you►. Furthermore, I
and anyone who sees me will kill me.”
15 But Yahweh said to him, “No, that will not happen. I will put a mark on you to
warn anyone who sees you that I will punish him severely if he kills you. I will punish
that person seven times as severely as I am punishing you.” Then Yahweh put a mark
on Cain’s forehead.
16 So Cain left Yahweh and went to live in the land called Nod, which means
‘wandering’, which was east of Eden.
The descendants of Cain
17 Some time later, Cain ◄had sex/slept► with his wife, and she became pregnant
and gave birth to a son, whom she named Enoch. Then Cain started to build a city,
and he named the city ‘Enoch’, the same name that his son had.
18 Enoch grew up and married and became the father of a son whom he named
Irad. When Irad grew up he became the father of a son whom he named Mehujael.
Mehujael grew up and became the father of a son whom he named Methuselah.
Methuselah grew up and became the father of Lamech.
19 When Lamech grew up he married two women. The name of one was Adah and
the other was Zillah.
20 Adah gave birth to a son she named Jabal.
21 Later, Jabal was the first person who lived in tents because he traveled from place
to place to take care of livestock. His younger brother’s name was Jubal. He was the
first person who made/played a ◄lyre/stringed instrument► and a flute.
22 Lamech’s other wife Zillah gave birth to a son whom she named Tubal-Cain.
Later Tubal-Cain became a ◄blacksmith/one who made tools from bronze and iron►.
Tubal-Cain had a younger sister whose name was Naamah.
23 One day Lamech said to his two wives, “Adah and Zillah, listen carefully to what
I am saying. A young man struck me and wounded me, so I killed him.
24 Yahweh said long ago that he would avenge and punish anyone who killed Cain
seven times as much as he punished Cain for killing his younger brother. So if anyone
tries to kill me, I will punish him 77 times as much as Yahweh punished Cain.”
Adam and Eve had another son, Seth
continued to ◄have sex/ sleep► with [EUP] his wife, and she became
pregnant and gave birth to another son, whom she named Seth, which sounds like
the Hebrew word that means ‘given’, because, she said, “God has given me another
child to take the place of Abel, since Cain killed him.”
26 When Seth grew up, he became the father of a son whom he named Enosh. About
that time people began to worship Yahweh again.
25 Adam

The descendants of Adam
1 Here is a list of the descendants of Adam. When God created humans, he caused
them to be like him in many ways.
2 He created one man and one woman. He blessed them, and on the day that he
created them, he called them ‘human beings’.
just like him. That was the son he named Seth.
GENESIS 5:4
Adam lived 800 more years, and during those years he
became the father of other sons and daughters.
5 Adam lived 930 years altogether, and then he died.
6 When Seth was 105 years old, he became the father of Enosh.
7 After Enosh was born, Seth lived 807 more years, and became the father of other
sons and daughters.
8 Seth lived 912 years altogether, and then he died.
9 When Enosh was 90 years old, he became the father of Kenan.
10 After Kenan was born, Enosh lived 815 more years and became the father of
other sons and daughters.
11 Enosh lived 905 years altogether, and then he died.
12 When Kenan was 70 years old, he became the father of Mahalalel.
13 After Mahalalel was born, Kenan lived 840 more years and became the father of
other sons and daughters.
14 Kenan lived 910 years altogether, and then he died.
15 When Mahalalel was 65 years old, he became the father of Jared.
16 After Jared was born, Mahalalel lived 830 more years and became the father of
other sons and daughters.
17 Mahalalel lived 895 years altogether, and then he died.
18 When Jared was 162 years old, he became the father of Enoch.
19 Jared lived 800 years after Enoch was born, and he became the father of other
sons and daughters.
20 Jared lived 962 years altogether, and then he died.
21 When Enoch was 65 years old, he became the father of Methuselah.
22 Enoch lived in close fellowship with God for 300 years after Methuselah was
born, and he became the father of other sons and daughters.
23 Enoch lived 365 years altogether in close fellowship with God.
24 Then one day he disappeared, because God took him away to be with him in
heaven.
25 When Methuselah was 187 years old, he became the father of Lamech.
26 Methuselah lived 782 years after Lamech was born, and became the father of
other sons and daughters.
27 Methuselah lived 969 years altogether, and then he died.
28 When Lamech was 182 years old, he became the father of a son,
29 whom he named Noah, which sounds like the Hebrew word that means ‘relief’,
because he said, “He will bring us relief from all the hard work we have been doing
to produce food from the ground that Yahweh cursed.”
30 Lamech lived 595 years after Noah was born and became the father of other sons
and daughters.
31 Lamech lived 777 years altogether, and then he died.
32 When Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of a son whom he named
Shem. Later he became the father of another son whom he named Ham, and later
he became the father of another son whom he named Japheth.

People became very evil and did many evil things
1 When people began to become very numerous all over the earth,
daughters were born to them,
and many
GENESIS 6:2
13
GENESIS 6:19
2 some of the men who ◄belonged to/believed in► God saw that some of the women
who did not ◄belong to/believe in► God were very beautiful. So they took whichever
ones they chose to become their wives.
3 Then Yahweh said, “I will not allow my Spirit to keep people alive forever (OR,
the breath of life will not remain in people forever). They will die eventually. They
will live not more than 120 years before they die (OR, there will be only 120 more
years before they die).”
4 There were giants called Nephils who lived on the earth at that time and later.
During that time some of the Nephil men who ◄belonged to/believed in► God had
sex [EUP] with women who did not ◄belong to/believe in► God, and they gave birth
to children. The Nephils were considered to be heroic fighters, and they became
famous.
5 Yahweh saw that people on the earth had become very wicked, and that everything
they thought about evil things continually.
6 Yahweh was sorry that he had made people.
7 So he said, “I will completely destroy the people I made. I will also destroy all the
animals and the creatures that scurry across the ground and the birds. None of them
will remain on the earth, because I regret that I made them.”
Noah pleased God, so God planned to spare him
8 But Yahweh was pleased with Noah.
9 This is why: Noah was a man who always acted in a righteous way. No one who
lived at that time could criticize him about anything. Noah lived in close fellowship
with God.
10 Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
11 At that time God considered that everyone else on earth was very wicked, and
everywhere on the earth, people [MTY] were acting cruelly and violently toward each
other.
12 God was dismayed when he saw how evil people [MTY] were, because everyone
(OR, all living creatures) had begun to behave in an evil way.
13 So God said to Noah, “I have decided to destroy everyone, because all over the
earth people are acting violently toward each other. So I am about to get rid of them
as well as everything else on the earth.
14 I want you to make for yourself a large boat from cypress wood. Make rooms
inside it. Cover the outside and the inside with tar to make it ◄waterproof/so that
water cannot get in and sink the boat►.
15 This is the size you must make it: It shall be ◄150 yards/135 meters► long, ◄25
yards/22.5 meters► wide, and ◄15 yards/13.5 meters► high.
16 Make a roof for the boat. Leave a space of about ◄18 in./.5 meter► between the
sides and the roof to let air and light enter (OR, the middle of the roof should be 18
inches higher than the sides). Build the boat with three decks inside, and put a door
in one side.
17 Listen carefully! I am about to cause a flood to occur that will destroy every
creature that lives beneath the sky. Everything on the earth will die.
18 But I will make an agreement with you(sg): You and your wife, your sons and
19 And I want to save some of all kinds of creatures. So you must also bring two of

GENESIS 6:20
14
GENESIS 7:22
20 Two of every kind of creature will come to youin order that by your putting them
in the boat you will keep them alive. They will include two of each kind of bird and
each kind of animal and each kind of creature that scurries across the ground.
21 You must also take some of every kind of food that you and all these animals will
need, and store it in the boat.”
22 So Noah did everything that God told him to do.
7
God sent a flood to cover the earth
1 Then Yahweh said to Noah, “I have seen that out of everyone who is now living,
you alone always act righteously. So you and all your family go into the boat.
2 Take with you seven pairs of every kind of animal that I have said I will accept
for sacrifices. Take seven males and seven females. Also take a male and a female
from every kind of animal that I have said that I will not accept for sacrifices.
3 Also take seven pairs of every kind of bird from all over the earth to keep them
alive.
4 Do this because seven days from now I will cause rain to fall on the earth. It will
rain constantly for 40 days and nights. By doing that, I will destroy everything that I
have made that is on the earth.”
5 Noah did everything that Yahweh told him to do.
6 Noah was 600 years old when the flood covered the earth.
7 Before it started to rain, Noah and his wife and his sons went into the boat to
escape from the flood water.
8 Pairs of animals, those that God said that he would accept for sacrifices and those
that he would not accept for sacrifices, and pairs of birds and pairs of all the kinds
of creatures that move close to the ground,
9 males and females, came to Noah and then went into the boat, just as God told
Noah that they would do.
10 Seven days later, it started to rain and a flood began to cover the earth.
11 When Noah was 600 years old, ◄on the 17th day of the second month of that
year/late in October►, all the water that is under the surface of the earth burst forth,
and it began to rain so hard that it was as though a dam [MET] in the sky burst open.
12 Rain fell on the earth constantly for 40 days and nights.
13 On the day that it started to rain, Noah went into the boat with his wife, and his
three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth and their wives.
14 They had already put in the boat some of every kind of wild animal and every
kind of livestock and every kind of bird and every other creature that has wings.
15 Pairs of all animals came to Noah and entered the boat.
16 There was a male and a female of each animal that came to Noah, just as God
had said they would do. After they were all in the boat, God shut the door.
17 It rained for 40 days and nights, and the flood increased. It flooded until the
water lifted the boat above the ground.
19 The water rose all over the earth until it covered all the mountains.

birds and livestock and wild animals and other creatures that scurry across the
22 On the land, ◄everything that breathed/every living thing► died.
GENESIS 7:23
15
GENESIS 8:21
23 God destroyed every living creature:
People and animals and creatures that
scurry across the ground and birds. Only Noah and those who were in the boat
with him remained alive.
24 The flood remained like that on the earth for 150 days.
8
God caused the water to recede and then told Noah to leave the boat
1 But God ◄did not forget/thought► about Noah and all the wild animals and all
the kinds of livestock that were with him in the boat. So one day God sent a wind to
blow across the earth, and the wind caused the water to begin to recede.
2 God caused the water that was under the earth to stop bursting forth, and he
caused the floodgates of water from the sky to close so that it stopped raining.
3 The water on the earth gradually receded. 150 days after the flood began,
4 ◄on the 17th day of the seventh month of that year/late in March►, the boat came
to rest on one of the mountains in the Ararat region.
5 The water continued to recede until, on the first day of the tenth month of that
year, the tops of other mountains became visible.
6 40 days later, Noah opened the window that he had made in the side of the boat,
and sent out a raven.
7 The raven flew back and forth to and from the boat until the water was completely
gone.
8 Then Noah sent out a dove to find out if the water had all receded on the ground.
because there was still water all over the surface of the earth. So Noah reached out
his hand and took the dove back inside the boat.
10 Noah waited seven more days. Then he sent the dove out of the boat again.
11 This time the dove returned to him in the evening and, surprisingly, in its beak
there was a leaf from an olive tree that the dove had just plucked. Then Noah knew
that the water had truly receded from the surface of the ground.
12 Noah waited seven more days. Then he sent the dove out again, but this time it
did not return to him.
13 Noah was now 601 years old. By the first day of the first month of the Jewish
year, the water had completely drained away from the ground. Noah removed the
covering on top of the ark, and he was surprised to see that the surface of the ground
was drying.
14 By the 27th day of the next month, the ground was completely dry.
16 “Leave the boat, along with your wife and your sons and their wives.
across the ground, in order that they can spread all over the earth and become very
18 So Noah left the boat, along with his wife and his sons and their wives.
the birds, every creature that moves on the earth, left the boat. They left the boat in
groups of their own species.
God promised to never again destroy all the people with a flood
20 Then Noah built a ◄stone altar/place for offering sacrifices► to Yahweh.
Then
he took some of the animals that Yahweh had said were acceptable as sacrifices and
killed them. Then he burned them whole on the altar.
21 When Yahweh smelled the pleasant odor, he was pleased with the sacrifice. Then
he said to himself, “I will never again devastate everything on the earth because of
GENESIS 8:22
16
GENESIS 9:19
the sinful things people do. Even though everything that people think is evil from
the time they are young, I will not destroy all the living creatures again, as I did this
time.
22 As long as the earth exists, each year there will be seasons for planting seeds and
seasons for harvesting crops. Each year there will be times when it is cold and times
when it is hot, summer and winter (OR, rainy season and dry season). Each day there
will be daytime and nighttime.”
God made an agreement with Noah
9
1 Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, “I want you to have many
children who will live all over the earth.
2 All the wild animals on the earth and all the birds, all the creatures that scurry
across the ground, and all the fish, will be very afraid [DOU] of you. I have put them
under your control.
3 Just as I previously said you could eat green plants for food, now I am saying you
can eat everything that lives and moves.
4 It is blood that causes creatures to be alive, therefore you must not eat meat that
still has blood in it after the animal is killed. After you have drained the blood out,
you may cook it and eat it.
5 I insist that murderers must be executed. Animals that kill people must also be
executed. The reason that everyone who murders someone else must be executed is
that
6 I made people to be like myself in many ways. So someone who murders another
human being must be executed by others, because he killed someone who is like me.
7 As for you, I want you to produce many children, in order that they and their
descendants may live all over the earth.”
8 God also said to Noah and his sons,
9 “Listen carefully. I am now making a solemn promise to you and with your
descendants,
10 and with all the living creatures that are with you—including the birds, the
livestock, and the wild animals—every living creature on the earth that came out
of the boat with you.
11 This is the promise that I am making to you: I will never again destroy all living
creatures by a flood, or destroy everything else on the earth by a flood.”
12 Then God said to him, “This is the sign to guarantee that I will keep the promise
that I am making to you and to all living creatures, a promise that I will keep forever:
13 From time to time I will put a rainbow in the sky. It will remind me of my promise
that I have made to you and everything on the earth.
14 When I cause rain to fall from the clouds, and a rainbow appears in the sky,
15 it will remind me about the promise that I have made to you and all living
creatures, my promise that there will never again be a flood that will destroy all
living creatures.
16 Whenever there is a rainbow in the sky, I will see it, and I will think about the
promise that I have made to every living creature that is upon the earth, a promise
that I will keep forever.”
17 Then God said to Noah, “The rainbow will be the sign of the promise that I have
made to all the creatures that live on the earth.”
18 The sons of Noah who came out of the boat were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham
later became the father of Canaan.
19 All the people on the earth are descended from those three sons of Noah.
GENESIS 10:17
What happened after Noah got drunk
20 Noah was a farmer. He planted grapevines.
21 When they later produced grapes, he made wine from the grapes. One day, when
he drank too much of the wine, he became drunk, and he lay naked in his tent.
22 Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father lying naked in the tent. So he went
outside and told his two older brothers what he had seen.
23 Then Shem and Japheth took a large cloth and placed it across their backs, and
walked backwards into the tent. They covered their father’s naked body with the
cloth. Their faces were turned away from their father, so they did not see him naked.
24 When Noah woke up and was sober again, he found out how wrongfully Ham,
his youngest son, had behaved toward him.
25 He said, “I am cursing Ham’s youngest son, Canaan, and his descendants. They
will be like slaves to their uncles.
26 I will ask God to enlarge the territory that belongs to Japheth, and allow his
descendants to live peacefully among the descendants of Shem [MTY].
27 And I desire that Canaan’s descendants will be like slaves of Japheth’s
descendants.”
28 Noah lived 350 more years after the flood.
29 He died when he was 950 years old.
10
The descendants of Noah’s sons
1 ◄This is/I will now give► a list of the descendants of Noah’s sons, Shem, Ham,
and Japheth. They had many children after the flood.
2 The sons of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
3 The sons of Gomer were Askenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
4 The sons of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
5 Those sons and their families who were descended from Javan lived on the islands
and on the land close to the Mediterranean Sea. Their descendants became tribes,
each with its own language and clans and territory.
6 The descendants of Ham were Cush, Egypt, Put, and Canaan.
7 The descendants of Cush were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The
descendants of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan.
8 Another one of Cush’s descendants was Nimrod. Nimrod was the first person on
earth who became a mighty warrior.
9 Yahweh saw that he had become (OR, caused him to become) a great hunter. That
is why people say to a great hunter, “Yahweh ◄sees that you are/has caused you to
be► a great hunter like Nimrod.”
10 Nimrod became a king who ruled in Babylonia. The first cities over which he
ruled were Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh.
11 From there he went with others to Assyria and built the cities of Nineveh,
Rehoboth-Ir, Calah,
12 and Resen. Resen was a large city between Nineveh and Calah.

and Heth, his younger son.
16 Canaan was also the ancestor of the Jebus, Amor, Girgash,
17 Hiv, Ark, Sin,

GENESIS 11:8
18 Arved,
Zemar and Hamath people-groups. Later the descendants of Canaan
dispersed over a large area.
19 Their land extended from Sidon city in the north as far south as Gaza town, and
then to the east as far as Gerar town, and then farther east to Sodom, Gomorrah,
Admah, and Zeboiim towns, and even as far as Lasha town.
20 Those are the descendants of Ham. They became groups that had their own clans,
their own languages, and their own land.
21 Shem, the older brother of Japheth, became the father of Eber, and the ancestor
of all the descendants of Eber.
22 The sons of Shem were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.
23 The sons of Aram were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
24 Arphaxad became the father of Shelah. Shelah became the father of Eber.
25 Eber became the father of two sons. One of them was named Peleg, which means
‘division’, because during the time he lived, people on [MTY] the earth became divided
and scattered everywhere. Peleg’s younger brother was Joktan.
26 Joktan became the ancestor of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
27 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
28 Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
29 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All those people were descended from Joktan.
30 The areas in which they lived extended from Mesha westward to Sephar, which
is in the ◄hill country/area that has a lot of hills►.
31 They are descendants of Shem. They became groups that had their own clans,
their own languages, and their own land.
32 All those groups descended from the sons of Noah. Each group had its own
◄genealogy/record of people’s ancestors► and each became a separate ethnic group.
Those ethnic groups formed after the flood and spread all around the earth.
11
Yahweh caused people to speak many different languages after they started to build
a tower at Babel
1 At first, all the people in [MTY] the world spoke the same language [DOU].
2 As people moved further east, they arrived at a plain in Babylonia region and
began to live there.
3 Then they said to each other, “◄Hey/Come on►, let’s form bricks and bake them
instead of ◄mortar/a mixture of cement, sand and lime► to hold them together.
tower that reaches up to the sky! In that way we will become famous! If we do not
5 So they began to build the city and the tower. Then Yahweh looked down and saw
the city and the tower that those puny men were building.
6 Yahweh said, “These people are one group that all speak the same language. If
they have begun to do this now, then ◄there is nothing that they will decide to do
that will be impossible for them/they will be able to do whatever they decide to do►
[LIT]!
7 So, okay/ now, we will go down there and cause there to be many different
languages, so that they will not be able to understand each other.”
8 So Yahweh did that. As a result, the people stopped building the city, and Yahweh
caused them to disperse all over the earth.
GENESIS 11:9
19
GENESIS 11:32
9 The city was called Babel which means ‘confusion’, because there Yahweh caused
the people to become confused because the people [MTY] spoke different languages
that the others could not understand, not just one language. From there Yahweh
caused them to disperse all over the earth.
Shem’s descendants
10 ◄This is a bigger list/I will now tell you more► of the descendants of Shem:
Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father of
Arpachshad.
11 After Arpachshad was born, Shem lived 500 more years and had more sons and
daughters.
12 When Arphachshad was 35 years old, he became the father of Shelah.
13 After Shelah was born, Arpachshad lived 403 more years and became the father
of more sons and daughters.
14 When Shelah was 30 years old, he became the father of Eber.
15 After Eber was born, Shelah lived 403 more years and became the father of other
sons and daughters.
16 When Eber was 34 years old, he became the father of Peleg.
17 After Peleg was born, Eber lived 430 more years and became the father of other
sons and daughters.
18 When Peleg was 30 years old, he became the father of Reu.
19 After Reu was born, Peleg lived 209 more years and became the father of other
sons and daughters.
20 When Reu was 32 years old, he became the father of Serug.
21 After Serug was born, Reu lived 207 more years and became the father of other
sons and daughters.
22 When Serug was 30 years old, he became the father of Nahor.
23 After Nahor was born, Serug lived 200 more years and became the father of other
sons and daughters.
24 When Nahor was 29 years old, he became the father of Terah.
25 After Terah was born, Nahor lived 119 more years and became the father of other
sons and daughters.
26 When Terah was 70 years old, his son Abram was born. Later, two other sons,
Terah’s descendants
27 ◄This is/I will now give► a list of the descendants of Terah: Terah’s sons were
Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran’s son was named Lot.
28 Haran died before his father died. He died in Ur city in Chaldea land, where he
was born.
29 Abram and Nahor both married. Abram’s wife was named Sarai, and Nahor’s
wife was named Milcah. Milcah and her younger sister Iscah were the daughters of
Haran.
30 Sarai was unable to bear any children.
31 Terah decided to leave Ur and go to live in Canaan land. So he took his son
Abram and his grandson Lot, the son of Haran, and Abram’s wife Sarai with him.
But instead of going to Canaan, they stopped at Haran town and lived there.
32 When Terah was 205 years old, he died there in Haran.
12
Yahweh told Abram to go to Canaan and promised to bless him
GENESIS 12:1
20
GENESIS 12:20
1 Then Yahweh said to Abram, “Leave this country where you are now living. Leave
your father’s clan and his family. Go to a land that I will show you.
2 I will cause your descendants to become a large nation. I will bless you and cause
you to become ◄famous/highly esteemed►. What I do for you will be a blessing to
others.
3 I will bless those who ◄bless/ask God to do good things for► you, and I will ◄curse/
ask God to punish► those who do evil things to you. And because of what you do,
groups of people all over the earth will receive blessings (OR, people will wish that
God will bless others as much as he has blessed you).”
4 So Abram left Haran town, as Yahweh told him to do. Abram was 75 years old
when he left there along with his wife, Sarai, and his nephew, Lot.
5 Abram also took along all the possessions and slaves that they had accumulated/
acquired in Haran town, and they left there and went to Canaan land.
6 In Canaan they traveled as far as Shechem town and camped by a huge tree called
the tree of Moreh. The Canaan people-group were still living in that land.
7 Then Yahweh appeared to Abram and said to him, “I will give this land to your
descendants.” Then Abram built a stone altar to offer a sacrifice to Yahweh because
Yahweh had appeared to him.
8 From Shechem, Abram and his family traveled to the hills that were east of Bethel
town. Bethel town was to the west of where they set up their tent, and Ai town was
further to the east. There he built another stone altar and offered a sacrifice and
worshiped Yahweh there.
9 Then they left there and started traveling south to the Negev Desert.
Abram and Sarai went to Egypt for a while
11 Just as they were about to enter Egypt, Abram said to his wife Sarai, “Listen, I
know that you are a very beautiful woman.
12 When the people in Egypt see you, they will say, ‘This woman is his wife!’ and
they will kill me in order to get you, but they will not kill you.
13 So I ask you to tell them that you are my sister, so that because of you telling
them that, they will ◄spare my life/not kill me►.”
14 And as soon as they arrived in Egypt, the people in Egypt saw that his wife was
indeed very beautiful.
15 When the king’s officials saw her, they told the king how beautiful she was. And
they took her to the king’s palace.
16 The king treated Abram kindly because of Sarai, and he gave Abram many sheep
and cattle and donkeys and male and female slaves and camels.
17 But because the king had taken Sarai, Abram’s wife, Yahweh caused the king and
the others in his household to be inflicted with terrible diseases.
18 When the king realized why that was happening, he summoned Abram and said
to him, “Why did you do this to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?
19 Why did you lie, saying she is your sister, with the result that I took her to be my
wife? You should not have done that! So now take your wife, leave here and go!”
20 Then the king told his officials/servants to take Abram and his wife and all his
possessions out of Egypt.
13
Abram and Lot separated
GENESIS 13:1
21
GENESIS 14:2
1 So Abram and Sarai left Egypt, and they took along all his possessions, and Lot
went with them to the Negev Desert.
2 Abram was very rich. He owned a lot of livestock, silver and gold.
3 They continued traveling from place to place from the Negev Desert toward Bethel
town to the place between Bethel and Ai where they had previously set up their tents,
4 and where Abram had made a stone altar and worshiped Yahweh.
5 Lot, who was traveling with Abram, also had flocks of sheep and goats and herds
of cattle, and tents.
6 But they had so many animals that they could not all stay in the same area. There
was not enough land to provide water and food for all their animals.
7 Furthermore, the descendants of Canaan and Perizzi were also living in that area,
and the land really belonged to them. And the men who took care of Abram’s animals
started quarreling with the men who took care of Lot’s animals.
8 So Abram said to Lot, “Since we are close relatives, it is not good for us two to
quarrel, or for the men who take care of your animals to quarrel with the men who
take care of my animals.
9 There is plenty of land for both of us. So we should separate. You can choose
whatever part you want [RHQ]. If you want the area over there, I will stay here. If
you want the area here, I will go over there.”
10 Lot looked around toward Zoar town, and saw that there was plenty of water all
land in Egypt. [That was before Yahweh destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
11 So Lot chose the land in the plain of the Jordan River. He left his uncle, Abram,
12 Abram stayed in the Canaan area, and Lot started to live near the cities in the
plain of the Jordan River, and he set up his tents near Sodom city.
13 You need to know that people who lived there were extremely wicked.
Abram moved to Hebron
14 After Abram and Lot separated, Yahweh said to Abram, “Look around at this
whole area where you are. Look north and south, look east and west.
15 I will give to you and your descendants all the land that you see; I will give it to
you forever.
16 I will cause your descendants to be as numerous as particles of dust! It will be
easier to count the particles of dust than it will be to count your descendants [HYP].
17 Walk through the land in every direction, because I am going to give it all to
you.”
18 So Abram and his men took down their tents and moved to Hebron and started
to live by the huge trees at the town of Mamre. He placed a stone altar there to make
sacrifices to Yahweh.
14
1 In a region to the east, there were four kings who were friends/allies. They were
King Amraphel of Babylonia, King Arioch of Ellasar, King Chedorlaomer of Elam, and
2 In an area to the west, there were five other kings. They were King Bera of Sodom,
King Birsha of Gomorrah, King Shinab of Admah, King Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the
king of Bela, the city that is now called Zoar.
GENESIS 14:3
22
GENESIS 14:19
3 Those five kings and their armies gathered together in Siddim Valley, which is
also called the Dead Sea Valley, to fight against the four kings and their armies. King
Chedorlaomer and his army conquered the armies of those five kings, and demanded
that those kings pay him tribute money each year.
4 For twelve years he ruled them. But during the thirteenth year they rebelled and
refused to keep giving him tribute money.
5 The next year, King Chedorlaomer and the other kings that were his allies took
their armies and defeated the Repha people-group in Ashteroth-Karnaim and the Zuz
people-group in Ham, and the Emi people-group in Shaveh-Kiriathaim.
6 They also defeated the Hor people-group in the hilly area of Seir as far as El-Paran
near the desert.
7 Then they turned back and went to Mishpat city, which is now called Kadesh.
They conquered all the land belonging to the Amalek people-group and the Amor
people-group who were living in Hazazon-Tamar town.

and Gomorrah tried to run away, many of the men fell into the tar pits. The others
escaped and ran away to the hills.
11 As the armies of the five kings fled, the armies of the four kings seized all of the
valuable things in Sodom and Gomorrah, including all the food.
12 They also captured Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions, since he was living
in Sodom at that time.
13 Abram was living near the big trees near Mamre, who belonged to the Amor
people-group. Abram had made an agreement with Mamre and his two brothers,
Eshcol and Aner, that they would help each other if there was a war.
14 One of the men who escaped from the battle told Abram what had happened and
that his nephew Lot had been captured and taken away. So Abram summoned 318
men who were his servants, men who had been with Abram since they were born.
They all went together and pursued their enemies as far north as Dan city.
15 During the night, Abram divided the men into several groups, and they attacked
their enemies from various directions and defeated them. They pursued them as far
as Hobah, which was north of Damascus city.
16 Abram’s men recovered all of the goods that had been taken. They also rescued
Lot and all his possessions and also the women and others who had been captured
by their enemies.
Melchizedek blessed Abram
17 As Abram was returning home after he and his men had defeated the armies of
King Chedorlaomer and the other kings who had fought alongside him, the king of
Sodom went north to meet him in Shaveh Valley, which people call the King’s Valley.
18 The king of Salem city, whose name was Melchizedek, was also a priest who
offered sacrifices to the Supreme God. He brought some bread and wine to Abram.
19 Then he blessed Abram, saying “I ask the Supreme God, the one who created
heaven and earth, to bless you.
GENESIS 14:20
23
GENESIS 15:14
20 The Supreme God has enabled you to defeat [MTY] your enemies, so we should
praise/thank him.” Then Abram gave to Melchizedek a tenth part of all the things he
had captured.
21 The king of Sodom said to Abram, “You can keep all the goods you recovered.
Just let me take back the people from my city whom you rescued.”
22 But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have solemnly promised [MTY] to
Yahweh, the Supreme God, the one who created heaven and earth,
23 that I will not accept even one thread or a thong of a sandal from anything that
belongs to you. As a result, you will never be able to say, ‘I caused Abram to become
rich.’
24 The only thing I will accept is the food that my men have eaten. But Aner, Eshcol,
and Mamre went with me and fought alongside me, so let them also have a share of
Yahweh made a solemn promise to Abram
1 Some time later, Abram had a vision in which Yahweh spoke to him and said, “Do
not be afraid of ◄anything/your enemies►. I will protect you [MTY], and I will give a
great reward.”
2 But Abram replied, “Yahweh God, how can you give me what I truly want, because
I have no children, and the one who will be like a son and inherit all my possessions
is my servant Eliezer from Damascus!”
3 Abram added, “You have not given me any children, so think about this: A servant
in my household will inherit all I own!”
4 Yahweh replied, “No! He will not be the one who will inherit it. Instead, you
yourself will be the father of the one who will inherit everything you own.”
5 Then Yahweh took Abram outside of his tent and said, “Look up at the sky! Can
you count the stars? No, you cannot count them because there are so many of them,
and your descendants will be as numerous as the stars.”
6 Abram believed that what Yahweh said would happen. And because of that,
Yahweh considered that Abram was righteous.
7 Yahweh also said to him, “I am Yahweh. I am the one who brought you from Ur
in Chaldea land. I brought you here to give you this land to possess.”
8 But Abram replied, “Yahweh God, how can I know for sure that this land will
belong to me?”
9 God said to him, “Bring a three-year-old heifer and a three-year-old goat to me,
and a dove and a pigeon.”
10 So Abram brought all of them and killed them and cut each of the animals in
half. He arranged the halves of each one, side by side. But he did not cut the pigeon
and dove in half.
11 Birds that eat dead flesh came down to eat the carcasses, but Abram shooed them
away.
12 As the sun was going down, Abram fell sound asleep, and suddenly everything
around him became dark and frightening.
13 Then God said to Abram, “I want you to know that your descendants will become
foreigners living in a land that does not belong to them. They will become slaves of
the owners of that land. The owners of the land will mistreat them for 400 years.
14 But then I will punish the people of that country that made them become slaves,
and then your descendants will leave that country, taking many possessions with
them.
GENESIS 15:15
24
GENESIS 16:13
15 But as for you, you will die [EUP] peacefully when you are very old.
16 After your descendants have been slaves for 400 years, they will return here,
and take control of this land and defeat the Amor people-group. Those people will,
because those people have not yet sinned enough to deserve to be punished now.”
17 When the sun had set and it had become dark, unexpectedly a blazing torch and
a clay pot containing burning coals from which smoke was rising appeared and went
between the halves of the animals.

19 That is the land where the Ken, the Keniz, the Kidmon,
20 the Heth, the Periz, the Repha,
21 the Amor, the Canaan, the Girgash, and the Tebus people-groups live.”
16
Sarai gave Abram a slave woman to be another wife, and that woman gave birth to
Ishmael
1 Up to that time, Abram’s wife Sarai had not given birth to any children for Abram.
But she had a female slave from Egypt, whose name was Hagar.
2 So one day Sarai said to Abram, “Listen to me! Yahweh has not allowed me to
become pregnant. So ◄sleep with/have sex with► [EUP] my slave Hagar. Perhaps she
will bear children whom I can consider to be mine.” Abram agreed to do what Sarai
said.
3 So Abram ◄slept with/had sex with► Hagar, his wife Sarai’s slave from Egypt. This
happened ten years after they went to live in Canaan land. Sarai gave Hagar to her
husband to be his secondary wife.
4 He ◄slept with/had sex with► [EUP] Hagar and she became pregnant. When she
realized that she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress Sarai.
5 Then Sarai said to Abram, “It is your fault! I put my servant into your arms, so
that you could sleep with her [EUP]. Now she realizes that she is pregnant, and she
despises me. I think Yahweh will punish you for doing this to me!”
6 So Abram said to Sarai, “You listen to me! She is your servant, so act towards her
in the way you consider best.” Then Sarai started to mistreat her, so she ran away
from Sarai.
7 An angel of Yahweh found her as she was near a spring of water in the desert. It
was the spring that was alongside the road to Shur.
8 He said to her, “Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are
you going?” She replied, “I have run away from Sarai, my mistress.”
9 The angel said, “Go back to your mistress and be under her authority [MTY]”.
10 The angel also said to her, “I will enable you to bear so many descendants that
no one will be able to count them!”
11 The angel also said to her, “Listen to this! You are pregnant. You will give birth
to a son. You must name him Ishmael, which means ‘God hears’, because Yahweh has
heard you crying because you feel so miserable.
12 But your son will be as uncontrollable as a wild donkey [MET]. He will oppose
everyone, and everyone will oppose him [MTY]. He will live far away from his
relatives [SYN].”
13 Then Hagar realized that the angel was really Yahweh, so she said to herself, “◄It
is difficult to believe that I have really seen the back of Yahweh, the one who sees
me!/Have I really seen the back of Yahweh, the one who sees me?►” [RHQ] So she
called him ‘Yahweh, the one who sees me’.
GENESIS 16:14
25
GENESIS 17:15
14 That is why people call the well there ‘Beer-Lahai-Roi’, which means, ‘The well of
15 So Hagar later gave birth to a son for Abram, and she gave to her son the name
16 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar gave birth to Abram’s son Ishmael.
17
Yahweh changed Abram’s name to Abraham and made an agreement with him
1 When Abram was 99 years old, Yahweh appeared to him again and said to him,
“I am God Almighty. I want you to live in a way that I will regard you as someone
that cannot be criticized.
2 If you do that, I will make an agreement with you in which I will promise to
enable you to have very many descendants.” [MTY]
3 Abram prostrated himself with his face on the ground. Then God said to him,
4 “Listen to this agreement that I am making with you: People of many nations will
be your descendants.
5 And no longer will your name be Abram. Instead, your name will be Abraham,
which means ‘father of many nations,’ because the people of many nations will
descend from you.
6 I will enable you to have very many descendants, and I will cause them to become
great nations/people-groups, and some of your descendants will become kings.
7 I will make this agreement between me and you and your descendants. It will
be an everlasting agreement to be in effect for many generations. This agreement is
that I will be your God, and the God of your descendants.
8 I will give to you and to your descendants the land through which you are now
traveling, all of the Canaan region. It will be an everlasting possession for your
descendants, and I will be the God that they will worship.”
God told Abraham that all the males must be circumcised as part of that agreement
9 Then God said to Abraham, “Now you must obey your part of the agreement that
I am making with you, and your descendants must also obey it, for all generations.
10 This is the agreement that I am making, between myself and you and all your
descendants: Every male among you must be circumcised.
11 ◄Cutting the foreskins of/Circumcising► them will be the sign that you have
accepted the agreement I am making with you.
12 Every male child among you must be circumcised when he is eight days old, in
all future generations. That includes baby boys in your household or those born from
slaves that have been bought, and baby boys of foreigners who live among you but
do not belong to your household.
13 It does not matter whether their parents are members of your household or
slaves that have been bought; they must all be circumcised. Your bodies will have
this mark to show you have accepted this everlasting agreement I am making.
14 You must expel from your community any male who has not been circumcised,
because by not being circumcised that person has disobeyed my agreement.”
God changed Sarai’s name to Sarah
15 God also said to Abraham, “As for Sarai, your wife, you must not call her Sarai
any longer. Since I changed your name, I will change her name also. Her name will
now be Sarah.
GENESIS 17:16
26
GENESIS 18:8
16 I will bless her, and she will surely give birth to a son for you.
And I will bless
her so much that she will be the ancestor of people of many nations. Kings of some
people-groups will be descended from her.”
God promised Abraham and Sarah that they would have a son
17 Abraham prostrated himself with his face on the ground to show respect to God.
But then he laughed as he said to himself, “Can a man who is a 100 years old become
a father of a son? And since Sarah is 90 years old, how can she bear a child?”
18 Then Abraham said to God, “Perhaps you will let Ishmael receive your blessing
and inherit all I possess.”
19 Then God replied, “No! Your wife Sarah will bear a son for you. You must name
him Isaac. I will establish my agreement with him, one which will be an everlasting
agreement for him and his descendants.
20 As for Ishmael, I have heard what you asked me to do for him. I will bless him
so that he also will have many descendants. Among his descendants will be rulers of
twelve nations. And I will cause his descendants [MTY] to also become a great nation.
21 But Isaac, the son whom Sarah will give birth to at this time next year, is the one
with whom I will establish my agreement.”
22 When God finished talking to Abraham, God disappeared from his sight.
23 On that same day, Abraham took his son Ishmael and all the males that were in
his household, including the sons of all the slaves he had bought, and circumcised
them. He cut off their foreskins, just as God told him to do.
24 Abraham was 99 years old when ◄he was circumcised/someone circumcised
him►,
25 and Ishmael was thirteen years old when Abraham circumcised him.
26 On that very day Abraham and his son, Ishmael were circumcised.
27 And all the males in his household, the ones who had been born there and those
who had been bought from foreigners, were also circumcised.
18
Yahweh appeared to them and promised again that they would have a son
near the big trees that belonged to Mamre, while Abraham was sitting in the entrance
to his tent.
2 Abraham looked up [MTY] and was surprised to see three men standing near him.
Actually, one was Yahweh, and the other two were angels. When he saw them, he ran
to meet them. He prostrated himself with his face on the ground to show respect,
3 and said to one of them, “Sir, if you are pleased with me, stay here for a little while
[LIT].
4 Allow my servants to bring a little water and wash your feet, and rest under this
tree.
5 Since you have come here to me, allow me to bring you some food [SYN] so that
you can feel refreshed before you leave.” Yahweh replied, “All right, do as you have
said.”
6 So Abraham quickly went into the tent and said to Sarah, “Quick, get some of our
best flour and make some loaves of bread!”
and tasty. He gave it to one of his servants and told him to quickly kill it and cook it.
that had been prepared, and set them in front of his visitors. Then he stood near
them, under a tree, while they ate.

GENESIS 18:28
9 One of them asked him, “Where is Sarah, your wife?”
He replied, “She is in the
tent.”
10 Then the leader of the group said, “I will return to you ◄about this time/in the
springtime► next year, and to your amazement, your wife Sarah will have an infant
son.” It happened that Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent, which was
behind the one who was speaking.
11 Abraham and Sarah were very old, and Sarah was far past the time of when she
could bear children.
12 So Sarah laughed to herself, thinking, “My body is worn out, and my husband is
old. So how can I have the pleasure of having a child?” [RHQ]
13 Yahweh said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh? Why was she thinking, ‘I am
too old, so how can I bear a child?’
14 I am Yahweh! ◄Is there anything too difficult for me?/There is nothing too
difficult for me!► [RHQ] I will return about this time next year in the springtime,
and Sarah will have an infant son.”
15 Then Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, “I did not laugh.” But Yahweh said,
“Don’t deny it! You did laugh.”
Abraham tried to intercede for the wicked people of Sodom
16 When the three men got up to leave, they looked down into the valley toward
Sodom city. Abraham was walking with them to say “goodbye” to them.
17 Yahweh thought to himself, “It is not right for me to prevent Abraham from
knowing what I plan to do [RHQ].
18 Abraham’s descendants [MTY] will become a great and powerful nation. And
people of [MTY] all nations will be blessed because of what I do for him.
19 I have chosen him in order that he will teach his children and their families
to obey me and do what is right and fair, and then I will do for Abraham what I
promised.”
20 So Yahweh said to Abraham, “I have heard the terrible things that have been
said about the people of [MTY] Sodom and Gomorrah. Their sins are very great.
21 So I will go down now, and I will see if all the terrible things that I have heard
are true or not true.”
22 Then the two men turned and started walking toward Sodom. But Yahweh
remained, standing in front of Abraham.
23 Abraham came closer to him and said, “Will you really destroy righteous people
along with wicked ones?
24 What will you do if there are only 50 righteous people in the city? Will you really
get rid of them all, and not spare the place/city for the sake of the 50 righteous people
who are in the city?
along with wicked ones, and treat righteous people and wicked people the same way.
certainly do what is right regarding the people of Sodom!” [RHQ]
place/city for their sake.”
I am as worthless as dust and ashes [MET].
28 But what will you do if there are only 45 righteous people? Will you destroy
everyone in the whole city because there are only 45 and not 50 righteous people?”
Yahweh replied, “I will not destroy it if I find that there are 45 righteous people.”
GENESIS 18:29
28
GENESIS 19:12
29 Abraham continued to speak to him like this, saying, “What will you do if you find
that there are only 40 righteous people there?” Yahweh replied, “I will not destroy
them all, for the sake of the 40.”
30 Abraham said, “God, please don’t be angry now. Let me speak again. What will
you do if there are only 30 righteous people?” He replied, “I will not do it if I find
that there are 30 there.”
31 Abraham said, “I should not be bold and speak to you like this, God. But what
will you do if you find that there are only 20 righteous people there?” He replied, “I
will not destroy the whole city, for the sake of those 20.”
32 Abraham said, “God, don’t be angry now. Just let me speak one time more. What
will you do if you find that there are only ten righteous people there?” Yahweh
answered, “I will not destroy the city for the sake of those ten.”
33 Abraham said no more, and as soon as Yahweh finished speaking with Abraham,
he left, and Abraham returned home.

Angels warned Lot that Sodom would be destroyed because of the people’s
wickedness
1 That evening, the two angels arrived in Sodom. Lot was sitting at the gateway of
the city. When he saw them, he got up to greet them, and prostrated himself with his
face on the ground.
2 He said to them, “Gentlemen, please stay in my house tonight. You can wash your
feet, and tomorrow you can continue your journey.” But they said, “No, we will just
sleep in the city square.”
3 But Lot kept insisting strongly that they sleep in his house. So they entered his
house with him, and he prepared a meal for them. He baked some bread without
yeast, and they ate it.
4 After they finished eating, before they went to bed, the men of Sodom city, all of
them, from the young ones to the old ones, surrounded the house.
5 They called out to Lot, saying, “Where are the men who came to your house this
evening? Bring them out, so that we can have sex with them!” [EUP]
6 Lot went outside the house and shut the door behind him, so that they could not
go inside.
7 He said to them, “My friends, don’t do such an evil thing!
8 Listen to me. I have two daughters who have never had sex with any man. Let
But don’t do anything to these men, because they are guests in my house, so I must
9 But they replied, “Get out of our way! You are a foreigner; so you have no right
you than we will do to them!” Then they lunged towards Lot, and tried forcefully to
break down the door.
10 But the two angels opened the door carefully, reached out their hands, and pulled
Lot to them inside the house. Then they quickly shut the door.
11 Then they caused all the men who were outside the door of the house, young
and old, to become blind, so that they could not find the door.
12 Then the two angels said to Lot, “Who else is with you here? If you have sons or
out of the city,
GENESIS 19:13
29
GENESIS 19:32
13 because we are the ones who are going to destroy this place. Yahweh considers
that these people are so evil that he sent us to destroy the city.”
14 So Lot went and spoke to the men who had pledged to marry his daughters. He
said to them, “Hurry! Get out of this city, because Yahweh is about to destroy it!” But
his future sons-in-law thought he was joking.
15 As it was about to dawn the next morning, the two angels urged Lot, saying, “Get
up quickly! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here with you and leave!
If you don’t, you will die when we destroy/Yahweh destroys the city!”
16 When Lot hesitated, the angels grasped his hand and his wife’s hand and the
hands of his two daughters. They led them outside the city safely. The angels did that
because Yahweh was acting mercifully toward them.
17 When they were outside the city, one of the angels said, “If you want to remain
alive, run away quickly! Don’t look back! And don’t stop anywhere in the valley!
Flee to the hills! If you don’t, you will die!”
18 But Lot said to one of the angels, “No, sir, don’t make me do that!
19 Please, listen. You have been pleased with me and have been very kind to me
and spared my life. But I cannot flee to the mountain. If I try to do that, I will die in
this disaster [PRS].
20 But listen to me. There is a town nearby. Let me run to that small town. Let me
go there now. It is a small town, but our lives will be saved if we go there.”
21 One of the angels said to Lot, “I will allow you to do what you have requested
[MTY]. I will not destroy the little town you are speaking about.
22 But hurry! Run there, because I cannot destroy anything until you arrive there.”
People later called the name of the town Zoar which means ‘small’, because Lot said
it was small.
God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah cities
23 As the sun was rising, Lot and his family arrived in the town which is now called
Zoar.
24 Then Yahweh caused fire and burning sulfur to fall down on Sodom and
Gomorrah like rain.
25 In that way, he destroyed those cities and all the people who were living in those
26 But Lot’s wife stopped and looked back to see what was happening, so she died,
27 That morning, Abraham got up and went to the place where he had stood in front
of Yahweh.
28 He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and he was surprised to see that
all over the valley, smoke was rising, like the smoke of a huge furnace.
29 So, when God destroyed those cities in the valley, he remembered what he had
promised Abraham, and he rescued Lot from the disaster that occurred in the cities
where Lot had lived.
Lot’s daughters tricked him into making them pregnant
30 Lot was afraid to stay in Zoar, so he left there and moved with his two daughters
to the mountain, and they lived in a cave.
31 One day the older daughter said to ◄the younger daughter/her sister►, “Our
father is old, and there is no man in this area who can have sex [EUP] with us, as
people all over the earth do.
32 Let’s make our father drink wine until he gets drunk. Then we can have sex with
him [EUP] without him knowing it. In that way he will cause us to become pregnant
and we can bear children.”
GENESIS 19:33
30
GENESIS 20:11
33 So that night they caused their father to become drunk. And the older daughter
went in and lay in bed with her father, and he had sex with her, but he was so drunk
that he did not know when she lay down with him or when she got up.
34 The next day, his older daughter said to ◄his younger daughter/her sister►,
again tonight! This time you can go and sleep with him. If he has sex with you, you
35 So that night, they caused their father to become drunk with wine again, and
then his younger daughter went and slept with him. But again, he was so drunk that
he did not know when she lay down with him or when she got up.
36 So Lot caused his two daughters to become pregnant.
37 The older one later gave birth to a son, whom she named Moab. He became the
ancestor of the Moab people-group.
38 The younger one also gave birth to a son, whom she named Ben-Ammi. He
became the ancestor of the Ammon people-group.
20
Abraham deceived King Abimelech about Sarah
1 Abraham left Mamre and moved southwest to the Negev desert and lived in a
place named Gerar, between Kadesh and Shur.
2 While he was there, he told people that Sarah was his sister, not his wife. Then
King Abimelech of Gerar sent some of his men to Sarah, and they brought her to him
to be his wife.
3 But God appeared to Abimelech in a dream during the night and said to him,
“Listen to me! You are going to die because the woman you took is another man’s
wife.”
4 But Abimelech had not had sex [EUP] with her, so he said, “God, since the people
of my nation and I am innocent; will you kill me?
5 He told me, ‘She is my sister,’ and she also said, ‘He is my brother.’ I did this with
pure motives and I [SYN] have not done anything wrong yet.”
6 God said to him in another dream, “Yes, I know that your motives were pure. That
is why I truly prevented you from sinning against me. I did not allow you to have
sex [EUP] with her.
7 Now, return this man’s wife to her husband, because he is ◄a prophet/a man who
receives messages from me►. He will pray for you, and you will ◄remain alive/not
die►. But if you do not return her to him, you will certainly die, and all the members
of your household will also certainly die.”
8 Early the next morning, Abimelech summoned all his officials, and told them
everything that had happened. When they heard that [MTY], his men were very
afraid that God would punish them.
9 Abimelech then summoned Abraham, and said to him, “You should not have done
that to us [RHQ]! Did I do something wrong to you, with the result that you are causing
me and the people in [MTY] my kingdom to be guilty of committing a great sin [RHQ]?
You have done things to me that ◄should not be done/you should not have done►!”
10 Abimelech asked Abraham, “What was your reason for doing this?”
11 Abraham replied, “I said that because I thought, ‘They certainly do not respect
God in this place. If they don’t respect God, they will not respect relationships with
others. If I say she is my sister, they will try to pay me a bride price to get her. But if I
say she is my wife, they will kill me to get her.’
GENESIS 20:12
31
GENESIS 21:12
12 Besides, she really can be considered my sister, because she is the daughter of my
father, although she is not the daughter of my mother. She is the daughter of another
woman, and I married her.
13 Later, when God told me to move away from my father’s household, I said to her,
‘This is the way you can show that you love me: Everywhere we go, say about me,
“This is my brother.” ’ ”
14 So Abimelech brought some sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and
gave them to Abraham. And he returned his wife Sarah to him.
whatever place you like!”
This is to insure that no one will bring up this matter again and say that I have done
something wrong. [EUP, IDM]”
17 Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech’s wife and his slave
girls so that they could become pregnant.
18 This was because Yahweh had caused it to be impossible for any of the women
in Abimelech’s household to bear children, because Abimelech had taken Abraham’s
wife Sarah.
21
Sarah gave birth to Isaac
1 Yahweh was very kind to Sarah, just as he said he would be.
He did for Sarah
exactly what he promised to do.
2 She became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Abraham when he was very old,
at the time God promised it would happen.
3 Abraham gave the name ‘Isaac’ (which means ‘he laughs’) to the son Sarah gave
birth to.
4 Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when his son was eight days old, just as God
commanded him to do.
5 Abraham was 100 years old when his son Isaac was born.
6 And Sarah said, “Although I was sad before because I did not have any children,
God has now enabled me to laugh, and everyone who hears about what God has done
for me will laugh with me.”
7 Then she also said, “No one would have said to Abraham that some day Sarah
would nurse a child, but I have given birth to a son when Abraham is very old.”
Abraham sent Hagar and her son Ishmael away
8 The baby grew and was weaned when he was about three years old. On that day,
Abraham prepared a large feast to celebrate.
9 ◄One day/During the feast► Sarah noticed that Hagar’s son Ishmael was ◄making
fun of/playing with► Isaac.
10 So she said to Abraham, “Get rid of that slave woman from Egypt and her son! I
do not want the son of that slave woman to be alone (OR, to be an heir along with)
my son, Isaac!”
11 Abraham was very distressed about the matter, because he was concerned about
his son Ishmael.
12 But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed about your son, Ishmael, and
about your maidservant, Hagar. Do everything that Sarah tells you to do. Listen to
her, because Isaac is the one who will be considered the ancestor of the descendants
I promised to give you.
GENESIS 21:13
32
GENESIS 21:34
14 So Abraham got up early the next morning. He got some food ready, put water
sent them away.
They wandered in the desert near Beersheba town.
15 After they had drunk all the water in the container, she put her son under one
of the bushes there.
16 Then she went and sat nearby, about ◄as far as someone can shoot an arrow/100
meters away►, because she thought, “I cannot endure seeing my son die!” As she sat
there, she began to cry loudly [MTY].
17 The boy was crying too. And God heard the boy crying. So he caused one of
his angels to call out from heaven to Hagar, saying, “Hagar, are you worried about
something? Do not be afraid, because God has heard the boy crying there.
18 Help your son up, and hold his hand as you leave, because I will cause his
descendants to become a great nation.”
19 Then God showed her a well of water. So she went to the well and filled the
container with water, and gave the boy a drink.
20 God helped the boy as he grew up.
He lived in the desert and became a good
◄archer/man who hunts with bow and arrows►.
21 He lived in Paran Desert. While e was there, Hagar got a wife for him from Egypt.
22 At that time, King Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, said to
Abraham, “It is clear that God helps you with everything that you do.
23 So now ◄solemnly promise/swear► to me here, as God is listening, that you will
◄not deceive/act fairly to► me and my children and my descendants, in return for
my being kind to you. Be kind to me and to all the people here in the country where
you are now living.”
24 So Abraham promised to do that.
25 Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about one of Abraham’s wells that
Abimelech’s servants had seized.
26 But Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done that. You did not tell me
previously, and I did not hear about it until today.”
27 So Abraham brought some sheep and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of
them made a ◄treaty/peace agreement►.
28 Abraham separated seven female lambs from his flock.
29 Abimelech asked Abraham, “What are these seven female lambs that you have
separated from the rest of your flock?”
30 Abraham replied, “I want you truly to accept these female lambs from me [SYN],
so that it may be a ◄public witness/proof► that this well belongs to me because I dug
it.”
31 So Abimelech accepted the animals, and as a result they called that place
Beersheba, which means ‘Friendship Agreement Well’, because there the two of them
made that agreement.
32 After they made the agreement at Beersheba, Abimelech and his army
commander, Phicol, left, and returned to the land of the Philistine people-group.
33 Abraham planted a ◄tamarisk tree/ kind of tree called esel► there, and he
worshiped the eternal God there.
34 Abraham lived in the land of the Philistine people-group for a long time.
GENESIS 22:1

GENESIS 22:19
22
Yahweh told Abraham to offer Isaac as a sacrifice
1 Several years later, God tested Abraham to find out whether Abraham really trusted
in him and would obey him. He called out to Abraham, and Abraham replied, “I’m
here.”
2 God said, “Your son, Isaac, whom you love very much, is the only son who is still
here with you. But take him and go together to the Moriah region. Offer him as a
sacrifice like a burnt offering, on a hill that I will show you.”
3 So Abraham got up early the next morning, put a saddle on his donkey, and took
with him two of his servants along with his son, Isaac. He also chopped some wood
to kindle a fire for a burnt offering. Then they started traveling to the place God told
him about.
4 On the third day of their travels, Abraham looked up and saw in the distance the
place where God wanted him to go.
5 Abraham said to his servants, “You two stay here with the donkey while the boy
and I go over there. We will worship God there, and then we will come back to you.”
6 Then Abraham took the wood to kindle a fire for the burnt offering and placed
it on his son Isaac, for him to carry. Abraham carried in his hand a pan containing
burning coals to start a fire, and a knife, and the two of them walked along together.
7 Then Isaac spoke to his father Abraham, saying, “My father!” Abraham replied,
“Yes, my son, I’m here!” Isaac said, “Look, we have wood and coals to light a fire,
but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”
8 Abraham replied, “My son, God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt
offering.” So the two of them continued walking along together.
9 They arrived at the place God had told him about. There, Abraham built a stone
altar and arranged the wood on top of it. Then he tied his son Isaac, and laid him on
the altar on top of the wood.
10 Then Abraham took the knife and reached out to kill his son.
11 But an angel who was really Yahweh called to him from heaven and said,
“Abraham! Abraham!” Abraham replied, “I’m here!”
12 The angel said, “Do not harm the boy or do anything to injure him, because now
I know that you respect and obey God. I know that because you have not refused to
sacrifice your son, the only son who is still with you.”
13 Then Abraham looked up and saw that a ram was nearby, whose horns had been
caught in a ◄thicket/clump of bushes►. So Abraham went over and grabbed the ram
and killed it, and sacrificed it on the altar as a burnt offering, instead of his son.
14 Abraham named that place ‘Yahweh will provide’. And to the present day, people
say, “On Yahweh’s mountain, he will provide.”
15 The angel who was really Yahweh called out to Abraham from heaven a second
time.
16 He said, “I, Yahweh your Lord, am telling you that you did what I told you, and
you have not refused to sacrifice your only son that is with you. So I say, ‘I solemnly
swear, with myself as my witness,
the grains of sand on the seashore. And your descendants will defeat their enemies
18 You obeyed me, so by means of your descendants the people of all the nations
19 Then Abraham and Isaac returned to where his servants were waiting, and they
went back home together to Beersheba, and Abraham stayed there.
GENESIS 22:20
34
GENESIS 23:18
20 After these things happened, someone told Abraham, “Your brother Nahor’s wife,
Milcah, has also given birth to children. She has eight sons.”
21 The oldest son was Uz. The next was Buz. After him was Kemuel, the father of
Aram.
22 After Kemuel was Kesad, then Hazo, then Pildash, then Jidlaph, then Bethuel,
23 who was the father of Rebekah, who later became Isaac’s wife. Those were the
eight sons of Milcah, wife of Abraham’s brother, Nahor.
24 Nahor also had a ◄concubine/female slave whom he took as a wife►, whose
name was Beumah. She gave birth to four sons: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
23
After Sarah died, Abraham bought a burial place for her
1 When Sarah was 127 years old,
2 she died at Kiriath-Arba town, which is now called Hebron, in the Canaan region.
After Abraham mourned for her,
3 he left the body of his wife and went and spoke to some of the descendants of
Heth, saying,
4 “I am a foreigner [DOU] living among you, so I do not own any land here. Sell me
some land here so that I can bury my wife’s body.”
5 They replied to him,
6 “Sir, you are a powerful prince among us. Choose one of our finest tombs and
bury your wife’s body in it. None of us will refuse to sell land to you for a tomb for
your relatives’ bodies.”
7 Then Abraham stood up and bowed in respect in front of the people who owned
the land, the descendants of Heth.
8 He said to them, “If you say that you are willing for me to bury my wife’s body
here, listen to me, and ask Ephron, the son of Zohar for me,
9 to sell to me the cave in the Machpelah area, which is at the end of his field. Ask
him to sell it to me for the full price he wants, so that I can have a burial ground
among you.”
10 Ephron was sitting among the people near the city gate where many [HYP]
descendants of Heth had gathered. He heard what Abraham said to them.
11 So, just to make the customary reply to start the real discussion about a price,
Ephron said, “No, sir, listen to me. I will give to you the field and the cave in it,
without charge, with the people here as witnesses.”
12 Abraham again bowed before the people who lived in the area,
13 and said to Ephron, as all the others were listening, “No, listen to me. If you are
willing, I will pay for the field. You tell me what the price is, and I will give it to you.
If you accept it, the field will become mine, and I can bury my wife’s body there.”
14 Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,
important to you and me. Give me the money and bury your wife’s body there.”
pieces of silver he had suggested, as everyone was listening, using the standard
17 So Ephron’s field in the Machpelah area, near Mamre, and the cave in the field,
and all the trees that were in the field inside the boundaries of the land, became
Abraham’s possession.
18 It became Abraham’s property as all the descendants of Heth were listening there
at the city gate.
GENESIS 23:19
35
GENESIS 24:16
19 After that, Abraham buried his wife Sarah’s body in the cave in the field in the
Machpelah area near Mamre, which is now called Hebron city, in the Canaan region.
20 So the field and the cave in it were officially sold to Abraham by the descendants
of Heth, to be used as a burial ground.
24
Abraham sent a servant to Mesopotamia to find a wife for Isaac
1 Abraham was now a very old man. Yahweh had blessed Abraham in many ways.
2 One day Abraham said to the chief servant of his household, the man who was in
charge of everything Abraham owned, “Put your hand between my thighs to solemnly
promise you will do what I tell you.
3 Knowing that Yahweh God who created the heavens and the earth is listening,
promise that you will not get a wife for my son, Isaac, from the women here in
Canaan.
4 Instead, go back to my country and to my relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac
from among them.”
5 The servant asked him, “If I find a woman among your relatives, what if she is
not willing to come back with me to this land? Shall I take your son back there to the
country you came from, so he can find a wife and live there?”
6 Abraham replied to him, “No! Be certain that you don’t take my son there!
7 Yahweh God, who created the heavens, brought me here. He brought me from
my father’s household, and from the land where my relatives lived. He spoke to me
and made a solemn promise to me, saying, ‘I will give this land of Canaan to your
descendants.’ He will send an angel who will go there ahead of you, and enable you
to get a wife for my son there and bring her to live here.
8 But if the woman you find will not come back with you, you are free to disregard
the promise you are making. The only thing that you must not do is to take my son
to live there!”
9 So the servant put his hand between Abraham’s thighs and made a solemn
promise about the matter.
Abraham’s servant found a wife for Isaac
10 Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and loaded them with all kinds
of goods that his master gave him to take along. Then he left to go to Aram-Naharaim,
which is in ◄northern Mesopotamia/Syria►. He arrived in Nahor city.
11 It was late in the afternoon, at the time when the women go to the well to get
was outside the city.
me to be successful today! Act kindly to my master, Abraham!
13 Listen to me. I am standing near a well of water, and the young women of the
city are coming to get water.
14 I am asking you this: ‘I will say to some girl, “Please lower your jar so that I may
drink some water.” If she says, “Drink some, and I will draw some water from the
well for your camels, too,” I will know that she is the woman whom you chose to be a
wife for your servant, Isaac, and I will know that you have been kind to my master.’ ”
15 Before he finished praying, amazingly, Rebekah arrived there, carrying a jar on
her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel, who was the son of Milcah, the wife
of Abraham’s younger brother Nahor.
16 She was very beautiful and still a virgin. She went down to the edge of the well,
filled her jar with water, and then came back up.
GENESIS 24:17
36
GENESIS 24:39
17 Abraham’s servant immediately ran to meet her, and said, “Please give me a little
water from your jar.”
18 She replied, “Drink some, sir!” She lowered her jar from her shoulder to her
hands and gave him a drink.
19 After she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will also get some water
for your camels, until they have had enough to drink.”
20 She quickly emptied the water in her jar into the trough for giving water to
animals, and then ran back to the well, and kept getting water for all the camels.
21 The servant just watched her, without saying anything. He wanted to know if
Yahweh had caused his trip to be successful or not.
22 Finally, after the camels finished drinking, the servant took out a gold nose ring
that weighed ◄two ounces/6 grams►, and two large gold bracelets for her arms, and
gave them to Rebekah and told her to put them on.
23 Then he said, “Tell me whose daughter you are. Also, tell me, is there room in
your father’s house for me and my men to sleep there tonight?”
24 She replied, “My father’s name is Bethuel. He is the son of Nahor and his wife
Milcah.
25 Yes, we have room where you all can sleep tonight, and we also have plenty of
straw and grain to feed the camels.”
26 The servant bowed and worshiped Yahweh.
27 He said, “I thank you, Yahweh God, whom my master Abraham worships. You
have continued to be kind and faithful to my master. You led me on this journey
straight/directly to the house of my master’s relatives!”
28 The girl ran and told everyone in her mother’s household about what had
happened.
29 Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban.
Laban went quickly to
Abraham’s servant, who was still by the well.
30 He was surprised to have seen the bracelets on his sister’s arms and the nose
and saw the man standing near the camels, close to the well.
◄Why are standing out here?/You should not keep standing out here!► [RHQ] I have
prepared a room for you in the house, and a place for the camels to stay.”
32 So the servant went to the house, and Laban’s servants unloaded the camels, and
brought straw and grain for the camels, and water for him and the men with him to
wash their feet.
33 They set food in front of him for him to eat, but he said, “I will not eat until I tell
you ◄what I need to tell you/why I have come►.” So Laban said, “Tell us!”
34 So the servant said, “I am Abraham’s servant.
35 Yahweh has greatly blessed my master so that he has become very rich. Yahweh
has given him many sheep and cattle, a lot of gold and silver, male and female
servants, camels and donkeys.
36 My master’s wife, Sarah, bore a son for him when she was very old, and my
master has given to his son everything he owns.
37 My master made me solemnly promise, saying, ‘Do not get a wife for my son
from the women here in Canaan.
38 Instead, go back to my father’s family, to my own clan, and get from them a wife
for my son.’
39 Then I asked my master, ‘What shall I do if the woman you show me will not
come back with me?’
GENESIS 24:40
37
GENESIS 24:60
40 He replied, ‘Yahweh, whom I have always obeyed [MTY], will send his angel with
you, and he will cause your journey to be successful, with the result that you can get
a wife for my son from my clan, from my father’s family.
41 But if my clan refuses to allow her to return with you, you will be freed from
being cursed because of not obeying me.’
42 “When I came today to the well,
I prayed, ‘Yahweh God whom my master,
Abraham worships, if you are willing, please allow this journey of mine to be
successful.
43 Listen to me. I am standing beside a well. A young woman may come to draw
water. I will say to her, “Please, give me a little water to drink from your jar.”
44 If she says to me, “Certainly, drink some! And I will also draw some water for
your camels,” that will be the woman whom you have chosen for my master’s son!’
45 Before I finished praying, amazingly, Rebekah approached with her water jar on
her shoulder. She went down to the well and got some water. I said to her, ‘Please
give me a drink!’
46 She quickly lowered her jar and said, ‘Drink some! And I will draw water from
the well for your camels, too.’ So I drank some water, and she also got water for the
camels.
47 Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel,
the son of Nahor and his wife, Milcah.’ I had a ring and bracelets with me, and I put

So we two cannot say anything more.
51 Rebekah is here in front of you. Take her and go, and let her be a wife for your
master’s son, just as Yahweh has indicated.”
52 When Abraham’s servant heard these words, he bowed down to the ground to
thank Yahweh.

slept there that night. The next morning, the servant said, “Allow me now to return
to my master.”
55 But her brother and her mother replied, “Let the girl remain with us for about
ten days. After that, you may take her and go.”
56 But he replied to them, “Yahweh has made my journey successful, so do not
detain me. Let me take her back to my master now!”
57 They said, “Let’s call Rebekah and ask her what she wants to do.” [MTY]
58 So they summoned Rebekah and asked her, “Will you go with this man now?”
She replied, “Yes, I will go.”
59 So they allowed Rebekah, a woman who had taken care of her when she was
very young, Abraham’s servant, and the men who had come with him. to go.
60 Before they all left, they asked God to bless Rebekah, and said to her, “Our sister,
we ask that Yahweh will cause you to have millions of descendants, and allow them
to completely defeat [MET] all those that hate them.”

GENESIS 25:17
61 Then Rebekah and her maid servants got ready and got on their camels and went
with Abraham’s servant.
62 At that time, Isaac was living in the Negev desert. He had gone there from BeerLahai-Roi.
63 One evening he went out into the field to meditate as he walked. He looked up
and was surprised to see some camels coming.
64 Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got off the camel,
65 and asked the servant, “Who is that man who is approaching?” The servant
replied, “That is Isaac, my master, the man you will be marrying.” So she took her
veil and covered her face, which was the custom for a woman who was about to be
married.
66 The servant told Isaac everything that had happened.
67 Then Isaac took Rebekah into the tent that belonged to his mother, Sarah, and

Abraham died and was buried near Sarah
1 Some time after Sarah died, Abraham married another woman, whose name was
Keturah.
2 She later gave birth to six sons: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and
3 Jokshan became the father of two sons, Sheba and Dedan. The descendants of

slaves that he had taken to be his secondary wives►, and then he sent them away to
live in a land to the east, to keep them far from his son Isaac.
7 Abraham lived until he was 175 years old.
8 He died at a very old age, joining his ancestors who had died previously [DOU].
9 His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried his body in the cave at Machpelah area, near
Mamre, in the field that Abraham had previously bought from Ephron, one of the
descendants of Heth.
10 Isaac and Ishmael buried his body there, where Abraham previously buried his
wife Sarah.
11 After Abraham died, God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac moved to live near
Beer-Lahai-Roi.
The descendants of Ishmael
12 ◄These are/I will now give a list of► the descendants of Abraham’s son, Ishmael,
to whom Sarah’s female slave, Hagar from Egypt, had given birth.
13 These are their names, in the order in which they were born: Ishmael’s oldest
son was named Nebaioth. After him were born Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
14 Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
15 Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.

18 His descendants ◄settled/went to live► in the area between Shur and Havilah,
near the border of Egypt as a person travels toward Asshur. All of their camps were
close to each other (OR, they all frequently attacked each other).
The birth of Esau and Jacob
19 ◄This is an account of/I will now tell you about► Abraham’s son, Isaac. Abraham
became the father of Isaac,
20 and when Isaac was 40 years old, he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel.
Bethuel was one of the descendants of Aram from Paddan-Aram. Rebekah was the
sister of Laban, who belonged to the Aram people-group.
21 Almost 20 years after they were married, Rebekah still had no children. So Isaac
prayed to Yahweh concerning his wife, and Yahweh answered his prayer. His wife
Rebekah became pregnant.
22 She was carrying twins in her womb, and they kept jostling each other. So she
said, “Why is it that this is happening to me?” So she asked Yahweh about it.
23 Yahweh said to her, “The older one of your twins will serve the younger one. The
twins will be ancestors of two nations. And those two people-groups will separate
from each other.” [CHI]
24 When Rebekah gave birth, it was true! Twin boys were born!
made of hair. So they named him Esau, which sounds like the Hebrew word that
26 Then his brother was born, grasping Esau’s heel. So they named him Jacob, which
were born.
Esau sold his rights as the oldest son
27 When the boys grew up, Esau became a skilled hunter. He spent a lot of time out
in the fields. Jacob was a quiet man who stayed close to the campsite.
28 Isaac liked Esau more, because he enjoyed the taste of the meat of the animals
that Esau killed. But Rebekah liked Jacob more.
29 One day while Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came home from the field,
very hungry.
30 He said to Jacob, “Give me some of that red stew to eat right now, because I
am very hungry!” [That is why Esau’s other name was Edom, which sounds like the
Hebrew word that means ‘red’.]
31 Jacob said, “I will give you some if you sell me ◄your birthright/the privileges
you have because you are the firstborn son►.”
32 Esau replied, “Well, I am about to die from being so hungry. If I die now, ◄my
birthright will not benefit me./What good will my birthright be to me?►” [RHQ]
33 Jacob said, “◄Swear to/ Solemnly promise► me that you are giving me the
privileges that you will have from being the firstborn son!” So that is what Esau
did. He sold his birthright to Jacob.
34 Then Jacob gave to Esau some bread and some stew made of lentils/beans. Esau
ate and drank, and then he got up and left. By doing that, Esau showed that he ◄was
not interested in/did not value► the privileges that would be his because of being the
firstborn son.
26
Isaac deceived King Abimelech
GENESIS 26:1
40
GENESIS 26:18
1 Some time later there was a severe ◄famine/scarcity of food► there.
That was
different from the famine that occurred when Abraham was alive. So Isaac went
southeast to Gerar town, to talk to Abimelech, the king of the Philistine people-group.
What happened was this: Isaac considered going to Egypt,
2 but Yahweh appeared to him and said, “Do not go down to Egypt! Live in the land
where I will tell you to go!
3 Stay in this land for a while, and I will help you and bless you, because it is to you
and your descendants that I will give all these lands, and I will do what I solemnly
promised to your father.
4 I will cause your descendants to be as numerous as the stars in the sky. I will
give to your descendants all these lands, and I will cause your descendants to be a
blessing to the people of [MTY] all nations on the earth.
5 I will do that because your father Abraham obeyed me. He obeyed everything
So Isaac went and asked King Abimelech if he would permit him to live in the Gerar
6 so Isaac stayed there along with his wife and sons.
sister.” He said that because he was afraid to say, “She is my wife.” He thought,
“Rebekah is very beautiful, so they will want her. If I say that she is my sister, they
know they will have to negotiate about a bride price because I am her older brother;
but if I say that she is my wife, no negotiation will be possible. They will just kill me
to get her.”
8 When Isaac had been there a long time, one day Abimelech, the king of the
Philistine people-group, looked down from a window in his palace and was surprised
to see Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.
9 So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said to him, “Now I realize that she is really
your wife! So why did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac replied to him, “I said that
because I thought that someone here might kill me to get her.”
10 Abimelech said, “◄You should not have done this to us!/Why did you do this?►
[RHQ] One of our people might have ◄had sex with/slept with► [EUP] your wife, and
you would have caused us to be guilty of a great sin!”
11 Then Abimelech commanded all his people, saying, “Do not harm/molest this
man or his wife! Anyone who does that will surely be executed!”
The Philistines argued with Isaac about wells
12 Isaac planted grain in that land that year, and he harvested a very large crop,
because Yahweh blessed him.
13 Isaac continued to acquire more and more possessions, until finally he became
very wealthy.
14 He had large herds of sheep and goats and cattle, and many slaves. Because of
that, the Philistine people envied him.
15 So all the wells that the servants of his father Abraham had dug during the time
when he was alive, the people filled up with dirt.
16 Then Abimelech said to Isaac, “You people have become more numerous than
we are, so I want you to get out of our area.”
17 So Isaac and his family moved from there. They set up their tents in Gerar Valley
and started to live there.
18 There were several wells in that area that had been dug when Isaac’s father
Abraham was living, but Philistine people had filled them up with dirt after Abraham
GENESIS 26:19
41
GENESIS 27:1
died. Now Isaac and his servants removed the dirt, and Isaac gave the wells the same
names that his father had given to them.
19 Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water.
20 But other men who lived in Gerar Valley who took care of their animals argued/
quarreled with the men who took care of Isaac’s animals, and said, “The water in
this well is ours!” So Isaac named the well Esek, which means ‘dispute’, because they
disputed about who owned it.
21 Then Isaac’s servants dug another well, but they quarreled about who owned
that one also. So Isaac named it Sitnah, which means ‘opposition’.
22 They moved on from there and dug another well, but this time no one quarreled
saying, “Yahweh has given us an uninhabited place to live in, a place that is not

whom your father Abraham worshiped. Do not be afraid of anything. I will help you
and bless you, and because of what I promised my servant Abraham, I will greatly
increase the number of your descendants.”
25 So Isaac built a stone altar there and offered a sacrifice to worship Yahweh. He
and his servants set up their tents there, and his servants started to dig a well.
Isaac made a peace treaty with King Abimelech
26 While they were digging the well, King Abimelech came to Isaac from Gerar, along
with Ahuzzath, his advisor, and Phicol, the commander of his army.
27 Isaac asked them, “You ◄acted in a hostile way toward me/treated me like an
enemy► before, and sent me away. So why have you come to me now?”
28 One of them answered, “We have seen that Yahweh helps you. So we said to
each other, ‘We should have an agreement between us and you. We should make a
peace treaty with you,
29 stating that you will not harm us, in the same way that we did not molest [EUP]
you.’ We always treated you well and sent you away peacefully. And now Yahweh is
blessing you.”
30 So Isaac made a feast for them, and they all ate and drank.
31 Early the next morning they all ◄swore/solemnly promised► each other that they
would do what they had promised. Then Isaac sent them home peacefully.
32 That day Isaac’s servants came to him and told him about the well that they had
finished digging. They said, “We found water in the well!”
33 Isaac named the well Shibah, which sounds like the Hebrew word that means
‘oath’. To the present time the town there has the name Beersheba which means
‘Friendship Agreement Well’.
Esau married foreign women
34 When Esau was 40 years old, he married Judith, the daughter of Beeri, and
Basemath, the daughter of Elon. Both of those women were descendants of Heth,
not from Isaac’s clan.
35 Esau’s two wives made life miserable for Isaac and Rebekah.

Jacob received a blessing from Isaac by trickery

One day he summoned Esau, his

42
2 and said to him, “My son?” Esau replied, “Here I am!”
3 Isaac said, “Listen to me.
GENESIS 27:25
I am very old, and I do not know when I will die. So
hunt for a wild animal for me.
after I eat it, I can give you a blessing before I die.”
5 Rebekah was listening as Isaac said that to his son, Esau. So when Esau left the
tent to go to the countryside to hunt for a wild animal in order to kill it and bring it
back,
6 Rebekah said to her son, Jacob, “Listen to me. I heard your father talking to your
brother, Esau, saying,
7 ‘Go and kill some wild animal and bring it here, and prepare the meat in a tasty
way, so that I may eat it, and then before I die I can give you my blessing while
Yahweh is listening.’
8 So now, my son, do what I am telling you.
9 Go out to the flock and kill two nice young goats and bring the meat to me. Then
I will prepare some tasty food for your father, the way he likes it.
10 Then you can take it to your father, in order that he can eat it, and then, before
he dies, he will give his blessing to you, and not to your older brother.”
11 But Jacob said to his mother Rebekah, “But my brother Esau’s skin has hair all
over it, and my skin is not like that! My skin is smooth!
12 What will happen if my father touches me? He will realize that I am tricking
him, and as a result ◄I will be cursed/he will say that God will do bad things to► me,
not a blessing!”
13 His mother replied, “If that happens, let the curse be on me. You do what I am
telling you. Go and get the goats for me!”
14 So Jacob went and killed two goats and brought them to his mother. Then with
the meat his mother prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked.
15 Then Rebekah took her older son Esau’s clothes that were with her in the tent,
and she put them on her younger son Jacob.
16 She also put the skins of the young goats on his hands and the smooth part of his
neck.
17 Then she handed him some bread and the tasty food that she had prepared.
18 Jacob took it to his father and said, “My father!” Isaac replied, “I’m here; which
of my sons are you?”
19 Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau, your firstborn son. I did what you told me
to do. Sit up and eat some of the meat so that you can then bless me.”
20 But Isaac asked his son, “My son, how is it that you were able to find and kill an
animal so quickly?” Jacob replied, “Because Yahweh, whom you worship, enabled
me to be successful.”
21 Isaac said to Jacob, “Come near to me, my son, so that I can touch you and
determine whether you are really my son Esau.”
22 So Jacob went close to him. Isaac. Isaac touched him and said, “Your voice sounds
like Jacob, but your hands feel hairy, like the hands of your older brother, Esau.”
23 Isaac did not recognize Jacob, because he was blind and because Jacob’s hands
were now hairy, like those of his older brother, Esau. So Isaac prepared to bless Jacob.
24 But first Isaac asked, “Are you really my son Esau?” Jacob replied, “Yes, I am.”
25 Isaac said, “My son, bring me some of the meat that you have cooked, so that I
may eat it and then give you my blessing.” So Jacob brought him some, and he ate it.
Jacob also brought him some wine, and he drank it.
GENESIS 27:26
43
GENESIS 27:41
26 Then Isaac said to him, “My son, come here and kiss me.”
27 So Jacob came close to him, and his father kissed him on the cheek. Isaac smelled
the clothes Jacob was wearing. They smelled like Esau’s clothes. So he said,
“Truly, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that Yahweh has blessed.
28 I ask that God will send down to you dew from heaven to water your fields,
and cause you to have abundant crops,
good harvests of grain, and grapes for wine.
29 I ask that people of many nations will serve you and bow down to you.
I ask that you will rule over your brothers,
and that your mother’s descendants will also bow down to you.
I ask that God will curse/punish those who ◄curse you/ask God to do bad things to
you►,
and bless those who bless you.”
father was, when his older brother, Esau, returned from hunting.
31 Esau cooked some tasty meat and brought it to his father. He said to his father,
“My father, please sit up and eat some of the meat that I have cooked, so that you can
then give me your blessing!”
32 His father, Isaac, said to him, “Who are you?” He answered, “I am Esau, your
firstborn son!”
33 Then Isaac, realizing that it was not Esau who had come earlier, trembled very
violently. He said, “Then who is it that brought me some meat from an animal that he
had hunted and killed, and I ate it all? He was here just before you came. I blessed
him, and I cannot ◄take back that blessing/declare that those things will not happen
to him►.”
34 When Esau heard those words of his father, he cried loudly. He was very
disappointed. He said to his father, “My father, bless me, too!”
35 But his father said, “Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing!”
36 Esau said, “It is right [RHQ] that his name is Jacob, which means ‘cheat,’ because
he deceived me two times. The first time he took my rights from being his firstborn
son, and this time he took my blessing!” Then he asked, “Do you not have any blessing
left for me?”
37 Isaac answered and said to Esau, “I have declared that your younger brother will
rule over you, and declared that all his relatives will serve him. And I have said that
God will give him plenty of grain and grapes for wine. So, my son, ◄what can I do
for you?/There is nothing more that I can do for you!►” [RHQ]
38 Esau said to his father, “My father, do you have only one blessing? My father,
bless me, too!” Then Esau cried very loudly.
39 His father Isaac answered and said to him,
“The place where you will live will be far from the fertile soil and from the dew that
God sends from heaven to water the fields.
40 You will rob and kill people [MTY] in order to get what you need to live,
and you will be as though you are your brother’s slave.
But when you decide to rebel against him, you will ◄free yourself from/no longer be
under► his control.”
Jacob fled from Esau
mourning for him, I will kill Jacob!”
GENESIS 27:42
44
GENESIS 28:13
42 But Rebekah found out what her older son, Esau, was thinking. So she summoned
her younger son, Jacob, and said to him, “Listen to me. Your older brother, Esau, is
comforting himself by planning to kill you, to get revenge because of your deceiving
your father.
43 So now, my son, listen carefully to what I am telling you. Escape quickly and go
and stay with my brother Laban, in Haran town.
44 Stay with him a while, until your older brother is no longer angry.
45 When he forgets what you did to him, I will send a message to you, to tell you to
return from there. If Esau kills you, others will kill him, and then both my sons would
die at the same time!” [RHQ]
46 Rebekah also said to Isaac, “These foreign women whom Esau has married, who
are descendants of Heth, are making my life miserable. I would prefer to die than to
see Jacob marry a woman from the descendants of Heth in this area!”
28
Isaac gave instructions to Jacob
1 Then Isaac summoned Jacob, and gave him a blessing. He told him, “Do not marry
a woman of the Canaan people-group.
2 Instead, go right away to Paddan-Aram in northwest Mesopotamia, to the house
of your mother’s father Bethuel. Ask one of the daughters of your mother’s brother
Laban to marry you.
3 I will pray that God Almighty will bless you, and enable you to get married and
have many descendants, in order that they will become many people-groups.
4 I also will pray that he will bless you and your descendants by enabling you to
possess/seize the land in which you are now living as a foreigner, the land that God
promised to give to my father Abraham and his descendants.”
5 So Isaac sent Jacob to Paddan-Aram, to live with Rebekah’s brother Laban, the
son of Bethuel, who belonged to the Aram people-group.
Esau married Ishmael’s daughter
6 Esau found out that his father Isaac had blessed Jacob and then sent him to
Paddan-Aram. He also found out that when he blessed Isaac, he told him, “Do not
marry a woman of the Canaan people-group,”
7 and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother, and had gone to Paddan-Aram.
8 Esau also realized that his father Isaac did not approve of women from the Canaan
people-group.
9 Because of that, Esau went to see his uncle Ishmael, and married Mahalath, the
daughter of Ishmael. Mahalath was the sister of Nabaioth and the granddaughter of
Abraham.
God made a promise to Jacob in a dream
11 When he arrived at a certain place, he stopped there, because the sun had gone
down. He took one of the stones there and put it under his head to use as a pillow.
12 While he was sleeping, he had a dream, in which he was surprised to see a
stairway. The bottom of the stairway was on the earth and the top was in the sky.
Jacob also saw that God’s angels were going up and down the stairway.
13 And he was surprised to see Yahweh standing at the top of the stairway, saying
“I am Yahweh God, whom your grandfather Abraham worshiped, and whom Isaac
worships. I will give to you and to your descendants the land on which you are lying.
GENESIS 28:14
45
GENESIS 29:10
14 Your descendants will be as numerous as the particles of dirt that are on the
earth, and their territory will be very large. It will extend in all directions, to the east
and to the west, to the north and to the south. And people of all people-groups on
earth will receive blessings because of what happens to you and to your descendants.
15 I will help you and protect you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to
this land. I will not leave you; I will continue to do for you all that I have promised
to do.”
16 During the night, when Jacob woke up from sleeping, he thought, “Surely Yahweh
is in this place, and until now I was not aware of it!”
17 He was afraid, and he said, “This place is very awesome! This is surely the place
where God lives, and this is the entrance to heaven!”
18 In the morning Jacob got up and took the stone that he had put under his head
and set it up on its end to show that the place was a holy place. He poured some olive
oil on top of the stone to dedicate it to God.
19 He named that place Bethel, which means ‘house of God’. Previously its name
was Luz.
20 Jacob solemnly promised God, saying, “God, if you will help me and protect me
while I am taking this journey, and if you give me enough food to eat and clothes to
wear,
21 in order that I can later return safely to my father’s house, then you, Yahweh,
will be the God that I will worship.
22 This stone that I have set up will mark the place where people can worship you.
And I will give back to you a tenth of everything that you give to me.”
29
Jacob met Laban’s daughter Rachel at Haran
1 Jacob continued on the road [MTY], and he arrived at the land that was east of
Canaan.
2 There he was surprised to see a well in a field, and three flocks of sheep were
lying near the well. It was the well from which shepherds habitually got water for
their sheep. There was a large stone covering the top of the well.
3 When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would work together to
roll the stone away from the top of the well and get water for the sheep. When they
finished doing that, they would put the stone back in its place over the top of the well.

be gathered for nighttime. Give the sheep some water and then take them back to
◄graze/eat grass► in the pastures!”
8 They replied, “No, we cannot do that until all the flocks are gathered here and
the stone is removed from the top of the well. After that, we will give water to the
sheep.”
9 While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep. She
was the one who took care of her father’s sheep.
10 When Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, who was his mother’s brother,
Jacob was so excited that he went over and by himself rolled away the stone that
covered the top of the well, and he got water for his uncle’s sheep.
GENESIS 29:11
46
GENESIS 29:31
11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel on the cheek, and he cried loudly because he was so
happy.
12 Jacob told Rachel that he was one of her father’s relatives, the son of her aunt
Rebekah. So she ran and told that to her father.
13 As soon as Laban heard that Jacob, his sister’s son, was there, he ran to meet
him. He embraced him and kissed him on the cheek. Then he brought him to his
home, and Jacob told him all that had happened to him.
14 Then Laban said to him, “Truly, you are part of my family!”
Jacob married Leah and Rachel
After Jacob had stayed there and worked for Laban for a month,
15 Laban said to him “◄You should not work for me for nothing just because you
are a relative of mine!/Why should you work for me for nothing just because you are
a relative of mine?► [RHQ] Tell me how much you want me to pay you.”
16 Well, Laban had two daughters. The older one was named Leah, and the younger
one was named Rachel.
17 Leah had pretty eyes, but Rachel had a very attractive figure and was beautiful.
18 Jacob ◄was in love with/wanted very much to be married to► Rachel, and he
said, “I will work for you for seven years. That will be my payment for your letting
me marry your younger daughter, Rachel.”
19 Laban replied, “It is better for me to let you marry her than for her to marry
20 So Jacob worked for Laban for seven years to get Rachel, but to him it seemed
21 After the seven years were ended, Jacob said to Laban, “Let me marry Rachel
now, because the time we agreed upon for me to work for you is ended, and I want
to marry her. [EUP]”
22 So Laban gathered together all the people who lived in that area and made a
feast.
23 But that evening, instead of taking Rachel to Jacob, Laban took his older daughter,
Leah, to him. But because it was already dark, he could not see that it was Leah and
not Rachel, and he had sex [EUP] with her.
24 (Laban had already given his slave girl Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her
maid/servant.)
25 The next morning, Jacob was shocked to see that it was Leah who was with
him! So he went to Laban and told him very angrily, “◄What you have done to me
is disgusting!/What is this that you have done to me?► [RHQ] I worked for you to get
Rachel, did I not? So why did you deceive me?”
26 Laban replied, “In this land, it is not our custom to give a younger daughter to
be married before we let someone marry our firstborn daughter.
27 After we finish this week of celebration, we will let you marry the younger one
also. But in return, you must pay for Rachel by working for me for another seven
years.”
28 So that is what Jacob did. After the week of celebration was ended, Laban gave
him his daughter, Rachel, to be his wife.
29 Laban gave his slave girl, Bilhah, to Rachel to be her maid/servant.
30 Jacob had sex [EUP] with Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than he loved
Leah. And Jacob worked for Laban for another seven years.
Leah gave birth to four sons
31 When Yahweh saw that Jacob did not love Leah very much, he enabled her to
become pregnant. But Rachel was not able to become pregnant.
GENESIS 29:32
words that mean ‘Look, a son!’ She said, “Yahweh has seen that I was miserable, and
because of that he has given me a son. Now, surely my husband will love me for
giving birth to a son for him.”
33 Later she became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She said,
“Because Yahweh has heard that my husband doesn’t love me, he has given me this
son, too.” So she named him Simeon, which means ‘someone who hears’.
34 Later she became pregnant again, and gave birth to another son. She said, “Now,
finally, my husband will hold me close to him.” So she named him Levi, which means
‘hold close’.
35 Later she became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She said, “◄This
time/Now► I will praise Yahweh.” So she called his name Judah, which sounds like
the Hebrew word that means ‘praise’. After that, she did not give birth to any more
children for several years.
30
Jacob had more sons and a daughter
1 Rachel realized that she was not becoming pregnant and giving birth to any
children for Jacob. So she became jealous of her older sister, Leah, because Leah
had given birth to four sons. She said to Jacob, “Enable me to become pregnant and
give birth to children. If you do not do that, I think I will die!”
2 Jacob became angry with Rachel and said, “◄I am not God!/Am I God?► [RHQ] He
is the one who has prevented you from becoming pregnant!”
3 Then she said, “Look, here is my female slave, Bilhah. ◄Sleep with/Have sex with►
[EUP] her, so that she may become pregnant and give birth to children for me. In that
4 So she gave him her slave, Bilhah, to be another wife for him, and Jacob had sex
5 She became pregnant and bore Jacob a son.
I have done is right►. He has also heard my requests and has given me a son.” So
she named him Dan, which sounds like the Hebrew word that means ‘he judged’.
7 Later, Rachel’s slave Bilhah became pregnant again and gave birth to another son
for Jacob.
8 Then Rachel said, “I have had a great struggle to have children like my older sister,
but truly I have a son.” So she named him Naphtali, which sounds like the Hebrew
word that means ‘struggle’.
9 When Leah realized that she was not becoming pregnant and giving birth to any
more children, she took her female slave, Zilpah, and gave her to Jacob to be another
wife for him.
10 Zilpah soon became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Jacob.
11 Leah said, “I am truly fortunate!”
So she named him Gad, which means
‘fortunate’.
12 Later Leah’s slave, Zilpah, gave birth to another son for Jacob.
13 Leah said, “Now I am very happy, and people will call me happy.” So she named
him Asher, which means ‘happy.’
◄mandrakes/plants that women eat to help them to become pregnant►. He brought
some of them to his mother Leah. But Rachel saw them and said to Leah, “Please
give me some of those plants that your son brought to you!”
GENESIS 30:15
48
GENESIS 30:33
15 But Leah said to her, “No!
◄It was bad that you stole my husband!/Is it not
bad enough that you stole my husband?► [RHQ] Now ◄are you going to take my
son’s mandrake plants?/You want to take my son’s mandrake plants also, so that you
can become pregnant!►” [RHQ] So Rachel said, “All right, Jacob can sleep with you
tonight, if you give me some of your son’s mandrake plants.” So Leah ◄agreed/gave
her some►.
16 When Jacob returned from the wheat fields that evening, Leah went out to meet
him. She said, “You must sleep with me tonight, because I gave Rachel some of my
son’s mandrakes that enable women to become pregnant, to pay her for allowing us
to do that.” So Jacob slept with her that night.
17 God answered Leah’s prayers, and she became pregnant and bore a fifth son to
Jacob.
18 Leah said, “God has rewarded me for giving my slave to my husband to be
another wife for him.” So she named him Issachar, which sounds like the Hebrew
word that means ‘reward’.
19 Leah became pregnant again and bore a sixth son for Jacob.
20 Leah said, “God has given me a precious gift. ◄This time/Now► my husband will
honor/respect me, because I have given birth to six sons for him.” So she named him
Zebulon, which sounds like the Hebrew word that means ‘accepted gift’.
21 Later she gave birth to a daughter, and named her Dinah.
22 Then God thought about what Rachel wanted. He heard her prayers and enabled
23 She became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She said, “God has caused that no
24 She named him Joseph, which sounds like the Hebrew words that mean ‘may he
give another’ and she said, ‘ want Yahweh to give me another son.’
Jacob tricked Laban and became very wealthy
25 After Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Now allow me to
quit working for you and let me return to my own land.
26 You know the work that I have done for you for a long time to get my wives. So
let me take my wives and my children, and leave.”
27 But Laban said to him, “If you are pleased with me, stay here, because I have
found out by performing a magic ritual that Yahweh has blessed me because of what
you have done for me.
28 Tell me what you want me to pay you for continuing to work for me, and that is
what I will pay you.”
29 Jacob replied, “You know how I have worked for you, and you know that your
livestock have increased greatly as I have taken care of them.
30 You had only a few animals before I came here. But now you have very many,
and Yahweh has caused them to increase greatly in number wherever I have taken
them. But now I need to start taking care of the needs of my own family.”
31 Laban replied, “What do you want me to give you?” Jacob replied, “I do not want
you to pay me anything. But if you will do this one thing for me, I will continue to
take care of your flocks and protect them.
32 Allow me to go and look at all of your flocks today and remove from them all the
speckled sheep, all the spotted sheep, and every dark-colored lamb, all the goats that
are speckled, and all the goats that are spotted, and keep them for myself. They will
be my wages.
33 In that way, in the future, you will be able to know whether I have been honest
regarding what you have paid me. If any of my goats are neither speckled or spotted,
GENESIS 30:34
49
GENESIS 31:7
or if any of my lambs are not dark-colored, you will know that I have stolen them
from you.”
34 Laban agreed and said, “Okay, we will do as you have said.”
35 But that same day Laban removed all the male goats that had black and white
stripes on them or were spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled or
spotted, all the goats that were partly white, and all the dark-colored lambs. He
separated them and told his sons to take care of them.
36 Then he took these flocks and walked a distance of three days, in order that he
could be that far from Jacob. Jacob continued to take care of the rest of Laban’s
flocks.
37 Then Jacob cut some branches of ◄poplar, almond, and plane trees/three kinds
of trees that had white wood►. He peeled strips of bark from the branches, so that
where the bark had been peeled off, the branches were light in color.
38 Then he placed the peeled branches in the troughs where they put the water for
the animals to drink, so that the branches would be in front of the flocks when they
39 The animals also mated in front of the branches, and eventually they gave birth
black and white stripes on them.
and goats in Laban’s flock. And when his female sheep mated, he made them look
and the dark-colored animals. He did that so that the female sheep would give birth
for himself, and he kept them separate from Laban’s flocks.
41 In addition, whenever the stronger female sheep were ready to mate, Jacob put
some of those peeled branches in the troughs in front of them, so that they would
mate in front of the branches.
42 But when weak animals were ready to mate, he did not put the branches in their
troughs. So the weak ones became part of Laban’s flock, and the strong ones became
part of Jacob’s flock.
43 As a result, Jacob became very rich. He owned many large flocks of sheep and
goats, and many male and female slaves, and many camels and donkeys.
31
Jacob’s family fled from Laban
1 Someone told Jacob that Laban’s sons were complaining and saying, “Jacob has
become very rich by taking everything [HYP] that belonged to our father.”
2 And Jacob noticed that Laban was not acting friendly toward him as he had done
before.
3 Then Yahweh said to Jacob, “Go back to your country and your relatives, and I
will help you there.”
4 So Jacob sent a message to Rachel and Leah, telling them to come out to the
pastures where his flocks of sheep and goats were.
5 When they arrived, he said to them, “I see that your father does not act friendly
toward me as he did previously. But God, whom my father worshiped, has helped
me.
6 You two know that I have worked very hard for your father,
7 but many times [HYP] he has cheated me by decreasing my wages. But God has
not allowed him to harm me.
GENESIS 31:8
50
GENESIS 31:26
8 When Laban said, ‘The speckled animals are the ones that I will give you to be
your wages,’ then all the animals gave birth to young ones that were speckled. When
he changed and said, ‘The ones that have black and white stripes on them will be
your wages,’ then all the animals gave birth to young ones that were striped.
9 In that way, God has taken away the livestock that belonged to your father and
has given them to me.
10 “One time, when the animals were mating, I had a dream. In my dream I looked
up and was surprised to see that some of the male goats that were mating with the
female goats had black and white stripes on them, some were speckled, and some
were spotted.
11 An angel who was sent by God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob!’ I replied, ‘I am
here!’
12 He said to me, ‘Look up and you will see that all the male goats that are mating
because I have seen all that Laban has done to you.
13 I am God who appeared to you at Bethel, where you set up a stone to show that
the place was holy, and you poured olive oil on the stone and made a solemn promise
to me. So now leave this land immediately, and return to the land where you were
born.’ ”
14 Rachel and Leah replied, “Our father will not give us anything more when he
dies [RHQ].
15 He treats us as though we were foreigners [RHQ]! Your working for him all these
years was like a payment that you gave him as a price for us, but we will not inherit
any of that money that he got as a price for us. He has spent it all!
16 Surely all of the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and to
our children. So do whatever God has told you to do!”
17 Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels.
18 He made all his livestock go ahead of him. Besides the livestock, he took along
all the other things that he had acquired while living in Paddan-Aram. And they
prepared to return to his father Isaac, in the Canaan region.
19 Before they left, while Laban was shearing his sheep, Rachel stole the small
wooden idols that were in her father’s tent.
20 Furthermore, Jacob deceived Laban, who belonged to the Aram people-group, by
not telling him that they were planning to leave.
21 So Jacob and his family fled with all their possessions, and they crossed the
Euphrates River, and then started traveling south toward the hilly Gilead region.
Jacob rebuked Laban after Laban caught up with him
22 On the third day after they left, someone told Laban that Jacob and his family
had left.
23 So he took some of his relatives with him and started to pursue Jacob. They
continued walking for seven days.
24 Then God appeared to Laban in a dream at night, and said to him, “When you
catch up to Jacob, be sure that you do not say anything at all [HYP] to him in an angry
manner!”
25 The next day, by the time Laban caught up with Jacob, Jacob and his household
had set up their tents in the hilly Gilead region. So Laban and his relatives set up
their tents there, too.
26 Then Laban went to Jacob and said to him, “Why have you done this? You have
deceived me by carrying away my daughters as though you had captured them in a
war [MTY]!
GENESIS 31:27
51
GENESIS 31:42
27 Why did you run away and deceive me? Why did you not tell me that you were
going to leave, so that we could have rejoiced and sung while people played music
on tambourines and harps before I said ‘goodbye’ to you?
before they left!/Why did you not allow me to kiss my grandchildren and daughters
29 My relatives and I have the power to harm you, but last night the God whom
all to Jacob in an angry way.’
30 Now, I know you have left because you long to go back home. But why did you
steal my wooden idols?”
31 Jacob replied to Laban, saying, “I did not tell you that we were planning to leave,
because I was afraid. I thought that if I told you, you would forcefully take your
daughters away from me.
32 But if you find anyone here who has your wooden idols, we will execute that
person. While our relatives are watching, search for yourself to see if there is
anything that belongs to you that is here with me. If you find anything, you can
take it!” When Jacob said that, he did not know that Rachel had stolen the wooden
idols.
33 Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and then into Leah’s tent, and then into the tents
of the two female slaves and searched for the idols, but he did not find them. After
he left their tents, he entered Rachel’s tent.
34 But Rachel had previously taken the idols and put them in the saddle of a camel,
and she was sitting on the saddle. So when Laban searched all over for them inside
Rachel’s tent, he did not find them.
35 Rachel said to her father, “Do not be angry with me, sir, but I cannot get up in
your presence to show respect for you, because I am having my monthly menstrual
period. [EUP]” So when Laban searched some more, he did not find the wooden idols.
36 Then Jacob became angry. He rebuked Laban, saying, “What crime did I commit?
For what sin that I committed have you pursued me?
37 Now you have searched through all my possessions, and what did you find from
all these possessions that belongs to you? Put it here in front of my relatives and your
relatives, so that they can decide who is right, you or me!
miscarried/always given birth to animals safely►. I have not killed and eaten any
rams from your flocks.
39 When one of your animals was attacked and mauled/killed by a wild animal, I did
not bring it to you. I replaced the dead animal with a living one of my own animals.
Whenever one of your animals was stolen, during the day or during the night, you
demanded that I replace it with one of my own animals.
40 I suffered from the heat during the day and from the cold at night. I was often
not even able to sleep [PRS]!
41 I lived in your household for 20 years. I worked for you for 14 years to buy your
that time, you changed and reduced my wages many times [HYP].
42 If God, the one whom my grandfather Abraham worshiped and before whom my
father Isaac trembled in fear, had not been with me and helped me, you would have
sent me away ◄with nothing in my hands/owning nothing►! But God saw how much
I was suffering and how hard I was working, so last night he told you that what you
have done to me was wrong.”
GENESIS 31:43
52
GENESIS 32:5
Jacob and Laban made a solemn promise not to harm each other
43 Laban replied, “These two women are my daughters, and their children are my
grandchildren, and the animals are my animals. Everything you see here is mine

agreement, you and I, and do something that will remind us about our agreement.”
45 So Jacob took a large stone and set it on its end.
46 Then Jacob said to his relatives, “You also gather some stones.” So they gathered
some rocks and put them in a heap, and they ate some food there near the heap.
47 Laban gave the heap the Aramaic name Jegar-Sahadutha, which means ‘rock-pile
to remind us’, but Jacob gave the rock-pile the Hebrew name Galeed, which has the
same meaning.
48 Laban said to Jacob, “This pile of rocks we have put here today will help us to
remember our agreement.” That is why Jacob called it Galeed.
49 They also named the place Mizpah, which sounds like the Hebrew word that means
‘watchtower’, because Laban said, “We will ask Yahweh to watch you and me while
we are separated from each other, so that we do not try to harm each other.
50 If you mistreat my daughters, or if you take other women to be your wives, even
if no one tells me about it, don’t forget that God sees what you and I are doing!”
51 Laban also said to Jacob, “You see this large stone and this pile of rocks that we
have set up to be between us.
52 Both this pile of rocks and this large stone will remind us, that I will not go past
these rocks to harm you, and you will not go past these rocks to harm me.
53 We will ask the God whom your grandfather Abraham and his father Nahor
worshiped to punish [MTY] either one of us, if we harm the other one.”
So Jacob solemnly promised to do what they said in their peace agreement. And
he asked God, the one before whom his father Isaac trembled, to listen to what they
promised.
54 He offered a sacrifice to God there in the hilly area, and he invited his relatives
to eat with him. After they had eaten, they slept there that night.
55 The next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters goodbye and
asked God to bless them. Then he and his men left them and returned home.
32
Jacob sent gifts to Esau as he prepared to meet him
1 As Jacob and his family continued traveling, some angels, whom God sent, met
him.
2 When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is God’s army camp!” So he named that
place Mahanaim, which means ‘two camps’.
3 Jacob told some of the men to go ahead of him to his older brother Esau, who was
living in Seir, the land where the descendants of Edom lived.
4 He told them, “This is what I want you to say to Esau: 'I, Jacob, want to be your
servant and I want you to be my master. I have been living with our uncle Laban,
and I have stayed there until now.
5 I now own many cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats, and male and female slaves. Now
I am sending this message to you, sir, hoping that you will ◄be friendly toward me/
treat me kindly► when I arrive.’ “
GENESIS 32:6
53
GENESIS 32:23
6 The messengers went and gave that message to Esau.
When they returned to
Jacob, they said, “We went to your older brother Esau. Now he is coming to you, and
400 men are coming with him.”
7 Jacob was very afraid and worried. So he divided the people who were with him
into two groups. He also divided the sheep and goats, the cattle, and the camels, into
two groups.
8 He was thinking, “If Esau and his men come and attack us, perhaps one of the
groups will be left and will be able to escape.”
9 Then Jacob prayed, “O Yahweh God, whom my grandfather Abraham worshiped
and my father Isaac worships, you said to me, ‘Go back to your own land and to your
relatives, and I will ◄cause good things happen to/do good things for► you.’
10 I am not worthy for you to have been so kind and faithful to me in so many ways,
your servant. I had only this walking stick with me when I crossed the Jordan River
on my way to Haran, but now I am so wealthy that there are two large groups of my
family and possessions.
11 So now I pray that you will rescue me from [MTY] my older brother Esau, because
I am afraid that he and his men will come and attack and kill me and the children
and their mothers.
12 But do not forget that you have said, ‘I will certainly enable you to prosper, and I
will cause your descendants to be as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore,
which are so many that no one can count them.’ ”
13 Jacob slept there that night. The next morning he selected some animals to give
to his brother Esau.
14 He selected 200 female goats and 20 male goats, 200 female sheep and 20 male
sheep,
15 30 female camels and their offspring, 40 cows and ten bulls, 20 female donkeys
and 10 male donkeys.
16 He divided them into small herds, and put each herd into the care of one of his
servants. He said to his servants, “Go ahead of me, one group at a time, and keep
some space between each herd.”
17 He said to the servant who was going with the first group, “When my brother
Esau meets you, and he asks you, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going,
and to whom do these animals in front of you belong?’
18 tell him, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. He has sent them to you as a gift,
sir. And he is coming behind us.’ ”
19 He also said the same thing to the servants who were taking care of the second
and third groups, and to the other herdsmen. He said to them, “When you meet Esau,
I want you to say to him the same thing that I told the first servant.
20 And be sure to say ‘Jacob, who wants to serve you, is coming behind us.’ ” Jacob
told them to say that because he was thinking, “Perhaps these gifts that I am sending
ahead of me will cause him to ◄act peacefully toward/stop being angry with► me.
Then later, when I see him, perhaps he will be kind to me.”
21 So the men taking the gifts [PRS] went ahead, but Jacob himself stayed in the
camp that night.
Jacob wrestled with Yahweh
Jabbok River.
the river.
GENESIS 32:24
54
GENESIS 33:11
24 So Jacob was left there alone. But a man came and wrestled with him until dawn.
25 When the man realized that he was not winning against Jacob, he struck Jacob’s
hip and caused the thigh bone to pull away from the hip socket.
26 Then the man said, “Let me go, because it will soon be daylight.” Then Jacob
realized who he was really wrestling with. So he replied, “No, if you will not bless me,
I will not let you go!”
27 The man said to him, “What is your name?” He replied, “Jacob.”
28 The man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob. Your name will be Israel,
which means ‘he struggles with God’, because you have struggled with God and with
people, and you have won.”
29 Jacob said, “Now, please tell me your name!” The man replied, “◄Why do you
ask me what my name is?/You should not have to ask me what my name is!►” [RHQ]
But he blessed Jacob there.
30 So Jacob named the place Peniel, which means ‘God’s face’, saying “I looked
directly at God, but I did not die because of doing that.”
31 The sun was rising as Jacob left Peniel, and he was limping because of what had
happened to his hip.
32 The muscle on his hip joint had been injured. So to this present time, because
of what happened to Jacob, the Israeli people do not eat the muscle/tendon that is
attached to the socket of the hips of animals.
33
Jacob and Esau met peacefully
1 Then Jacob joined the rest of his family. Later that day
Jacob looked up and saw
so he separated the children. He put Leah’s children with Leah, Rachel’s children
2 He put the two female slaves and their children in front. He put Leah and her
children next. He put Rachel and Joseph at the rear.
3 He himself went ahead of them all, and as he continued to approach his older
brother, he prostrated himself with his face on the ground seven times.
4 But Esau ran to Jacob. He hugged him, put his arms around his neck, and kissed
him on the cheek. And they both cried.
5 Then Esau looked up and saw the women and the children. He asked, “Who are
these people who are with you?” Jacob replied, “These are the wives and children
that God has graciously/kindly given to me.”
6 Then the female slaves and their children came near and bowed in front of Esau.
7 Then Leah and her children came and bowed down. Finally Joseph and Rachel
came near and bowed down.
8 Esau asked, “What is the meaning of all the animals that I saw?” Jacob replied, “I
9 But Esau replied, “My younger brother, I have enough animals! Keep for yourself
10 But Jacob said, “No, please, if you feel good toward me, accept these gifts from
have forgiven me. It is like seeing the face of God!
11 Please accept these gifts that I have brought to you, because God has acted kindly
toward me, and I still have plenty of animals!” Jacob kept on urging him to accept
the animals, and finally he accepted them.
GENESIS 33:12
55
GENESIS 34:9
12 Then Esau said, “Let’s continue traveling together, and I will show the road to
you.”
13 Jacob had no intention to go with Esau, but he said, “You know, sir, that the
children are weak, and that I must take care of the female sheep and cows that are
◄sucking their mother’s milk/nursing their young►. If I force them to walk fast for
a long distance in just one day, the animals will all die.
14 You go ahead of me. I will lead the animals slowly, but I will walk as fast as the
children and animals can walk. I will catch up with you in Seir, in the land where the
descendants of Edom live.”
15 Esau said, “Then allow me to leave with you some of the men who came with
me, to protect you.” But Jacob replied, “◄Why do that?/There is no need to do that!►
[RHQ] The only thing that I want is for you to act friendly toward me.”
16 So on that day Esau left to return to Seir.
17 But instead of going to Seir, Jacob and his family went to a place called Succoth.
There he built a house for himself and his family, and built shelters for his livestock.
That is the reason they named the place Succoth, which means ‘shelters’.
18 Some time later, Jacob and his family left Paddan-Aram in Mesopotamia, and they
traveled safely to the Canaan region. There they set up their tents in a field near
Shechem city.
19 One of the leaders of the people in that area was named Hamor. Hamor had
several sons. Jacob paid the sons of Hamor 100 pieces of silver for the piece of ground
on which they set up their tents.
20 He built a stone altar there, and named it El-Elohe Israel, which means ‘God, the
God of Israel.’
34
Hamor’s son Shechem raped Jacob’s daughter Dinah
1 One day Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah, went to visit some of the women
in that area.
2 Shechem, one of the sons of Hamor, the ruler of that area who was descended
from the Hiv people-group, saw her. He wanted her. So he grabbed her and forced
her to have sex [EUP] with him.
3 He [SYN] was very much attracted to her, and fell in love with her, and he tried to
get her to love him.
4 So Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Please get this girl for me. I want her to
become my wife!”
5 Jacob very soon found out that his daughter Dinah had been disgraced/defiled.
returned home.
7 While they were still talking, Jacob’s sons came in from the field. When they found
out what had happened, they were shocked and very angry. They said, “Shechem has
done something that is very disgraceful among us Israeli people, something that never
should be done!”
8 But Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem really likes this girl. Please allow him
to marry her.
9 Let’s make an agreement: You will give your daughters to our young men to be

GENESIS 34:29
10 You can live among us, and live anywhere in our land that you wish.
You can
buy and sell things (OR, travel around) and if you find land that you want, then you
can buy it.”
11 Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers, “If you feel good toward me
and do what I am asking for, I will give you whatever you ask for.
12 Tell me what gifts you want and what bride price you want, and I will give you
what you ask for. I just want you to give the girl to me to be my wife.”
Dinah’s brothers got revenge
13 But because Shechem had done a shameful thing to their sister Dinah, the sons
of Jacob deceived Shechem and his father Hamor
14 by saying to them, “No, we cannot do that. We cannot give our sister to be the
wife of a man who is not circumcised, because that would be a shameful thing for us
to do.
15 We will do that only if you do one thing: You must become like us by circumcising
all the males that are among you.
16 Then we will give our daughters to your young men to be your wives, and we
will take your daughters to be the wives of our young men. We will live among you,
and we will become one people-group.
17 But if you will not agree to being circumcised, we will take our sister and go back
to our land.”
18 What they said pleased Hamor and his son Shechem.
19 Shechem was very much in love with Jacob’s daughter, so he quickly agreed to
do what they suggested.
20 Shechem went with Hamor to the meeting place near the city gate, and they
spoke to the city leaders, saying,
21 “These men are friendly toward us. We should let them live here and travel
around (OR, buy and sell things) and if they find land that they want, they can buy
it. There is plenty of land for them to live here. Our young men can marry their
daughters, and their young men can marry our daughters.
22 But these men will agree to live among us and become one people-group with us
23 But if we do that, just think! Their livestock and their possessions and their other
then they will live among us!”
who were there at the city gate agreed to what Hamor and Shechem suggested. So
every male in the city was circumcised.
25 On the third day after that, when the men of the city were still sore because of
being circumcised, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, who were Dinah’s brothers,
took their swords and entered the city without anyone opposing them, and killed all
the men.
26 They even killed Hamor and his son Shechem. Then they took Dinah out of
Shechem’s house and left the city.
27 Then the other sons of Jacob went into the city where all those dead bodies were.
They ◄looted/took everything in► the city to get revenge for the shameful thing that
had been done to their sister.
28 They took away the people’s sheep and goats, their cattle, their donkeys, and
everything else that they wanted from inside the city and from out in the countryside.
29 They took away everything that was valuable, even the children and the women.
They seized and took away everything that was in the houses.
GENESIS 34:30
57
GENESIS 35:16
30 Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have caused a lot of trouble for me!
Now the Canaan people-group and the Perizzi people-group and everyone else who
lives in this land will ◄hate me/say my name stinks►! I do not have many men to
fight for us, so if they all gather together and come to me and attack us, they will
destroy us and all our household!”
31 But they replied, “◄Should we have allowed Shechem to treat our sister like a
prostitute?/We could not just let Shechem treat our sister like a prostitute!►” [RHQ]
35
Jacob and his family returned to Bethel
1 Some time later God said to Jacob, “Go up to Bethel, and live there. Build an altar
to worship me, God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your older
brother Esau.”
2 So Jacob said to his household and to all the others who were with him, “Get rid
of the idols you brought from Mesopotamia. Also, bathe yourselves and put on clean
clothes.
3 Then we will get ready and go up to Bethel. There I will make an altar to worship
God. He is the one who helped me at the time when I was greatly distressed and
afraid, and he has been with me wherever I have gone.”
4 So they gave to Jacob all the idols that they had brought, and all their earrings.
Jacob buried them in the ground under the big oak tree that was near Shechem town.
5 As they prepared to leave there, God caused the people who lived in the cities
around them to be extremely afraid of Jacob’s family [PRS], so that they did not
pursue and attack them.
6 Jacob and all those who were with him came to Luz, which is now called Bethel,
7 There he built an altar. He named the place El-Bethel, which means ‘God of Bethel’,
his older brother Esau.
girl, was now very old. She died and was buried under an oak tree south of Bethel.
So they named that place Allon-Bacuth, which means ‘oak of weeping’.
9 After Jacob and his family returned from Paddan-Aram/Mesopotamia, while they
were still at Bethel, God appeared to Jacob again and blessed him.
10 God said to him again, “Your name will no longer be Jacob. It will be Israel.” So
Jacob was then called ‘Israel’.
11 Then God said to him, “I am God Almighty. Produce many children. Your
descendants will become many nations, and some of your descendants will be kings.

some wine and some olive oil on it to dedicate it to God.
15 Jacob named that place Bethel, which means ‘house of God’, because God had
spoken to him there.
Rachel died as Benjamin was born
16 Jacob and his family left Bethel and traveled south toward Ephrath town. When
they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to have severe childbirth
pains.
GENESIS 35:17
58
GENESIS 36:9
17 When her pain was the most severe, the ◄midwife/woman who helped her to
give birth► said to Rachel, “Do not be afraid, because now you have given birth to
another son!”
18 But she was dying, and with her last breath she said, “Name him Benoni,” which
means ‘son of my sorrow’, but his father named him Benjamin, which means ‘son of
my right hand’.
19 After Rachel died, she was buried alongside the road to Ephrath, which is now
called Bethlehem.
20 Jacob set up a large stone over her grave, and it is still there, showing where
Rachel’s grave is.
21 Jacob, whose new name was Israel, continued traveling with his family, and he
set up his tents on the south side of the watchtower at Eder town.
22 While they were living in that area, Jacob’s son Reuben had sex [EUP] with Bilhah,
one of his father’s ◄concubines/female slaves whom he had taken as a secondary
wife►. Someone told Jacob about it, and it made him very angry.
◄I will now give you/Here is► a list of Jacob’s twelve sons.
23 The sons of Leah were Reuben, who was Jacob’s oldest son, then Simeon, Levi,
Judah, Issachar and Zebulon.
24 The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.
25 The sons of Rachel’s female slave Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali.
26 The sons of Leah’s female slave Zilpah were Gad and Asher. All those sons of
Jacob, except Benjamin, were born while he was living in Paddan-Aram/Mesopotamia.
Isaac died
also lived there.
29 He was very old when he died, joining his ancestors who had died previously.
His sons Esau and Jacob buried his body.

The descendants of Esau
1 ◄Here is/I will now give you► a list of the descendants of Esau, whose other name
was Edom.
2 Esau married three women from the Canaan region: Adah, the daughter of
Elon from the Heth people-group; Oholibamah, who was the daughter of Anah and
granddaughter of Zibeon from the Hiv people-group;
3 and Basemath, who was the daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth.
4 Esau’s wife Adah gave birth to Eliphaz. Basemath gave birth to Reuel.
5 Oholibamah gave birth to Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. All these sons of Esau were
born while he was living in the Canaan region.
6-7 Jacob and Esau had very many possessions. The result was that they needed
more land for their livestock. The land where they were living was not big enough
for both of them. They had too much livestock. So Esau, whose other name was
Edom, had taken his wives and sons and daughters and all the other members of his
household, his sheep and goats and his other animals, and all the other things he had
obtained in Canaan land, and they had moved to an area that was away from Jacob.
8 They went to live in the Seir hilly area.
9 ◄Here is/I will now give you► another list of the male descendants of Esau. He
was the ancestor of the Edom people-group who live in the Seir area.

Joseph had two dreams about himself and his brothers
2 ◄This is/I will now tell you► what happened to Jacob’s family.
When his son Joseph was 17 years old, he was taking care of the flocks of sheep and
goats with some of his older brothers. They were sons of his father’s ◄concubines/
female slaves that he had taken to be his secondary wives►. Joseph sometimes told
his father about bad things that his brothers were doing.
3 Jacob loved Joseph more than he loved any of his other children, because Joseph
had been born when Jacob was an old man. Jacob made for Joseph a long pretty robe
that had long sleeves.
4 When Joseph’s older brothers realized that their father loved him more than he
loved any of them, they hated him. They never spoke kindly to him.
5 One night Joseph had a dream. He told his brothers about the dream.
6 He said to them, “Listen to the dream I had!
7 In the dream, we were tying up bundles of wheat in the field. Suddenly my
bundle stood up straight, and surprisingly, your bundles gathered around my bundle
and bowed down to it!”
8 His brothers said to him, “Do you think that some day you will rule over us? Are
you saying that some day you are going to be our king?” [RHQ] They hated him even
more than before because of what he had told them about his dream.
9 Later he had another dream, and again he told his older brothers about it. He
said, “Listen to this! I had another dream. In this dream, the sun and moon and
eleven stars were bowing down to me!”
10 He also told his father about it. His father rebuked him, saying “What are you
suggesting by that dream [RHQ]? Do you think it means that your mother and I and
your older brothers will some day bow down to the ground in front of you?” [RHQ]
11 Joseph’s older brothers were furious/angry with him, but his father just kept
thinking about what the dream meant.
12 One day Joseph’s older brothers went to take care of their father’s sheep and
goats that were eating grass near Shechem.
13 Some time later, Jacob said to Joseph, “Your brothers are taking care of the sheep
and goats near Shechem [RHQ]. I am going to send you there to see them.” Joseph
replied, “Okay.”
14 Jacob said, “Go and see if they are doing okay, and if the flocks are doing okay.
Then come back and give me a report.” So Jacob sent Joseph from the valley where
they were living, the valley where Hebron is located, to go north to find his brothers.
When Joseph arrived near Shechem city,
15 while he was wandering around in the fields looking/searching for his brothers,
a man saw him and asked him, “Whom are you looking/searching for?”
GENESIS 37:16
61
GENESIS 37:35
16 Joseph replied, “I am looking for my older brothers. Can you tell me where they
are taking care of their sheep and goats?”
17 The man replied, “They are not here any more. I heard one of them saying, ‘Let’s
take the sheep and goats and go to Dothan town.’ ”
Joseph was taken to Egypt after his brothers sold him.
So Joseph left there and went north, and found his older brothers near Dothan.
19 They said to each other things like, “Here comes that dreamer!”
Then we will tell people that a ferocious/wild animal attacked and killed him and ate
dreams do not come true►!”
21 Reuben heard what they were saying, so he tried to persuade them not to kill
[MTY] Joseph. He said, “No, we should not kill him.
22 Do not even shed his blood! We can throw him into this pit/cistern in the desert,
but we should not harm him [MTY].” He said that, and then left them, planning to
rescue Joseph later and take him back to his father.
23 So when Joseph arrived where his older brothers were, they seized him and
ripped off his pretty robe with long sleeves.
24 Then they took him and threw him into the pit/cistern. But the pit/cistern was
dry; there was no water in it.
25 After they sat down to eat some food, they looked up and saw a ◄caravan/group
of traders►, descendants of Ishmael, coming from the Gilead area. Their camels were
loaded with bags of spices and nice-smelling resins. They were going down to Egypt
to sell those things there.
26 Judah said to his older and younger brothers, “If we kill our younger brother and
hide his body, ◄what will we gain?/we will not gain anything!► [RHQ]
27 So, instead of harming him, let’s sell him to these men who are descendants of
Ishmael. Don’t forget, he is our own younger brother!” So they all agreed to do that.
28 When those traders from the Midian area came near, Joseph’s brothers pulled
him up out of the pit/cistern. Then they sold him to the men from Midian for 20
pieces of silver. The traders then took Joseph to Egypt.
29 When Reuben returned to the pit/cistern, he saw that his younger brother was
not there. He was so grieved that he tore his clothes.
30 He went back to his younger brothers and said, “The boy is not in the pit/cistern!
What can I do now?” [RHQ]
31 Joseph’s brothers did not dare to tell their father what they had done. So, they
decided to invent a story about what had happened. They got Joseph’s robe. Then they
killed a goat and dipped the robe in the goat’s blood.
32 They took that pretty robe back to their father and said, “We found this robe!
Look at it. Is it your son’s robe?”
33 He recognized it, and he said, “Yes, it is my son’s robe! Some ferocious/wild
animal must have attacked and killed him! I am sure that the animal has torn Joseph
to pieces!”
34 Jacob was so grieved that he tore his clothes. He put on ◄sackcloth/clothes that
people wear when they are mourning for someone who has died►. He mourned/
cried for his son for many days.
35 All of his children came to try to comfort him, but he did not pay attention to
what they said. He said, “No, I will still be mourning/crying when I die and go to be
GENESIS 37:36
62
GENESIS 38:16
with my son.” So Joseph’s father continued to cry because of what had happened to
his son.
36 In the meantime, the men/traders from Midian took Joseph to Egypt and sold him
to Potiphar, who was one of the king’s officials. He was the captain of the soldiers
who protected the king.
38
2 There he ◄met/became acquainted with► a woman who was the daughter of a
man from Canaan named Shua. He married her. He had sex [EUP] with her,
3 and she became pregnant and later gave birth to a son, whom he named Er.
4 Later she became pregnant again and gave birth to another son whom she named
Onan.
5 Many years later, when Judah and his family went to live in Kezib town, Judah’s
wife gave birth to another son, whom she named Shelah.
6 When Judah’s oldest son Er grew up, Judah got a wife for him, a woman named
Tamar.
7 But Er did something that Yahweh considered to be very wicked, so Yahweh caused
him to die.
8 Then Judah said to Onan, “Your older brother died without having any sons. So
marry his widow and have sex [EUP] with her. That is what our customs require that
you should do.”
9 But Onan knew if he did that, any children who would be born would not be
considered to be his. So every time he had sex [EUP] with his brother’s widow, he
spilled his semen on the ground, so that she would not get pregnant and produce
children for his older brother.
10 Yahweh considered that what he did was wicked, so he caused him to die also.
11 Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Return to your father’s house,
but do not marry anyone else. When my youngest son Shelah grows up, he can marry
you.” But Judah really did not want Shelah to marry her, because he was afraid that
then Shelah would die too, just as his older brothers had died. So Tamar obeyed Judah
and went back to live in her father’s house again.
12 Several years later, Judah’s wife, who was the daughter of Shua, died. When
the time of mourning for her was finished, Judah decided to go up to Timnah, to
the place where his ◄men were shearing his sheep/sheep were being sheared► His
friend Hiram, from Adullam, went with him.
13 Someone said to Tamar, “Your father-in-law is going to the fields near the city of
Timnah to help the men who are shearing his sheep.”
14 She realized that now Shelah was grown up, but Judah had not given her to him
to be his wife. So she took off her widow’s clothes, and covered her head with a veil,
so that people would not ◄recognize her/know who she was►. Then she sat down at
the entrance to Enaim town, which is on the road to Timnah.
15 When Judah came along and saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute,
because she had covered her head like prostitutes often did (OR, and sat where
prostitutes often sat).
16 Judah did not realize that she was his daughter-in-law. So he said to her, “Hey,
let me have sex [EUP] with you!” She replied, “What will you give me for allowing
you to have sex [EUP] with me?”
GENESIS 38:17
63
GENESIS 39:4
17 He replied, “I will send you a young goat from my flock of goats.”
She asked,
18 He replied, “What do you want me to give to you?” She replied, “Give me the
ring that has your name on it that is tied by a cord around your neck, and give me
the walking stick that you are holding in your hand.” So he gave them to her. Then
he had sex [EUP] with her, and she became pregnant.
19 After she left, she took off the veil and put her widow’s clothes on again.
20 Judah gave a young goat to his friend from Adullam, for him to take back to the
woman, as he had promised. But his friend could not find the woman.
21 So he asked the men who lived there, “Where is the prostitute who was sitting
by the road at Enaim?” They replied, “There has never been a prostitute here!”
22 So he went back to Judah and said, “I did not find her. Furthermore, the men
who live in that town said, ‘There has never been a prostitute here.’ ”
23 Judah said, “She can keep the things that I gave to her. If we continued to search
for her, people would ridicule us. I tried to send this young goat to her, but you could
not find her to give it to her.”
24 About three months later, someone told Judah, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has
become a prostitute and now she is pregnant!” Judah said, “Drag her outside of the
city and kill her by burning her!”
25 But as they were taking her outside of the city, she gave the ring and walking
stick to someone, and told him to take them to Judah, and say to him, “The man who
owns these things is the one who caused me to become pregnant.” She also said to
tell him, “Look at this ring, and the cord that is attached to it, and this walking stick.
Whose are they?”
26 When the man did that, Judah recognized the ring and the stick. He said, “She
is more righteous than I am. I did not tell my son Shelah to marry her, as I promised
that I would.” And Judah did not have sex [EUP] with her again.
27 When it was time for her to give birth, she was surprised that there were twin
boys in her womb.
28 As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand. So the midwife fastened
a scarlet thread around his wrist, saying, “This one came out first.”
29 But he pulled his hand back inside the womb, and his brother came out first. So
she said, “So this is how you break your way out first!” So she named him Perez,
which sounds like the Hebrew word that means ‘breaking out.’
30 Then his younger brother, the one who had the scarlet thread around his wrist,
came out. And he was named Zerah, which sounds like the Hebrew word that means
‘redness of dawn.’
39
In Egypt, Joseph refused to have sex with Potiphar’s wife
1 Meanwhile, the descendants of Ishmael took Joseph down to Egypt. There Potiphar
bought Joseph from them. Potiphar was an Egyptian who was one of the king’s
officials and the captain of the king’s ◄palace guards/guards who protected the king►.
2 Because Yahweh helped Joseph, he was able to do his work very well, and lived
in the house of his Egyptian master.
3 His master saw that Yahweh was helping Joseph and enabling him to be successful
in everything that he did.
4 Joseph’s master was pleased with him, so he appointed him to be his personal
servant. Then he appointed him to be the one who would take care of everything in
household and all that he owned, Yahweh blessed the people who lived in Potiphar’s
house because of Joseph. He also caused Potiphar’s crops to grow well.
6 Potiphar allowed Joseph to take care of everything that he owned. Potiphar
needed to decide only about the food he ate. He was not concerned about anything
else in his house.
Joseph was well-built/muscular and handsome.
7 Because of that, after a while, his master’s wife started to look fondly at Joseph.
So one day she said to him, “Have sex [EUP] with me!”
8 But he refused, saying to his master’s wife, “Listen! My master is not concerned
about anything in this house. He has appointed me to take care of everything that he
owns.
9 No one in this household has more authority than I do. The only thing that he
has not allowed me to have is you, because you are his wife! So ◄how could I do
this wicked thing that you are asking me to do?/I certainly could not do this wicked
thing!► [RHQ] I would be sinning against God if I did that!”
10 She kept on asking Joseph day after day to have sex [EUP] with her, but he refused.
He would not even go near her.
To get revenge, Potiphar’s wife lied, and Potiphar had Joseph thrown into prison
and none of the other
household servants were in the house.
12 Potiphar’s wife grabbed his cloak and said, “Have sex [EUP] with me!” Joseph
ran out of the house, but his cloak was still in her hand!
13 When she saw that he had run outside leaving his cloak in her hand,
14 she called the household servants. She said to them, “Look! This Hebrew man
that my husband brought to us is ◄insulting/trying to do something disgraceful to►
us! He came into my room and tried to ◄rape me/make me have sex [EUP] with
him►, but I screamed loudly.
15 As soon as he heard me scream loudly, he left his loincloth with me and ran
outside!”
16 She kept the loincloth beside her until her husband, Joseph’s master, came home.
17 Then she told him this story: “That Hebrew slave whom you brought here came
into my room and tried to rape me!
18 As soon as I screamed loudly, he ran outside, leaving me holding his loincloth!”
19 When Joseph’s master heard this story that his wife told him, saying “This is how
your slave treated me,” he was very angry.
20 Joseph’s master took Joseph and put him in prison, the place where all the king’s
prisoners were put, and Joseph stayed there.
21 But Yahweh was kind to Joseph and helped him, and caused the ◄prison warden/
man who was in charge of the prison► to be pleased with him.
22 So the prison warden put Joseph in charge of all those who were in the prison,
and in charge of all the work that was done there.
23 The warden was not concerned with anything that Joseph was taking care of,
because Yahweh helped Joseph to do well everything that he did.
11 One day Joseph went into the house to do his work,
40
Joseph told two other prisoners the meaning of their dreams
1 Some time later, two of the king of Egypt’s officials did things that displeased him.
One was his chief ◄drink-server/man who prepared the wine and served it to the
king►, and the other was his chief ◄baker/man who baked bread for the king►.
GENESIS 40:2
65
GENESIS 40:22
2 The king became angry with both of them.
3 So he had them put in prison, in the house of the captain of the palace guards.
That was the place where Joseph was being kept.
4 The two men were in prison for a long time. And during that time the captain of
the palace guards appointed Joseph to be their servant, to take care of their needs.
5 One night while the king’s drink-server and his baker were there in the prison,
each of them had a dream. Each dream had a different meaning.
6 The next morning, when Joseph came to them, he saw that both of them were
dejected/worried.
7 So he asked them, “Why do you look so sad today?”
8 One of them answered, “We both had dreams last night, but there is no one who
can tell us the meaning of the dreams.” Joseph said to them, “God is the only one
who can [RHQ] tell the meaning of dreams. So tell me what you dreamed, and God
will tell me the meaning.”
9 So the king’s chief drink-server told his dream to Joseph. He said, “In my dream
I saw a grapevine in front of me.
10 On the vine there were three branches.
After the branches budded, they
blossomed, and then they produced clusters of grapes.
11 I was holding the king’s cup, so I took the grapes and squeezed the juice into the
cup. Then I gave the cup to the king to drink the juice.”
12 God immediately told Joseph what the dream meant. So Joseph said to him, “This
13 Within three days the king will release you from prison. He will let you do the
when you were his drink-server.
forget me.
15 People took me away forcefully from the land where my fellow Hebrews live.
I did nothing wrong there, and also while I have been here in Egypt, I have done
nothing for which I deserved to be put in prison. So be kind to me and tell the king
about me, so that he will release me from this prison!”
16 When the chief baker heard that the meaning of the dream of the king’s drinkserver was very favorable, he said to Joseph, “I also had a dream. In the dream I was
surprised to see three baskets of bread stacked on my head.
17 In the top basket there were many kinds of baked goods for the king, but birds
were eating them from the top basket that was on my head!”
18 God again told Joseph what the dream meant, so he said, “The three baskets also
represent three days.
19 Within three days the king will command that your head be cut off. Then your
body will be hung on a tree, and vultures will come and eat your flesh.”
20 The third day after that was the ◄king’s birthday/day they celebrated when the
king became one year older►. On that day the king invited all his officials to celebrate
his birthday. During the celebration, while they were all gathered there, the king
summoned his chief drink-server and chief baker from the prison.
21 He said that his chief drink-server could have his previous job again, so that
again he took cups of wine to the king.
22 But he commanded that the chief baker should be killed by being hanged, just
as Joseph had said would happen when he told the two men the meaning of their
dreams.
GENESIS 40:23
66
GENESIS 41:18
23 But the chief drink-server did not think about Joseph. He forgot to do what Joseph
asked him to do.
41
Joseph told the king that the meaning of his dreams was that there would be a big
famine
1 Two complete years later, the king of Egypt had a dream. In the dream, he was
standing alongside the Nile River.
2 Suddenly seven healthy fat cows come up out of the river. They started eating the
grass that was on the riverbank.
3 Soon seven other cows, unhealthy-looking and thin, came up behind them from
the Nile River. They stood alongside the fat cows that were on the riverbank.
4 Then the unhealthy thin cows ate the seven healthy fat cows. And then the king
woke up.
5 The king went to sleep again, and he had another dream. This time he saw seven
heads of grain that were full of kernels of grain and ripe, and all growing on one
stalk.
6 After that, the king saw that seven other heads of grain sprouted on that (OR, on
7 Then the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven ripe full heads. Then the
8 But the next morning he was worried about the meaning of the dream. So he
summoned all the magicians and wise men who lived in Egypt. He told them what
he had dreamed, but none of them could tell him the meaning of the two dreams.
9 Then the chief drink-server said to the king, “Now I remember something that I
should have told you! I made a mistake by forgetting to tell it to you.
10 One time you were angry with two of us. So you put me and the chief baker in
the prison in the house of the captain of the palace guards.
11 While we were there, one night each of us had a dream, and the dreams had
different meanings.
12 There was a young Hebrew man there with us. He was a servant of the captain
of the palace guards. We told him what we had dreamed, and he told us what our
dreams meant. He told each of us the meaning of our dreams.
13 And what happened was exactly the same as the meanings that he told us: You
said I could have my previous job again, but the other man was killed by being
hanged. The Hebrew man’s name was Joseph.”
14 When the king heard that, he told some servants to bring Joseph to him, and they
quickly brought Joseph out of the prison. Joseph shaved and put on better clothes,
and then he went and stood in front of the king.
15 The king said to Joseph, “I had two dreams, and no one can tell me what they
mean. But someone told me that when you hear someone tell about a dream he has
had, you can tell that person what the dream means.”
16 But Joseph replied to the king, “No, I cannot do that. It is God who knows the
meaning of dreams, but he will enable me to tell you their meaning, and they will
mean something good.”
17 The king said to Joseph, “In my first dream I was standing on the bank of the
Nile River.
18 Suddenly seven healthy fat cows came up out of the river, and they started eating
the grass that was on the riverbank.
GENESIS 41:19
67
GENESIS 41:39
19 Soon seven other cows, ugly and thin ones, came up behind them from the river.
I never saw such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt!
20 The thin ugly cows ate the seven fat cows that came up first.
21 But afterwards, no one would have known that the thin cows ate them, because
they were just as ugly as they were before. Then I woke up.
22 Then I had another dream. I saw seven heads of grain. They were full of kernels
of grain and ripe, and they were all growing on one stalk.
23 Then to my surprise I saw seven other heads of grain that sprouted. They were
thin and had been dried up by the hot east wind.
24 The thin heads of grain swallowed the seven good heads. I told these dreams to
the magicians, but none of them could explain to me what they meant.”
25 Then Joseph said to the king, “Both your dreams have the same meaning. God is
revealing to you in your dreams what he is about to do.
26 The seven healthy cows represent seven years. The seven good heads of grain
27 The seven thin ugly cows that came up behind them and the seven worthless

is about to do.
land of Egypt,
30 but after that there will be seven years ◄of famine/when food will be very
scarce►. Then people will forget all the years when there was plenty of food, because
the famine that will come afterward will ruin the country.
31 The people will forget how plentiful food was previously, because the famine will
be very terrible.
32 The reason God gave to you two dreams is that he wants you to know that this
will happen, and he will cause it to happen very soon.
33 “Now I suggest that you should choose a man who is wise and can make good
decisions. I suggest that you appoint him to direct the affairs of the whole country.
34 You should also appoint supervisors over the country, in order that they can
arrange to collect one-fifth of all the grain that is harvested during the seven years
when food is plentiful.
35 They should collect this amount of grain during those seven years that are
coming, when there will be plenty of food. You should supervise them as they store
it in the cities.
36 This grain should be stored so that it can be eaten during the seven years when
there will be a famine here in Egypt, so that the people in this country will not die
from hunger.”
The king made Joseph the governor of all of Egypt, to handle the problem of the
famine
37 The king and his officials thought that this would be a good plan.
38 So the king said to them, “◄Can we find any other man like Joseph, a man to
whom God has given his Spirit?/It is not likely that we will find another man like this
man, one to whom God has given his Spirit!►” [RHQ]
39 Then the king said to Joseph, “Because God has revealed all this to you, it seems
to me that there is no one who is as wise as you and who can decide wisely about
things.
GENESIS 41:40
68
GENESIS 41:57
40 So I will put you in charge of everything in my palace.
All the people here in
Egypt must obey what you command. Only because I am king [MTY] will I have more
authority than you.”
41 Then the king said to Joseph, “I am now putting you in charge of the whole
country of Egypt.”
42 The king took from his finger the ring that had his seal on it, and he put it on
Joseph’s finger. He put robes made of fine linen on him, and he put a gold chain
around his neck.
43 Then he arranged for Joseph to ride around in the chariot that showed that he
was the second-most important man in the country. When Joseph rode in the chariot,
men shouted to the people who were on the road in front of him, “Get off the road!”
So the king put Joseph in charge of everything in the country.
44 The king said to Joseph, “I am the king, but no one in the whole land of Egypt
will do anything [IDM] if you do not permit them to do it.”
45 The king gave Joseph a new name, Zaphenath-Paneah. He also gave him Asenath
to be his wife. She was the daughter of Potiphera, who was a priest in a temple in
On city. Then Joseph became known (OR, traveled) through all the land of Egypt.
46 Joseph was 30 years old when he started to work for the king of Egypt. To do his
work, he left the king’s palace and traveled throughout Egypt.
47 During the next seven years, the land produced abundant crops, so there was
plenty of food.
48 As Joseph supervised them, his helpers collected one-fifth of all the grain that
was produced during those years, and stored it in the cities. In each city, he had his
helpers store up the grain that was grown in the fields that surrounded that city.
49 Joseph had them store up a huge amount of grain. It looked as plentiful as the
sand on the seashore. There was so much grain that after a while they stopped
keeping records of how much grain was stored, because there was more grain than
they could measure.
50 Before the seven years of famine started, Joseph’s wife Asenath gave birth to two
sons.
51 Joseph named the first one Manasseh, which sounds like the Hebrew word that
means ‘forget’, because, he said, “God has caused me to forget all my troubles and all
my father’s family.”
52 He named his second son Ephraim, which means ‘to have children’, because, he
said, “God has given me children here in this land where I have suffered.”
53 Finally the seven years in which there was plenty of food ended.
54 Then the seven years of famine started, just as Joseph had predicted. There was
also a famine in all the other nearby lands, but although the crops did not grow, there
was food everywhere in Egypt, because of the grain they had stored up in the cities.
55 When all the people of [MTY] Egypt had eaten all of their own food and were
still hungry, they begged the king for food. So the king told all the people of Egypt,
“Go to Joseph, and do what he tells you to do.”
the people of Egypt, because the famine was very severe all over Egypt.
Joseph, because the famine was very severe everywhere [HYP].

from their brother
1 When someone told Jacob that there was grain in Egypt that people could buy, he
said to his sons, “◄Why do you just sit there looking at each other?/Do not just sit
there looking at each other!► [RHQ] We need some grain!”
2 He said to them, “Someone told me that there is grain for sale in Egypt. Go down
there and buy some for us, in order that we will not die!”
3 So Joseph’s ten older brothers went down to Egypt to buy some grain.
4 But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s younger brother, to go with the others,
because he was afraid/worried that something terrible might happen to him like what
happened to Joseph.
5 So Jacob’s other sons went down from Canaan to Egypt to buy grain, and others
from there went too, because there was a famine in Canaan also.
6 At that time Joseph was the governor of Egypt. He was the one who sold grain to
people who came from all over Egypt and from many other countries [HYP] to buy
grain. So when Joseph’s brothers arrived, they were told that it was necessary for
them to talk with Joseph. So they went to him and prostrated themselves before him
with their faces to the ground.
7 As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them. But he pretended that he
did not know them. He spoke harshly to them, saying, “Where do you come from?”
One of them replied, “We have come from Canaan, to buy some grain.”
8 Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him.
9 And then Joseph remembered what he had dreamed about them many years
previously. But he decided not to tell them yet that he was their younger brother. He
said to them, “You are spies! You have come to find out whether we will be able to
defend ourselves if you attack us!”
10 One of them replied, “No, sir! We have come to buy grain.
11 We are all sons of one man. We are honest men, not spies.”
12 He said to them, “I do not believe you. You have come just to see whether we
would be able to defend ourselves if we were attacked!”
13 But one of them replied, “No, that is not true! Originally there were twelve of
us who were brothers, the sons of one man. Our younger brother is with our father.
One younger brother has died. [EUP]”
14 Joseph replied, “You are lying! I think it is just as I told you. You are spies!
15 But this is how I will determine whether what you are saying is true. I think that
as surely as the king lives, you are spies. And you will not leave this place until your
youngest brother comes here!
16 Send one of your group to go and get your younger brother and bring him here.
I will put the rest of you in prison, in order that I may test what you have said to find
younger brother here, then, just as surely as the king lives, it will be clear that you
17 Then Joseph put them all in prison for three days.
18 On the third day, Joseph went to the prison and said to them, “I am a man who
fears that God will punish me if I do not do what I promise. So do what I tell you, and
I will spare your lives.
19 If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison, and the rest
of you can take some grain back to your families who are very hungry because of the
famine.
GENESIS 42:20
70
GENESIS 42:34
20 But if you come back here again, you must bring your youngest brother to me,
so that you can prove that what you told me is true, and as a result I will not have
you executed.” So they agreed to do that.
21 They said to each other, “It is surely because of what we did to our younger
brother that ◄we are being punished/God is punishing us►! We saw that he [SYN]
was very distressed when he pleaded with us not to harm him. But we did not pay
any attention to him, and that is why we are having this trouble!”
22 Reuben said to them, “I told you not to harm the boy [RHQ], but you did not pay
attention to what I said! Now we are being ◄paid back/punished► for killing him
[MTY]!”
23 While they were talking with Joseph, they were speaking through ◄an
interpreter/someone who knew their language and the Egyptian language►, but when
they said these things among themselves, they were speaking in their own language,
and they did not know that Joseph could understand their language, and that he could
understand what they were saying.
24 Because of what they said, Joseph realized that they admitted that what they had
done to him many years previously was wrong. He could not keep from crying, and
he did not want them to see him crying, so he left them and went outside the room
and began to cry. But then he returned to them and talked to them again. Then he
took Simeon, and while they were watching, he told his servants to tie him up. He
left Simeon in the prison and told the others that they could go.
25 Joseph told his servants to fill the men’s sacks with grain, but he also told them
to put the money that each one had paid for the grain in the top of his sack. He also
told them to give them food to eat along the way. After the servants did those things
for Joseph’s older brothers,
26 his older brothers loaded the sacks of grain on their donkeys and left.
Joseph’s brothers returned home, frightened because the money they paid was in
their sacks
27 At the place where they stopped to sleep that night, one of them opened his sack
to get some grain for his donkey. He was amazed to see his money in the top of the
sack.
28 He exclaimed to his brothers, “Someone has returned my money! Here it is in
my sack!” They started shaking with fear, and said to each other, “What is this that
29 When they returned to their father in Canaan land, they told him all that had
30 “The man who governs the whole land of Egypt talked very harshly to us. He
acted toward us as though we were spying on his country.
31 But we told him, ‘We are honest men! We are not spies.
32 Originally there were twelve of us who were brothers, the sons of one father.
One has died [EUP], and our youngest brother is with our father in Canaan.’
33 The man who is the governor of the land did not believe us, so he said to us, ‘This
is how I will know if you are truly honest men: Leave one of your brothers here with
me. Then the rest of you can take some grain for your families that are starving from
hunger and go.
34 But when you return, bring your youngest brother to me, in order that I will know
that you are not spies, but instead, that you are honest men. Then I will release your
brother for you. And then you can buy whatever you want in this country.’ ”
GENESIS 42:35
71
GENESIS 43:13
35 As they were emptying their sacks, they were surprised that in each man’s sack
was his pouch of money! When they and their father saw all the pouches of money,
they were frightened.
36 Their father Jacob said to them, “You have caused two of my children to be taken
from me! Joseph is dead, and Simeon is gone! And now you want to take Benjamin
from me! It is I who am suffering because of all these things that are happening!”
37 Reuben said to his father, “I will be responsible for Benjamin. I will take him to
Egypt and bring him back to you. Let me take care of him. If I do not bring Benjamin
back to you, you may kill both of my sons.”
38 But Jacob said, “No, I will not let my son go down there with you. His older brother
is dead, and he is the only one of my wife Rachel’s sons who is left! If something
harms him while you are traveling, you would cause me, a gray-haired old man, to
die because of sorrow.”
43
Joseph’s brothers returned to Egypt with Benjamin, to buy more grain
1 The famine in Canaan got worse.
2 Finally, when Jacob and his family had eaten all the grain they had brought from
Egypt, Jacob said to them, “Go back to Egypt and buy some more grain for us!”
3 But Judah said to him, “The man who sold us the grain warned us sternly, ‘I will
not let you see me [SYN] again if you come and your younger brother is not with
you.’
4 So, if you will send our younger brother with us, we will go down to Egypt and
buy some grain for you.
5 But if you will not send him, we will not go down there, because that man said to
us, ‘I will not let you see me again if your younger brother is not with you.’ ”
6 Jacob asked, “Why did you cause me to have this trouble by telling the man that
you had a younger brother?”
7 One of them replied, “The man asked about us and about our family. He said,
questions. ◄We could not know that he would say, ‘The next time that you come
‘The next time that you come down here, bring your brother with you!’►” [RHQ]
immediately, in order that we and you and our children may get grain and not die
from hunger.
9 I myself will guarantee that he will return. You can require me to do what I am
promising [IDM]. If I do not bring him back to you safely, you can say forever that ◄I
am to blame/it was my fault that he did not return to you►.
10 If we had not ◄wasted so much time/waited so long►, by now we could have
gone there and returned two times!”
11 Then their father Jacob said to them, “If there is no other way, do this: Put in your
sacks some of the best things that are grown in this land, and take them down to the
man as a gift. Take some balm/perfume and honey and spices and myrrh/ointment,
some pistachio nuts, and almonds.
12 Take twice as much money as you took the previous time, because you must
return the silver that someone put in the tops of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake
that it was put in your sacks.
13 Take your younger brother and go back to that man.
GENESIS 43:14
72
GENESIS 43:32
14 I will pray that God Almighty will cause that man to act mercifully toward you,
so that he will let your other brother, as well as Benjamin, come back here with you.
But as for me, if my sons are taken from me, then I will not have my sons!”
15 So the men took the gifts that Jacob said that they should take, and twice the
amount of money that the grain would cost, and they also took Benjamin. They went
down quickly to Egypt, and they stood in front of Joseph.
16 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the man who ◄was in charge of/
supervised► things in his house, “Take these men to my house. Slaughter an animal
and prepare a meal, because I want them to eat with me at noon.” And he told him
in what order they were to be seated.
17 The man did as Joseph said. And he took them to Joseph’s house.
18 But they were afraid because he was taking them to Joseph’s house. They were
thinking, “He is taking us here because of the silver that was put in our sacks the first
time that we came here. While we are eating, he will have his servants attack us and
seize us and cause us to become his slaves, and also take our donkeys.”
Joseph made a feast for his brothers, but they still did not recognize him
19 They went with the man who was in charge of things in Joseph’s house. When
they arrived at the entrance of the house,
20 one of them said to him, “Please, sir, listen to me. We came down here previously
and bought some grain.
21 But at the place where we stopped for the night as we were returning home, we
opened our sacks. We were astonished to see that in the top of each of our sacks was
the exact amount of silver that we had paid for the grain! So we have brought it back
with us.
22 We have also brought more silver with us to buy more grain. We do not know
23 The man replied, “Relax! Do not worry about it! I received the silver that you

and gave them food for the donkeys.
prepared their gifts to give to Joseph when he arrived.
26 When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts that they had brought
into the house. Then they bowed down to the ground in front of him.
27 He asked them if they were ◄well/in good health►, and then he asked, “How is
the health of your old father, the one that you told me about? Is he still living?”
28 One of them replied, “Yes, our father, who is willing to be your servant, is still
alive, and he is well.” Then again they bowed down in front of him.
29 Then he saw his younger brother Benjamin, his own mother’s other son. He
asked them, “Is this your youngest brother, the one whom you told me about?” After
they said “Yes,” he said to Benjamin, “Young man, I pray that God will act kindly
toward you.”
30 Joseph quickly left the room. He realized that he was about to cry because he
◄was full of emotion about his younger brother/loved his younger brother so much►.
He went into his private room and cried there.
31 Then, after he washed the tears from his face, he came out, and controlling his
emotions, he said to the servants, “Serve the food!”
32 The people of Egypt considered that it was disgraceful for them to eat with
Hebrews, so the servants served food to Joseph by himself, and served the other

their ages, from the oldest to the youngest!
Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as anyone else’s portion! So they ate
44
Joseph tricked his brothers by having his cup put in Benjamin’s sack
1 When his brothers were ready to return home, Joseph said to the man who was
in charge of things in his house, “Fill the sacks of those men with as much grain as
they can carry on their donkeys. And put in the top of each man’s sack the silver that
he paid for the grain.
2 Then put my silver cup in the top of the youngest brother’s sack, along with the
silver that he paid for the grain.” So the servant did what Joseph told him to do.
3 The next morning at dawn the men started on the way home with their donkeys.
4 When they had not gone far from the city, Joseph said to the servant in charge of
things in his house, “Pursue those men immediately. When you catch up to them, say
to them, ‘We did good things for you! Why have you paid us back by doing something
bad to us?
5 You have stolen the cup that my master drinks from [RHQ]! It is the cup that he
uses to find out things that nobody knows! What you did was very wicked!’ ”
6 The servant left immediately and when he caught up with them, he told them what
Joseph had told him to say.
7 But one of them replied to him, “Sir, why do you say such things? We are your
servants, and we would never do anything like that!
8 We even brought back to you from Canaan land the silver that we found inside the
tops of our sacks! So ◄we certainly would not steal silver or gold from your master’s
house!/Why would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house?► [RHQ]
9 If you discover that any of us has that cup, you can execute him, and the rest of
us will become your slaves.”
10 The man replied, “Okay, I will do what you say. But the one who has the cup will
not be executed. Instead, he will become my slave, and the rest of you may return
home.”
11 Each of the men quickly lowered his sack down from the donkey to the ground
and opened it.
12 Then the servant started to search for the cup in each sack. He started with the
oldest brother’s sack and ended with the youngest one’s sack. And he found the cup
in Benjamin’s sack and showed it to them.
13 The brothers tore their clothes because they were so dismayed. They loaded the
sacks on the donkeys again and returned to the city.
Back in Egypt, Joseph said that only the one who stole his cup would be his slave
14 When Judah and his older and younger brothers entered Joseph’s house, Joseph
was still there. The servant told Joseph what had happened. Then the brothers threw
15 He said to them, “Why did you do this? Do you not know that a man like me can
find out things that nobody knows?” [RHQ]
GENESIS 44:16
74
GENESIS 45:1
16 Judah replied, “Sir, what can we say? How can we prove that we ◄are innocent/
did not steal the cup►? God has ◄paid us back/punished us► for the sins we committed
many years ago. So now we will become your slaves—both we and the one in whose
sack the cup was found.”
17 But Joseph replied, “No, I could never do anything like that. Only the man in
whose sack the cup was found will become my slave. The rest of you can return to
your father peacefully.”
Judah pleaded that he be allowed to become Joseph’s slave instead of Benjamin
18 Then Judah came near to Joseph and said, “Sir, please let me say something to
you. You are equal to the king himself, so you could command that I be executed; but
do not be angry with me for speaking to you.
19 You asked us, ‘Is your father still living, and do you have another brother?’
20 We answered, ‘Our father is alive, but he is an old man. He has a young son who
was born after our father became an old man. That son had an older brother, who is
and his father loves him very much.’
down to me, so that I can see him.’
22 We said to you, ‘No, we cannot do that, because the boy cannot leave his father.
If he leaves his father, his father will die from sorrow.’
23 But you told us, ‘If your youngest brother does not come back with you, I will
not let you see me again!’
24 When we returned to our father, we told him what you said.
25 Months later our father said, ‘Go back to Egypt and buy some more grain!’
26 But we said, ‘We cannot go back by ourselves. We will go only if our youngest
brother is with us. We will not be able to see the man who sells grain if our youngest
brother is not with us.’
27 Our father replied, ‘You know that my wife Rachel gave birth to two sons for me.
28 One of them disappeared, and I said, “A wild animal has surely torn him to
pieces.” And I have not seen him since then.
29 I am an old gray-haired man. If you take this other one from me, too, and
something harms him, you would cause me to die because of my sorrow.’
30 “So please listen. My father will remain alive only if his youngest son remains
alive.
31 If he sees that the boy is not with us when we return to him, he will die. We will
cause our gray-haired father to die because of his sorrow.
32 I guaranteed/promised to my father that the boy would return safely. I told him,
‘You can require me to do what I am promising. If I do not bring him back to you,
you can say forever that ◄I am to blame/it is my fault► for not bringing him back to
you.’
33 “So, please let me remain here as your slave instead of my youngest brother, and

Joseph told his brothers who he was
1 Joseph was not able to control his feelings any longer. He did not want to cry in
front of his servants, so he said to them loudly, “All of you go outside!” After they

75
GENESIS 45:21
went outside, there was no one else there with Joseph when he told his brothers who
he was.
2 He cried so loudly that the people of Egypt who were outside heard it, and even
the people in the king’s palace heard it.
3 Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is our father still alive?” But his brothers
were not able to reply, because they were frightened because of what he said.
4 Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Come close to me!” When they came closer, he
said, “I am your brother Joseph! I am the one you sold to traders who brought me
here to Egypt!
5 But now, do not be distressed, and do not be angry with yourselves for having sold

his palace and the governor of everyone in Egypt!
9 Now return to my father quickly, and say to him, ‘This is what your son Joseph
says: “God has caused me to become the governor over the whole land of Egypt.
Come down to me immediately!
10 You can live in the Goshen region. You and your children and your grandchildren,
your sheep and goats and cattle, and everything that you own, will be near me.
11 Since there will be five more years of famine, I will make sure that you have

really I, Joseph, who am speaking to you.
13 Go and tell my father about how greatly I am honored here in Egypt. And tell him
about everything else that you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly!”
14 Then he threw his arms around his younger brother Benjamin’s neck and cried.
And Benjamin hugged him and cried.
15 And then as he kissed his older brothers on their cheeks, he cried. After that, his
brothers started to talk with him.
The king invited Joseph’s family to come and live in Egypt
16 Someone went to the palace and told the news that Joseph’s brothers had come.
The king and all his officials were pleased.
17 The king said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers this: ‘Put loads of grain on your
animals and return to the Canaan region.
18 Then bring your father and your families back here. I will give you the best land
in Egypt, and you will have the best food in the land to eat.’
19 “Also tell this to your brothers: ‘Take some carts from Egypt to carry your
children and your wives, and get them and your father and come back here quickly.
20 Do not worry about bringing your possessions, because the best things in Egypt
will be yours. Because of that, you will not need to bring any of your things from
Canaan.’ ”
21 Jacob’s sons did what the king suggested. Joseph gave them carts and food to eat
along the way, as the king had ordered.
GENESIS 45:22
76
GENESIS 46:8-25
22 To each of them he gave new clothes, but he gave 300 pieces of silver and five
sets of new clothes to Benjamin!
23 And this is what he sent to his father: Ten male donkeys, loaded with some of
the best goods that come from Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and
bread and other food for his father’s trip to Egypt.
24 Then he sent his brothers on their way, saying to them “Do not quarrel along the
way!”
25 So they left Egypt and came to their father Jacob in Canaan.
Egypt!” Jacob was extremely astonished; he could not believe that it was true.
carts that Joseph had sent to carry him and his family and possessions to Egypt. Then
28 He said, “What you have said is enough to convince me! My son Joseph is still
alive, and I will go and see him before I die!”
Jacob and his family moved to Egypt
46
1 So Jacob left Canaan, taking with him all his family and possessions. When they
arrived at Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to God, the one whom his father Isaac
worshiped.
2 That night, God called to Jacob in a vision, saying, “Jacob! Jacob!” He replied, “I
am here!”
3 God said, “I am God, the one your father worshiped. Do not be afraid to go down
to Egypt, because I will give you many descendants, and they will become a great
nation there.
4 I will go down to Egypt with you, and later I will bring your descendants back to
Canaan again. And Joseph will be with you [MTY] when you die.” [IDM]
5 Jacob left Beersheba, and his sons took their father, their wives, and their children,
in the carts that the king had sent for them to travel in.
6 So Jacob and all his family went to Egypt. They took with them the livestock and
all the other possessions that they had acquired in Canaan.
7 Jacob went to Egypt with all his sons and his daughters and grandsons and
granddaughters—his whole family.
8-25 ◄Here is/I will now give you► a list of the names of the members of Jacob’s
family who went with him to Egypt:
Reuben, Jacob’s oldest son;
Reuben’s sons Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi;
Simeon and his sons Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar, and Shaul, who was the
son of a Canaan people-group woman;
Levi and his sons Gershon, Kohath, and Merari;
Judah and his sons, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (his other sons, Er, and Onan, had
died in Canaan);
Perez and his two sons Hezron and Hamul;
Issachar and his sons Tola, Puah, Jashub, and Shimron;
Zebulon and his sons Sered, Elon, and Jahleel;
(Those were the sons of Jacob and Leah, and their daughter Dinah, who were born
in Paddan-Aram/Mesopotamia: There were 33 of them, altogether.) They had Gad
and his sons Zephon, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli;
Asher and his sons Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, and Beriah; and their sister Serah;
Beriah’s sons Heber and Malkiel;
GENESIS 46:26
77
GENESIS 47:3
(Those were the children and grandchildren of Jacob and Zilpah, the slave girl
Joseph and Benjamin, the sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel;
because they were already in Egypt. They were sons of Asenath, the daughter of
On, who was the priest in the temple in On city.)
Benjamin and his sons Bela, Beker, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim,
Huppim, and Ard;
(Those were the sons and grandsons of Rachel and Jacob: There were 14 people
altogether.)
Dan and his son Hushim;
Naphtali and his sons Jahziel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
(Those were the sons and grandsons of Jacob and Bilhah, the slave girl whom Laban
gave to his daughter Rachel: There were seven people altogether.)
26 Altogether there were 66 people who were Jacob’s descendants who went to
Egypt with him. That number does not include his sons’ wives.
27 Including Jacob and Joseph and Joseph’s two sons who were born in Egypt, there
were 70 members of Jacob’s family when they were all there in Egypt.
28 Jacob sent Judah to go ahead of the rest of them to talk with Joseph and ask for
directions on how to travel to Goshen. Then Judah returned to the rest of his family
and they all traveled to the Goshen region. When they arrived there,
29 Joseph got his chariot ready and went to Goshen to meet his father. When Joseph
arrived, he threw his arms around his father’s neck and cried a long time.
30 Jacob said to Joseph, “I have seen you and I know that you are still alive! So now
I am ready to die.”
Joseph arranged for his family to settle in Goshen
31 Then Joseph said to his older brothers and younger brother and to the rest of his
father’s family, “I will go to the king and say to him, ‘My older brothers and younger
brother and my father and the rest of his family, who were living in Canaan land,
have all come to me.
32 The men are all shepherds. They take care of their livestock, and they have
brought with them their sheep and goats and cattle, and everything else that they
own.’
33 When the king summons you and asks, ‘What work do you do?’
34 answer him by saying, ‘From the time when we were young, we have taken care
of livestock, just as our ancestors did.’ If you tell him that, he will let you live in the
Goshen region.” Joseph told them to say that because the people of Egypt despised
all shepherds.
47
Jacob blessed the king of Egypt
1-2 Joseph chose five of his older brothers to go with him to talk to the king.
He
introduced his older brothers to the king, and then he said, “My father and my older
brothers and younger brother have come from the Canaan region. They have brought
all their sheep and goats and cattle and everything else that they own, and they are
living now in Goshen region.”
shepherds, just as our ancestors were.”
GENESIS 47:4
78
GENESIS 47:22
4 They also said to him, “We have come here to live for a while in this land, because
the famine is very severe in Canaan, and our animals have no ◄pasture/grass to eat►
there. So now, please let us live in the Goshen region.”
5 The king said to Joseph, “I am happy that your father and your older brothers and
younger brother have come to you.
6 They can live wherever you want in the whole country of Egypt. Give your father
and your brothers the best part of the land. They can live in Goshen. And if you
know that any of them have any special ability to work with livestock, have them be
in charge of my own livestock, too.”
7 Then Joseph brought his father Jacob into the palace and introduced him to the
king. Jacob asked God to bless the king.
8 Then the king asked Jacob, “How old are you?”
9 Jacob replied, “I have been traveling around for 130 years. I have not lived as
long as my ancestors, but my life has been full of troubles.”
10 Then Jacob again asked God to bless the king, and left him.
11 That is how Joseph enabled his father and older brothers and younger brother to
start living in Egypt. As the king had commanded, he gave them property in the best
part of the land, in Goshen, which is now called Rameses.
12 Joseph also provided food for all his father’s family. The amounts that he gave
them were according to how many children each of them had.
Joseph arranged for people to buy grain from him during the famine
13 There were no crops growing in the whole region, because the famine was very
severe. The people of Egypt and Canaan [MTY] became weak because they did not
have enough food to eat.
14 Joseph collected all the money that the people in Egypt and Canaan paid for the
grain they were buying from him, and he brought the money to the king’s palace.
15 When the people of Egypt and Canaan had spent all their money for grain, they
all kept coming to Joseph and saying, “Please give us some food! If you do not give
us grain, we will die [RHQ]! We have used all our money to buy food, and we have
no money left!”
16 Joseph replied, “Since your money is all gone, bring me your livestock. If you do
that, I will give you food in exchange for your livestock.”
17 So they brought their livestock to Joseph. He gave them food in exchange for
their horses, their sheep and goats, their cattle, and their donkeys.
18 The next year they came to him again and said, “We cannot hide this from you:
We have no more money, and now our livestock belongs to you. We have only our
bodies and our land to give to you. We have nothing else left.
19 ◄If you do not give us some food, we will die!/Do you want to watch us die?►
[RHQ] If you do not give us seeds, our fields will become useless [IDM]. Buy us and
our land in exchange for food. Then we will be the king’s slaves, and he will own the
land. Give us seeds that we can plant and grow food, in order that we will not die,
20 So Joseph bought all the farms in Egypt for the king. The people of Egypt each
to get money to buy food. So all the farms became the king’s farms.
other to become the king’s slaves.
regularly, so the food that the king gave them was enough for them. That is the reason
they did not sell their land to him.
GENESIS 47:23
79
GENESIS 48:8
23 Joseph said to the people who sold themselves and their land to him, “Listen to
me! Today I have bought you and your land for the king. So here are seeds for you
so that you can plant them in the ground.
24 But when you harvest the crop, you must give one-fifth of the crop to the king.
The rest of the crop you can keep, to be seed to plant in the fields, and to be food for
you and your children and for everyone else in your household to eat.”
25 They replied, “You have saved our lives! We want you to be pleased with us. And
we will be the king’s slaves.”
26 So Joseph made a law about all the land in Egypt, stating that one-fifth of the
crops that are harvested belongs to the king. That law still exists. Only the land that
belonged to the priests did not become the king’s land.
27 Jacob and his family started to live in Egypt, in the Goshen region. They acquired
property there. Many children were born to them there. As a result, their population
increased greatly.
Jacob made Joseph promise to not bury him in Egypt after he died.
28 Jacob lived in Egypt 17 years. Altogether he lived 147 years.
29 When it was almost time for him to die, he summoned his son Joseph and said to
him, “If I have pleased you, make a solemn promise that you will be kind to me and
faithfully do what I am now asking you: When I die, do not bury me here in Egypt.
30 Instead, take my body out of Egypt, and bury it in Canaan where my ancestors
are buried.” Joseph replied, “I will do that.”
31 Jacob said, “◄Swear/Solemnly promise► to me that you will do it!” So Joseph
swore to do it. Then Jacob turned over in bed, bowed his head, and worshiped God.
48
Jacob blessed Ephraim and Manasseh
1 Some time later, someone told Joseph, “Hey, your father is ill.” When Joseph heard
that, he took his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, to see his father.
2 When someone told Jacob, “Look, your son Joseph has come to see you!” Jacob
sat up on the bed, even though it was difficult for him to do that.
3 He said to Joseph, “When I was at Luz in Canaan, God Almighty appeared to me.
He blessed me
4 and said to me, ‘I am going to enable you to become the father of many children.
5 “And now I will consider that your two sons, who were born to you here in Egypt
Manasseh will be as though they were my sons, and they will inherit my possessions,
just like my sons Reuben and Simeon and the others will.
6 If you later become the father of any more children, they will not be considered
to be my children, but as my grandchildren, and in Canaan they will receive as part
of what they inherit some of the same land that is in the territory that their brothers
Ephraim and Manasseh will inherit.
7 Many years ago, as I was returning from Paddan-Aram/Mesopotamia, your mother
Rachel died in the Canaan region, while we were still traveling, not far from Ephrath
town. So I buried her body there alongside the road to Ephrath [which is now called
Bethlehem].”
8 When Jacob saw Joseph’s sons, he asked, “Who are these boys?”
GENESIS 48:9
80
GENESIS 49:2
9 Joseph replied, “They are the sons that God has given to me here in Egypt.” Jacob
said, “Bring them close to me so that I can bless them.”
10 Jacob was almost blind because he was very old. He could not recognize the boys.
So Joseph brought his sons close to his father, and Jacob kissed them and hugged them.
11 Jacob said to Joseph, “I did not expect to see you again, but look at this! God has
allowed me to see not only you, but he has allowed me to see your children, too!”
Jacob blessed Joseph’s two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, in a way contrary to what
Joseph expected
12 Joseph took the boys from alongside Jacob’s knees. Then he bowed down with
his face to the ground.
13 Then Joseph took both of the boys, putting Ephraim on his right side toward
Jacob’s left hand, and putting Manasseh on his left side toward Jacob’s right hand,
and brought them close to Jacob.
14 But Jacob did not do what Joseph wanted him to do. Instead, he reached out his
right hand and put it on Ephraim’s head, even though he was the younger son. He
crossed his arms and put his left hand on Manasseh’s head, even though Manasseh
was the older son.
15 Then he ◄blessed/asked God to bless► Joseph and his sons, saying,
“My grandfather Abraham and my father Isaac conducted their lives as God desired,
and to this very day God has led me and taken care of me as a shepherd leads and
cares for his sheep [MET].
16 The angel whom he sent has kept me from being harmed in any way.
I pray that God will bless these boys.
I pray that people will never forget about me and about Abraham and Isaac because
of what God does for these boys.
I pray that they will have many descendants who will live all over the earth.”
17 When Joseph saw that his father had placed his right hand on Ephraim’s head
and not on Manasseh’s head, he was distressed/displeased. So he took his father’s
hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head.
18 Joseph said to him, “My father, that is not right! The one on whom you put your
left hand is my older son. Put your right hand on his head.”
Manasseh’s descendants will also become a people-group, and they will become
His descendants will become several nations.”
names when they bless people. They will say, ‘We pray that God will help you as he
helped Ephraim and Manasseh.’ ” In that way, Jacob said that Ephraim would become
more important than Manasseh.
21 Then Jacob said to Joseph, “I am about to die. But I know that God will help/
protect you. And some day he will take your descendants back to the land of their
ancestors.
22 And it is to you, not to your brothers, that I will give the fertile hill in the Shechem
area. I captured that land from the Amor people-group, fighting them with my sword
and my bow and arrows.”
49
Jacob prophesied what would happen to his sons and their descendants
1 Jacob summoned all his sons, and said to them,
2 “Gather around me in order that I can tell you what will happen in the future.
GENESIS 49:3
81
GENESIS 49:15
My sons, come and listen to me.
I am your father, Jacob, whom God named Israel.
3 Reuben, you are my oldest son.
You were born when I was young and energetic/strong.
You are prouder and stronger than all the rest of my sons.
4 But you were as uncontrollable as a flood [SIM].
So now you will not be my most important son,
because you climbed up onto my bed,
and had sex with [MTY] my ◄concubine/slave who had become one of my wives►.
Your doing that caused me, your father, to have great shame.
5 Simeon and Levi, you have both acted like criminals.
You use your swords to act violently.
6 I do not want to be with you when you make evil plans [DOU].
I do not want to join you in your meetings,
because you killed people when you became very angry,
and you ◄hamstrung/cut the tendons in the legs of► oxen just to ◄have fun/see them
suffer►.
7 God says, ‘I will ◄curse/cause bad things to happen to► them for being very angry,
for acting very cruelly when they were very furious.
I will scatter their descendants [MTY] throughout Israel land.’
8 Judah, your older and younger brothers will praise you.
They will bow down before you,
because you will thoroughly defeat [MTY] your enemies.
9 Judah is like a young lion [SIM] that has returned to its den satisfied
after eating the animals that it has killed.
He is like a lion that lies down and stretches out after eating;
10 There will always be a ruler [MTY] from the descendants of Judah [MTY].
He will do that until the one to whom the scepter belongs comes,
and show that they will obey him.
11 The grapevines of Judah’s descendants will produce grapes very abundantly.
As a result, they will not object to tying their young donkeys to the grapevines
in order that the donkeys can eat the leaves of the grapevines.
Wine will be very plentiful, with the result that
they could wash their cloaks in wine that is as red as blood [MET].
12 Their eyes will be red because of drinking too much wine,
but their teeth will be very white because of drinking much milk from the cows.
13 Zebulun, your descendants will live by the seashore
where there will be a safe harbor for ships.
Their land will extend north as far as Sidon city.
14 Issachar, your descendants will be like strong donkeys
that are lying down on the ground between their loads,
so tired that they cannot get up!
15 They will see that their resting place is good,
and that the land pleases them very much.
But they will bend their backs to carry heavy loads
and be forced to work for others.
GENESIS 49:16
82
GENESIS 49:29
16 Dan, although your tribe will be small,
their leaders will rule their people just like the leaders of other tribes of Israel will
rule their people.
17 Your descendants will be like snakes at the side of a road,
like poisonous snakes lying beside a path.
They will strike the heels of horses that pass by,
causing the riders to fall backwards as the horses rear up on their hind legs.”
18 Then Jacob prayed, “Yahweh, I am waiting for you to rescue me from my enemies.”
19 Then Jacob continued telling his sons what would happen in the future. He said,
“Gad, your tribe/descendants will be attacked by a group of bandits,
but your tribe/descendants will pursue and attack them [MTY].
20 Asher, your descendants will eat good-tasting food;
they will produce food that is delicious enough for kings to eat.
21 Naphtali, your descendants will be like deer [MET] that are ◄free to/not tied down
and can► run wherever they wish.
They will give birth to children who are good-looking like ◄fawns/baby deer► [MET].
22 Joseph, you will have many descendants [MET].
Their children will be as many as the fruit on a vine near a spring of water,
whose branches extend over a wall.
23 Their enemies will attack them fiercely,
and shoot at them with bows and arrows and pursue them.
24 But they will hold their bows steady and their arms will remain strong,
because of the power [MTY] of my mighty God,
like a shepherd guides and provides for his sheep.
like people hide under a huge overhanging rock to be protected.
25 God, the one whom I worship, will help your descendants.
God Almighty will bless them
by sending them rain from the sky
and by giving them water from deep/far below the ground.
He will give them many cattle and children [MET] (OR, and their cattle will have
many offspring).
26 The blessings that I want God to give you are great ones.
They are greater than the blessings that come from the eternal mountains,
greater than the ones that come from the everlasting hills.
Joseph, I pray that these blessings will ◄be given to you/come upon your head►,
because you are the leader of your older brothers and younger brother.
27 Benjamin, your descendants will be like [MET] vicious/fierce wolves:
In the morning they will kill their enemies
like a wolf devours ◄its prey/the animals that it has killed►,
and in the evening they will divide among their warriors the spoils that they seized
from their enemies.”
28 Those twelve sons are the ancestors of the twelve tribes of Israel. That is what
their father said to them as he blessed them, telling to each one words that were
appropriate for him.
Jacob died
29 Then Jacob said to his sons, “I will soon die.
Bury my body where some of my
ancestors are buried, in the cave that is in the field that was bought from Ephron,
who belonged to the Heth people-group.
GENESIS 49:30
83
GENESIS 50:14
30 That
field is in the Machpelah area, east of Mamre town, in Canaan. My
grandfather Abraham bought it from Ephron to use as a burial place.
31 That is where they buried him and his wife Sarah. That is where they buried my
father Isaac and his wife Rebekah. And that is where I buried my wife Leah.
32 That field and the cave in it were bought from the Heth people-group; so that is
where I want you to bury me.”
33 When Jacob finished giving those instructions to his sons, he lay down on his bed
again. Then he died [IDM].
50
Jacob’s body was taken to Canaan and buried there
1 Joseph leaned close to his father’s face and cried over him and kissed him.
2 Joseph commanded his servants who were morticians to ◄embalm his father’s
body/put spices on his father’s body► to ◄preserve it/keep it from decaying►, and
3 So the morticians did that. It took 40 days to embalm Jacob’s body, because that
people of Egypt mourned for 70 days because of Jacob’s death.
4 When the time of mourning was finished, Joseph said to the king’s officials, “If
you are pleased with me, please take this message to the king:
5 ‘When my father was about to die, he told me to solemnly promise that I would
bury his body in Canaan, in the tomb that he himself had prepared. So please let me
go up to Canaan and bury my father’s body. Then I will return.’ ”
6 After they gave the king the message, he replied, “Tell Joseph, ‘Go up and bury
your father’s body, as you ◄swore/solemnly promised► that you would do.’ ”
7 So Joseph went up to Canaan to bury his father’s body. All of the king’s officials,
all the king’s advisors, and all the elders in Egypt went with him.
8 His own family’s small children and their sheep and goats and their cattle stayed
in the Goshen region. But all the rest of Joseph’s family and his older brothers and
younger brother and his father’s family went with him.
9 Men riding in chariots [MTY] and on horses also went along. It was a huge group.
10 They went to the east side of the Jordan River and arrived at Atad. There was
a place there where people ◄threshed/beat the grain to separate the wheat from
the chaff.► There they mourned loudly for Jacob for a long time. Joseph performed
mourning ceremonies for his father for seven days.
11 When the Canaan people-group who lived there saw them mourning like that,
they said, “This is a sad mourning place for the people of Egypt!” So they named the
place Abel-Mizraim, which sounds like the Hebrew words that mean ‘mourning of the
Egyptians.’
12 Then Jacob’s sons did for him what their father had commanded.
13 They crossed the Jordan River and carried Jacob’s body to Canaan. They buried
it in the cave in the field at Machpelah, east of Mamre town. That was the field that
Abraham had bought from Ephron, who was one of the Heth people-group, to use as
a burial place.
14 After he had buried his father, Joseph and his older brothers and younger brother
and all the others who had gone up to Canaan with him for the funeral returned to
Egypt.
Joseph told his brothers that he would not get revenge for what they did to him
GENESIS 50:15
84
15 After Jacob died, Joseph’s brothers became worried.
GENESIS 50:26
They realized what might
happen. They said, “Suppose Joseph hates us and tries to get revenge for all the evil
things that we did to him many years ago?”
16 So they sent someone to tell this to Joseph for them: “Before our father died, he
told us this:
17 ‘Say to Joseph, “Please forgive your older brothers for the evil thing that they
did to you, for their terrible sin against you, because what they did to you was very
wrong.” ’ So now we, who are servants of your father’s God, ask you, please forgive
us for what we did to you.” But Joseph just cried when he received their message.
18 Then his older brothers themselves came and threw themselves on the ground in
19 But Joseph replied to them, “Do not be afraid! God is the one who punishes people;
20 As for you, yes, you wanted to do something very evil to me. But God caused
hunger, and that is what happened! Today they are alive!
have enough to eat.” In that way he reassured them and made made them feel much
better.
Joseph died in Egypt
22 Joseph lived with his father’s family in Egypt until he was 110 years old.
23 He lived long enough to see Ephraim’s children and grandchildren. The children
of Joseph’s grandson Machir, who was Manasseh’s son, were born before Joseph died,
and were adopted by Joseph to be his own children [IDM].
24 One day Joseph said to his older brothers, “I am about to die. But God will
certainly ◄help/take care of► you. And some day he will lead your descendants up
out of this land and take them to Canaan, the land that he solemnly promised to give
to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”
25 Then Joseph said, “When God enables you to do that, you must take my body
back to Canaan.” He made his older brothers solemnly promise to do that.
26 So Joseph died in Egypt when he was 110 years old. His body was embalmed and
put in a coffin there.

8 Then several hundred years later, a new king began to rule [MTY] in Egypt. He did
not know what Joseph had done for the people of Egypt long ago.
9 He said to his people, “Look at what has happened! The Israeli people have become
so numerous and so powerful that they now might conquer us!
10 We must find a way to control them! If we do not do that, their population will
continue to grow. Then, if enemies [PRS] attack us, they will join with our enemies
and fight against us, and they will escape from our land.”
to suffer very much by forcing them to work very hard. They forced the Israeli
government.
population grew, and they became more numerous all over the land. So the Egyptian
13 They forced the Israeli people to work very hard,
14 and by making them slaves, they made their lives miserable. They forced them
to build many buildings with mortar and bricks. They also forced them to do other
work in the fields. In making them do all this work, the Egyptian officials treated them
ruthlessly/cruelly.
15 There were two Hebrew ◄midwives/women who helped the women when they
were giving birth►. [Hebrew means the same as Israeli.] The names of the women
were Shiphrah and Puah. The king of Egypt said to those two women,
16 “When you help the Hebrew women when they are giving birth [MTY], if the
baby that is born is a boy, you must kill it. If the baby is a girl, you ◄may let it live/do
not have to kill them►.”
17 But the midwives feared/revered God. So they did not do what the king told them
to do. They allowed the baby boys to live.
18 So the king summoned the two midwives and said to them, “Why are you doing
this? Why are you letting the baby boys live?”
EXODUS 1:19
86
EXODUS 2:12
19 One of the midwives replied to the king, “You need to realize that the Hebrew
women are not like the Egyptian women. The Hebrew women are very strong/healthy.
They give birth to their babies before we can get to them to help them.”
20 So God acted kindly toward the midwives, and the Hebrew people became even
more numerous and strong.
21 Furthermore, because the midwives feared/revered God, he enabled them also
to give birth to children.
22 Then the king commanded all ◄the Egyptian people/his advisors►: “You must
throw into the Nile River every baby boy born that the Hebrew women give birth to!
But you can allow the baby girls to live.”

After Moses was born he was later adopted by the king’s daughter
1 ◄There was a man who/My father► was descended from Jacob’s son Levi.
He
married a woman who was also descended from Levi.
2 She became pregnant and gave birth to ◄a baby boy/me►. When she saw that
he/I was a good-looking baby, she hid him/me for three months, because she was not
willing to do what the king commanded.
3 When she was unable to ◄hide him/me/keep it a secret► any longer, she got a
basket made from tall reeds. She covered the basket with tar ◄to make it waterproof/
so water could not get in►. Then she put him/me in the basket and put the basket in
the water in the middle of the tall grass at the edge of the Nile River.
4 His/My older sister was standing not far away, watching to see what would happen
5 Soon the king’s daughter went down to the river to bathe. Her female servants
So she sent one of her servants to get it.
6 When the servant brought the basket to her, she opened it, and was surprised to
see ◄a baby that was/me►, crying. She felt sorry for him/me, and said, “This must be
one of the Hebrews’ babies.”
7 Then ◄the baby’s/my► older sister approached the king’s daughter and said, “Do
you want me to go and find someone from among the Hebrew women who will be
able to nurse the baby for you?”
8 The king’s daughter said to her, “Yes, go and find one.” So the girl went and
summoned ◄the baby’s/my► mother.
9 The king’s daughter said to her, “Please take this baby and nurse him for me. I
will pay you for doing that.” So ◄the woman/my mother► took him/me and nursed
him/me.
10 ◄A few years later/when ◄the child/I► grew older►, she brought him/me to the
king’s daughter. She adopted him/me as though I was her own son. She named him/
me Moses, which sounds like the Hebrew words ‘pull out’, because she said “I pulled
him out of the water.”
Moses, after murdering an Egyptian, escaped to Midian and later married Zipporah
11 One day, after Moses/I had grown up, he/I went out of the palace area to see his/
my people, the Hebrews. He/I saw how they were being forced to work very hard. He/
I also saw an Egyptian man beating one of his/my Hebrew people.
12 He/I looked around to see if anyone was watching. Seeing no one, he/I killed the
Egyptian man and buried his body in the sand.
EXODUS 2:13
87
EXODUS 3:3
13 The next day he/I returned to the same place.
He/I was surprised to see two
Hebrew men who were fighting each other. He/I said to the man who started the
fight, “Why are you ◄you should not be► striking your fellow Hebrew.”
14 The man replied, “◄Who made you our ruler and judge?/No one made you our
ruler and judge!► [RHQ] You have no right to interfere with us Are you going to kill me
just like you killed that Egyptian man yesterday?” Then Moses/I was afraid, because
he/I thought, “Since that man knows what I did, surely other people know, too.”
15 And that was correct. The king heard about what he/I had done to that Egyptian.
So he ordered his soldiers to execute/kill Moses/me. But he/I fled from the king and
left Egypt. He/I traveled east to the Midian region and started to live there.
16 The man who was the ◄priest/one who offered the people’s gifts to God► for the
Midian people, whose name was Jethro, had seven daughters. One day as Moses/I sat
down beside a well, those girls came to the well and got water, and filled the troughs
in order to give water to their father’s flock of sheep.
17 Some ◄shepherds/men who took care of other sheep► came and started to chase
away the girls. But Moses/I helped/rescued the girls, and got water for their sheep.
18 When the girls returned to their father Jethro, whose other name is Reuel, he

should not leave him out there!► [RHQ] Invite him in, so he can have something to
eat [MTY]!”
21 So they did, and Moses/I accepted and ate with them. And Moses/I decided to live
there. Later Jethro gave him/me his daughter Zipporah to be his/my wife.
22 Later she gave birth to a son, and Moses/I named him Gershom, which sounds like
the Hebrew words that mean ‘foreigner’, because he/I said, “I am living as a foreigner
in this land.”
23 Many years later the king of Egypt died. The Israeli people in Egypt were still
groaning because of the hard work they had to do as slaves. They called out for
someone to help them, and God heard them call out [PRS].
24 He heard them groaning. And he ◄thought about/did not forget► that he had
solemnly promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to bless their descendants.
25 God saw how the Israeli people were being badly treated, and he was concerned
about them.
3
God talked to Moses from inside a burning bush, and told him to lead his people out
of Egypt
1 Moses/I was taking care of the sheep that belonged to his/my father-in-law Jethro,
the priest of the Midian people. He/I led the flock across the desert and came to Horeb,
the mountain that was later called Sinai, the ◄mountain that had been dedicated to
God/taboo mountain►.
2 One day Yahweh ◄appeared/revealed himself► to him/me, looking like an angel.
The angel appeared in a flame of fire in the middle of a bush that was burning. Moses/I
looked at it, and he/I was surprised that the bush was burning, but it was not burning
up.
3 Moses/I thought, “I will go closer and try to see this strange sight! Why is the bush
not burning up?”
EXODUS 3:4
88
EXODUS 3:20
4 When Yahweh saw that he/I had come closer, he called to Moses/me from the
middle of the bush, saying, “Moses! Moses!” He/I replied, “Yes, here I am.”
5 Yahweh said, “Do not come closer! Because I am God, the ground on which you
are standing is holy/taboo. So take off your sandals to show respect to me.”
6 Then he said, “I am God, whom your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
worshiped.” So Moses/I covered his/my face, because he/I was afraid that God would
kill him/me if he/I looked at him.
7 Then Yahweh said, “I have seen how cruelly they are treating my people in Egypt.
I have heard them ◄wailing/crying out► for help because of what the slave-drivers
are forcing them to do. I know how my people are suffering.
8 So I have come down from heaven to rescue them from the Egyptians [SYN]. I have
come to bring them up from that land to the highlands in Canaan. I will bring them to
a land that is good/fertile and that has plenty of space. It will be very good for raising
livestock and growing crops [MTY]. It is the land where the descendants of Canaan,
Heth, Amor, Periz, Hiv, and Jebus live.

king and ask him to permit me to bring the Israeli people out of Egypt!/How can I go
to the king and ask him to allow me to bring the Israeli people out of Egypt?►” [RHQ]
12 God replied, “I will be with you. And when you bring my people out of Egypt,
all of you will worship me right here on this mountain. That will prove that I am the
one who sent you to them.”
13 Moses/I said to God, “If I go to the Israeli people and say to them, ‘God, the one
your ancestors worshiped, has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’,
what shall I say to them?”
14 God replied, “I AM who I AM.” And he said, “Tell the Israeli people that the one
who is named ‘I AM’ has sent me to you.”
15 God also said to Moses/me, “Say this to the Israeli people: ‘Yahweh God, the one
your ancestors worshiped, the one that Abraham and Isaac and Jacob worshiped, has
sent me to you.’ This name, Yahweh, will be my name forever. That is the name that
people in all future generations must use when they talk about/to me.
16 Go to Egypt and gather together the elders/leaders of the Israeli people, and say
to them, ‘Yahweh God, the one your ancestors worshiped, the one Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob worshiped, appeared to me. He said to him/me, “I have been watching
closely what the Egyptian people have done to you.
17 I promise that I will rescue you from being oppressed in Egypt, and I will take
you to the land where the descendants of Canaan, Heth, Amor, Periz, Hiv, and Jebus
live. It is a land good for raising livestock and growing crops [MTY].” ’
18 My people will do what you say. Then you and their leaders must go to the king of
Egypt, and you must say to him, ‘Yahweh, who is God, the one we Hebrews worship,
has revealed himself to us. So now we ask you to allow us to travel for three days to
a place in the desert, in order that there we may offer sacrifices to Yahweh, our God.’
19 But I know that the king of Egypt will allow you to go only if he realizes I am

EXODUS 4:14
21 When that happens, I will cause the people of Egypt to respect you.
The result
will be that when you leave Egypt, ◄you will not go empty-handed/they will give you
many valuable things to take with you►.
22 At that time, each Israeli woman will ask her Egyptian neighbors and each
Egyptian woman who is living in her (OR, her neighbor’s) house to give her some
silver and gold jewelry and some nice clothes. Each Egyptian woman will give them
some, and you will put them on your sons and daughters to take with you. In that
way you will ◄take away/confiscate► the wealth of the Egyptian people.”

After Moses tried to resist Yahweh’s appointment, Yahweh gave him power to
perform miracles

3 He said, “Throw it down on the ground!” So, he/I threw it on the ground, and it
became a snake! And he/I ran/jumped away from it.
4 But Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Reach down and pick it up by its tail!” So he/I
reached down and caught it, and when he/I picked it up, it became a stick in his/my
hand again.
5 Yahweh said, “Do the same thing in front of the Israeli people, in order that they
may believe that I, Yahweh God, the one Abraham and Isaac and Jacob worshiped,
truly appeared to you.”
6 Yahweh spoke to Moses/me again, saying “Put your hand inside your robe [MTY]!”
He/I did that. And when he/I took it out again, surprisingly, his/my hand was white.
It had a skin disease that made it as white as snow.
7 Then God said, “Put your hand back inside your robe [MTY]!” So he/I did that,
and when he/I took it out again, surprisingly, it was normal again, just like the rest
of his/my body!
8 God said, “You can do that in front of the Israeli people, too. If they do not pay
attention to what you say because of seeing the first miracle, they will ◄believe you/
be convinced► when you perform the second miracle.
9 If they do not believe you or do what you say, even after you perform those two
miracles, get some water from the Nile River and pour it on the ground. When you do
that, the water from the river that you pour on the ground will become blood [MTY]
(OR, red like blood).”
10 Moses/I replied, “O Yahweh! I am not an eloquent speaker! I was not an eloquent
speaker before, and I have not become one since you started talking to me! I am not
a good speaker [MTY], and I speak very slowly.”
11 Then Yahweh said to him/me, “You seem to forget who it is that makes people
able to speak [RHQ]! Who is it that enables people to be unable to speak or unable to
hear, or able to see or not to see? It is I, Yahweh [RHQ]!
12 So start going to Egypt, and I will help you to speak [MTY], and I will tell you
what you should say.”
13 But he/I replied, “O, Yahweh, I ask you, please send someone else instead!”
14 Then Yahweh became very angry with Moses/me. He said, “What about your
older brother Aaron, who is also a descendant of Levi? I know that he is a very good/

EXODUS 4:31
eloquent speaker. He is actually on his way here right now, and he will be very happy
to see you.
15 You can talk to him and tell him what to say [MTY], and I will help both of you
[SYN] to know what to say [MTY]. And I will tell you both what you should do.
16 He will speak for you to the Israeli people. He will be ◄your spokesman/as though
he was your mouth► [MET], and you will be to him as though you are his god.

you will perform miracles with it.”

because the men who were wanting to kill you [MTY] are now dead.”
20 So Moses/I took his/my wife and sons and put them on donkeys, and they/we
returned to Egypt. And Moses/I took in his/my hand the stick that God told him/me to
take along.
21 Yahweh said to Moses/me, “When you return to Egypt, be sure to perform all the
miracles that I have given you power to do, while the king is watching. But I will
make him stubborn [IDM], with the result that he will not let the Israeli people leave
Egypt.
22 Then say to him, ‘This is what Yahweh says: “The Israeli people [MTY] are as dear
to me as firstborn sons [MET].
23 I told you to let my people [MTY] leave Egypt, in order that they may worship
me in the desert. If you refuse to let them go, I warn you, I will kill your firstborn
son!” ’ ”
Zipporah circumcised her son
24 One night, as they were camping on the way to Egypt, Yahweh appeared to Moses/
me. He wanted/threatened to kill Moses/me for disobeying his command that boys/
sons be circumcised.
25 Then his/my wife Zipporah took a flint knife and circumcised her son. Then she
touched the boy’s feet (OR, genitals) with the piece of skin she had cut off, and she
said, “The blood which flowed when I circumcised you will protect you from being
harmed by Yahweh [MET].”
26 She said to him, “You are safe now [MET] because you have been circumcised.”
So Yahweh did not harm her son.
The Israeli people believed Moses when he and Aaron talked to them
27 Yahweh said to Aaron, “Go into the desert to meet/see Moses!” So he went there
from Egypt and met him/me at Sinai, the mountain dedicated to God, and greeted him/
me by kissing him/me on the cheek.
28 Moses/I told Aaron everything that Yahweh had said to him/me when he told
him/me to return to Egypt. He/I also told Aaron about all the miracles that Yahweh
told him/me to perform.
29 So Aaron and Moses/I returned to Egypt. There they/we gathered together all the
Israeli elders/leaders.
30 Aaron told them everything that Yahweh had told Moses/ me, and Aaron
performed all the miracles as the people watched.
31 They believed that what they/we were saying was true. When they heard that
Yahweh had seen how the Israeli people were being cruelly oppressed and that he
was going to help them, they bowed down and worshiped Yahweh.

The king refused to let the Israeli people go after Moses and Aaron talked to him
1 Then Aaron and Moses/I went to the king and one of them/us said, “Yahweh God,
whom we Israeli people worship, says this to you: ‘Let my people go to the desert, in
order that they may have a feast to honor me!’ ”
2 But the king said, “Who is Yahweh? Why should I pay attention to what he says
not let the Israeli people go!”
himself/appeared► to us and told us what to tell you. So we ask you to please let
us go on a three day journey into the desert. We must offer sacrifices to Yahweh God
there. If we do not do that, he will cause us to die [IDM] from diseases or from attacks
by our enemies [MTY].”
4 But the king of Egypt said to them/us, “Moses and Aaron, ◄stop trying to keep
the Israeli people from working/why are you preventing the Israeli people from
working?► [RHQ] Tell those slaves to return to work!”
5 The king also said, “Listen to me! You people who now live in this land are now
more numerous, and you want them to stop working and rest!”
The king increased the amount of work the Israelis were forced to do
6 That same day the king commanded the Egyptian slave bosses and the Israeli men
supervising the slaves,
7 “Do not continue to give the Israeli people straw for making bricks, as you have
done previously. Make them go into the fields and gather straw for themselves.
8 But require them to make the same number of bricks that they did before. Do not
decrease the number at all. They ◄are lazy/do not have enough work to do►. That is
the reason they are asking me to let them go into the desert to offer sacrifices to their
god.
9 Force the men to work harder, so that they will not have time to listen to lies from
their leaders!”
10 So the slave bosses and supervisors of the slaves went to where the Israeli people
were and said to them, “The king has said that he will no longer give you any straw.
11 So you yourselves must go and get straw wherever you can find it. But you must
still keep working to make the same number of bricks as before.” [LIT]
12 So the Israeli people went all over Egypt to find straw.
13 The slave bosses kept telling them insistently, “Finish the work you are required
to do each day, making the same amount of bricks as you did before, when we gave
you straw!”
14 When they were not able to do that, the slave bosses had the Israeli supervisors
beaten with sticks, and they asked them, “Why have all the men you are supervising
not been able to make the same number of bricks today/now as they did before [RHQ]?”
The king refused to pay attention to the complaints of the Israelis
15 Then the Israeli supervisors went to the king and complained,
saying “Your
Majesty, why are you treating us this way?
16 Now they are not giving us any straw for making bricks, but they keep
commanding us to make bricks. And now sometimes they beat us. But it is the
fault of your own slave bosses that we cannot make as many bricks as before!”
17 But the king said, “You are lazy and do not want to work! That is why you keep
18 So go and get back to work!
We are not going to give you any straw, but you
must keep making the same number of bricks!”
19 The Israeli supervisors realized that they were in a difficult situation, because
they had been told, “We are not going to decrease the number of bricks you must
make each day.”
20 As they left the king’s palace, they met Aaron and Moses/me, who were waiting
for them there.
21 They said to Aaron and Moses/me, “Yahweh has seen what you two have done He
will punish you [MTY], because you have caused the king and his officials to despise
us! You have given them an excuse [MTY] to kill us!”
22 Moses/I left them and prayed to Yahweh again, saying, “O Yahweh, why have you
caused all these evil things to happen to your people [RHQ]? And why did you send
me here [RHQ]?
23 Ever since I went to the king and told him what you told me to say [MTY], he
has treated your people very cruelly, and you have not done anything to help/rescue
them!”
6
Yahweh promised to rescue them
1 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Now you will see what I will do to the king and
his people. I will powerfully [MTY] compel him to let my people go. In fact, by my
power [MTY] I will force him to expel them from his land!”
2 God also said to Moses/me, “I am Yahweh.
3 I am the one who appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and told them that I
was God Almighty, but I did not tell them that my name was Yahweh.
4 I also made my solemn agreement with them, promising to give them the Canaan
region. That was the area in which they were living as foreigners.
5 Furthermore, I have heard the Israeli people as they were groaning because of the
hard work that the Egyptians forced them to do as their slaves. I have thought about
that solemn promise that I made.
6 So tell the Israeli people that I said this: ‘I am Yahweh. I will free you from the
burdens of heavy work that the Egyptians have given you. I will free you from being
their slaves. With my great power [MTY] and by punishing them [MTY] very severely,
I will save you.
7 I will cause you to be my own people, and I will be your God, the one you worship.
You will truly know that I, Yahweh your God, am the one who has freed you from the
burdens of work as slaves of the Egyptians.
8 And I will bring you to the land that I solemnly promised to give to Abraham, to
Isaac, and to Jacob. You will possess it forever. I, Yahweh, am promising this.’ ”
9 Moses/I told that to the Israeli people, but they did not believe what he/I said. They
were very discouraged [IDM] because of the hard work that they had been forced to
do as slaves.
Aaron and Moses gave God’s message to the king again
10 Yahweh said to Moses/me,
11 “Go and tell the king of Egypt again that he must allow the Israeli people to leave
his land!”
12 But Moses/I said to Yahweh, “Listen to what I am saying. Even the Israeli people
have not paid attention to what I told them. But I am a poor speaker. [MET, MTY] So
attention to what I tell him!►” [RHQ]
EXODUS 6:13
93
EXODUS 7:3
13 But Yahweh spoke to Aaron and Moses/me and commanded them/us, “Tell the
Israeli people and the king of Egypt that I have commissioned you two to lead the
Israeli people out of Egypt.”
The ancestors of Moses and Aaron
14 ◄Here is/I will now give you► a list of the ancestors of Moses/me and Aaron:
The sons of Reuben, who was Jacob’s oldest son, were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and
Carmi. They were ancestors of the clans that have those same names.
15 The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul. Shaul’s
mother was a woman from the Canaan people-group. Those men also were ancestors
of clans that have those same names.
16 These are the names of the sons of Levi, in the order in which they were born:
Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Levi was 137 years old when he died.
have those names.
years old when he died.
19 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. All of those people whose names I
have listed belonged to tribes/clans descended from Levi, in the order in which they
were born.
20 Amram married his father’s sister, Jochebed. She was the mother of Aaron and
Moses/me. Amram was 137 years old when he died.
21 The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.
22 The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.
23 Aaron married Elisheba. She was the daughter of Amminadab and sister of
Nahshon. Elisheba gave birth to four sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
24 The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. They were the ancestors
of the Korah people-group.
25 Aaron’s son Eleazar married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she gave birth to
Phinehas. That ends the list of the families and clans that were descended from Levi.
26 Aaron and Moses/I were the ones to whom Yahweh said, “Lead all the families
and clans of the Israeli people out of Egypt.”
27 They/We were the ones who spoke to the king of Egypt about bringing the Israeli
people out of Egypt.
28 On the day that Yahweh spoke to Moses/me in Egypt,
29 he said, “I am Yahweh. You must tell the king everything that I say to you.”
30 But Moses/I said to Yahweh, “Listen to me. I am not a good speaker. [MET, MTY]
So ◄the king will certainly not pay attention to what I say/why should the king pay
attention to what I tell him?►!” [RHQ]

Yahweh instructed Moses and Aaron

Just like I enabled prophet to

3 But I will make the king stubborn [IDM]. As a result, even though I perform many
kinds of ◄miracles/terrifying things► [DOU] here in Egypt,
EXODUS 7:4
94
EXODUS 7:21
4 the king will not pay any attention to what you say.
Then I will punish [MTY]
the people of Egypt [MTY] very severely [MTY], and I will lead/bring the tribes of the
Israeli people out of Egypt.
5 Then, when I show my great power [MTY] to the Egyptian people and bring the
Israeli people out from among them, they will know that I, Yahweh, have the power
to do what I say that I will do.”
6 Aaron and Moses/I did what Yahweh told them/us to do. They/We went and spoke
to the king.
7 At that time, Moses/I was 80 years old, and Aaron was 83 years old.
Aaron made his stick become a snake, but that did not influence the king
8 Yahweh said to Moses/me,
9 “If the king says to you, ‘Prove that God sent you by performing a miracle,’ then
say to Aaron, ‘Throw your stick down in front of the king, in order that it may become
a snake.’ ”
10 So Aaron and Moses/I went to the king and did what Yahweh had commanded
them/us to do. Aaron threw his stick down in front of the king and his officials, and
it became a snake.
11 Then the king summoned his sorcerers and men who performed magic. They
did the same thing, using their magic.
12 They all threw down their sticks, and they became snakes. But Aaron’s stick,
which had become a snake, swallowed up all their sticks!
13 But the king continued to be stubborn [IDM], just as Yahweh had predicted, and
he would not pay attention to what Aaron and Moses/I said.
Moses and Aaron caused the Nile River to become red
14 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “The king is very stubborn [IDM]. He refuses to
allow my people to go.
15 So tomorrow morning, go to him as he is going down to the Nile River to bathe.
Wait for him at the riverbank. When he comes out of the water, show him the stick,
the one which became a snake.
16 Say to him, ‘Yahweh God, the one we Hebrews worship, sent me to you to tell you
to let my people go, in order that they may worship him in the desert. We told you
that, but you have not paid any attention to it.

18 Then the fish in the Nile River will die, and the water in the river will stink, and
19 Yahweh said to Moses/me, “When you are talking to the king, say to Aaron, ‘Hold
the canals, the ponds, and over the pools of water, in order that all of it may become
wooden jars and in stone jars.”
20 So Aaron and Moses/I did what Yahweh commanded. As the king and his officials
were watching, Aaron lifted up his stick and then struck the water in the Nile River
with it. And all the water in the river turned red like blood.
21 Then all the fish died. And the water stank, with the result that the Egyptians
could not drink water from the river. Everywhere in Egypt the water became red like
blood.

EXODUS 8:14
22 But the men who performed magic did the same thing using their magic. So the
king remained stubborn [IDM], and he would not pay attention to what Aaron and
Moses/I said, just as Yahweh had predicted.
23 The king turned and went back to his palace, and he did not think any more
about it [IDM].
24 The Egyptians [HYP] dug into the ground near the Nile River to get water to drink,
because they could not drink the water from the river.
Moses and Aaron caused frogs to appear everywhere
25 ◄One week/Seven days► passed after Yahweh caused the water in the Nile River
to become red like blood.

1 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Go back to the king and tell him, ‘Yahweh says
that you must let my people go, in order that they can worship me in the desert.
2 But if you refuse to let them go, I will punish you by sending frogs to cover your
country.
3 Not only will the Nile River be full of frogs, but the frogs will come up out of the
river into your palace. They will come into your bedroom and onto your bed. They
will be in the houses of your officials and all the rest of your people. They will even
get into your ovens and your pans for mixing the materials for baking bread.
4 The frogs will jump up on you and your officials and all the rest of your people.’ ”
5 Yahweh also said to Moses/me, “Say this to Aaron: ‘Hold your stick in your hand
and stretch it out as though you were stretching it over the river, the canals, and
over the pools, and cause frogs to come up from all this water and cover the land of
Egypt.’ ”
6 After Moses/I told that to Aaron, he stretched out his hand as though he were
stretching it over all the water in Egypt. And the frogs came up from the water and
covered Egypt.
7 But the men who performed magic did the same thing, and they caused more
frogs to come up from the water onto the land.
8 Then the king summoned Moses/me and said, “Ask Yahweh to take away these
frogs from me and my people. After that happens, I will allow your people to go, in
order that they can offer sacrifices to Yahweh.”
9 Moses/I said to the king, “I will be glad to pray for you and for your officials and
for the rest of your people. I will ask Yahweh to get rid of the frogs from all your
houses. The only frogs left will be those in the Nile River. Just tell me when I should
pray.”
10 He replied, “Tomorrow.” So Moses/I said, “I will do what you say, and then you
will know that Yahweh God, the one we worship, is the only true god, and that there
is no other god like him.
11 The frogs will leave you and your officials and all the rest of your people. The
only ones left will be in the Nile River.”
12 Aaron and Moses/I left the king. Then Moses/I prayed to Yahweh, asking him to
take away all the frogs he had brought to the king’s land.
13 And Yahweh did just what Moses/I asked him to do. As a result, all the frogs in
the houses, in their courtyards, and in the fields died.
14 The people gathered together all the dead frogs into big piles, and the land stank
from the smell.
EXODUS 8:15

EXODUS 8:31
15 But when the king saw that the problem was ended, he became stubborn [IDM]
again. And just as Yahweh had predicted, he would not pay attention to what Aaron
and Moses/we told him.
Moses and Aaron caused the land to be full of gnats
16 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Tell Aaron to strike the ground with his stick.
When he does that, all the fine particles of ground/dust will become gnats, all over
17 So they/we did that. Aaron struck the ground with his stick, and all over Egypt,
their animals.
to do it. So the gnats stayed on the Egyptian people and on their animals.
his power [MTY]!” But the king continued to be stubborn [IDM], and he would not
pay attention to us, just as Yahweh had predicted.
Moses and Aaron caused the land to be filled with flies
20 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Get up early tomorrow morning.
Go down to
the river and wait for the king. When he comes to bathe [MTY], say to him, ‘This is
what Yahweh says to you: “Let my people go, in order that they may worship me in
the desert.
21 I warn you that if you do not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies to you.
They will come down on you and on your officials and on the rest of your people. The
houses of all you Egyptians will be full of flies. They will even cover the ground.
22 But when that happens, I will treat the Goshen region, where my people live,
differently. There will be no swarms of flies there. In that way, you will know that I,
Yahweh, am doing these things here in this land.
23 I will distinguish clearly between how I act toward my people and how I act
toward your people. And this plague is going to happen tomorrow!” ’ ”
24 Early the next morning, Moses/I told that to the king, but the king would not pay
any attention. So Yahweh did what he said he would do. He sent great swarms of flies
into the palace of the king and into the houses of his officials. The whole country of
Egypt was ruined by the flies.
25 Then the king summoned Aaron and Moses/me and said, “You Israeli people can
go and offer sacrifices to your god, but you must do it here in this land.”
26 But Moses/I replied, “It would not be right for us to do that, because we will be
offering sacrifices that are very offensive to the Egyptian people. If we offer sacrifices
that the Egyptian people think are disgusting, they will kill us by throwing stones at
us [RHQ]!
27 No, we need to travel for three days into the desert. There we will offer sacrifices
to Yahweh, the God we worship, just as he commands (OR, has commanded) us.”
28 So the king said, “I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to Yahweh, your god,
in the desert. But you must not go very far. Now pray for me!”
29 Moses/I said, “Listen to me! After I leave you, I will pray to Yahweh, asking that
tomorrow he will cause the swarms of flies to leave you and your officials and the
rest of your people. But do not deceive us again by refusing to let our people go to
offer sacrifices to Yahweh!”
30 Then Moses/I left the king and prayed to Yahweh.
31 And Yahweh did what Moses/I asked, and he got rid of the swarms of flies from
around the king and his officials and the rest of his people. No flies remained.
EXODUS 8:32

EXODUS 9:16
32 But the king was stubborn [IDM] this time also, and he did not allow the Israeli
people to go.

Yahweh sent a terrible disease to afflict the Egyptians’ livestock
1 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Go to the king and say to him, ‘This is what
Yahweh, the God we Hebrews worship, says: “Allow my people to go, in order that
they may worship me.
2 If you still keep refusing to let them go [DOU],
3 I warn you that I will punish you with my power [MTY] by sending a terrible
disease on all your animals—on your horses, donkeys, camels, on your cattle, and on
your flocks of sheep and goats.
4 But I, Yahweh, will distinguish between what I do to the animals that belong to
the Israeli people and what I do to your animals. The result will be that no animal
that belongs to the Israeli people will die.” ’
5 Tell him that I have determined/decided that tomorrow is the day that I will do
this in this land.”
6 The next day Yahweh did just what he said that he would do. A terrible disease
afflicted all of the Egyptians’ animals, and many of them [HYP] died. But none of the
Israeli people’s animals died.
7 The king sent men to investigate, and they were surprised to see that none of
the Israeli people’s animals had died. But after they reported that to the king, he
continued to be stubborn [IDM], and he did not let the Israeli people go.
Yahweh caused the Egyptian people to be afflicted with boils
8 Then Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses/me, “Take a few handfuls of ashes/soot
from ◄a furnace/an oven where they burn lime►, and let Moses throw them up into
the air, in front of the king.
9 The ashes/soot will spread all over the country of Egypt like fine dust. And the
ashes/soot will cause boils to afflict both the Egyptian people and their animals, all
over the land.”
10 So they/we both got some ashes/soot and went and stood in front of the king.
Moses/I threw the ashes/soot up into the air. The ashes/soot spread all over, causing
boils to afflict the Egyptian people and their animals. All the boils became open sores.
11 Even the men who worked magic had boils. The result was that they were
who worked magic had boils just like all the rest of the Egyptian people.
12 But Yahweh caused the king to continue to be stubborn [IDM]. He did not pay any
attention to what they/we said, just as Yahweh had told Moses/me would happen.
Yahweh sent hail on all the Egyptian people and their animals
13 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Get up early tomorrow morning. Go and stand
in front of the king and tell him that Yahweh God, the one that the Hebrew people
worship, says this: ‘Let my people go, in order that they may worship me in the desert.
14 If you do not let them go, this time I will punish with plagues not only your officials
and the rest of your people, but I will punish you yourself [SYN], in order that you
will know there is no god like me anywhere in the world.
with terrible diseases that would have wiped you all from the earth.
with the result that people all over the earth [HYP] will know how great I [MTY] am.
EXODUS 9:17
98
EXODUS 9:35
17 You are still acting proudly and refusing to let my people go.
18 So listen to this: About this time tomorrow I will cause very heavy hail to fall in
Egypt. From the time Egypt first became a country, there has never been a hailstorm
as bad as this one will be.
19 So you should send a message to everyone to put their cattle, and everything else
that they own that is out in the fields, under shelters. The hail will fall on every
person and every animal that is out in the fields and that is not put under a shelter,
and they will all die.’ ” So Moses/I did what Yahweh said.
20 Some of the king’s officials who heard what Yahweh had said became very afraid.
So they put all their animals and their slaves under shelters.
21 But those who did not pay any attention to what Yahweh had said left their slaves
and their animals in the fields.
22 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Raise your hand up toward the sky, in order
that hail will fall all over the land of Egypt—on the people and on their animals and
on all the plants in the fields.”
23 So Moses/I lifted his/my stick up toward the sky. And Yahweh sent down hail, all
over the land of Egypt. There was also thunder and lightning.
24 While very heavy hail was falling, there was thunder, and lightning struck the
ground. There had never been a hailstorm like that since Egypt first became a country.
25 The hail struck everything that was in the fields all over Egypt—every person
and every animal. The hail destroyed the plants in the fields and stripped the leaves
off the trees.
26 Only in the Goshen region, where the Israeli people were living, was there no
hail.
27 Then the king sent someone to summon Aaron and Moses/me. When they/we
came to the king, he said to them/us, “This time I admit that I have sinned. What
Yahweh has done is right, and what I and my people have done is wrong.
28 ◄Pray to/Plead with► Yahweh to cause it to stop! We cannot endure any more of
this thunder and hail! I will let your people go; they do not have to stay here in Egypt
any longer.”
29 Moses/I replied, “As soon as I go out of this city, I will lift up my hands and pray
to Yahweh. Then the thunder will cease, and no more hail will fall. This will happen
in order that you will know that Yahweh, not your gods, controls everything that
happens on the earth.
30 But as for you and your officials, I know that you do not yet fear Yahweh God.”
31 When the hail fell, the flax was ruined because the buds were forming, and the
barley was ruined because its grain was ripe.
32 But none of the wheat crops was ruined, because their shoots were still very
small.
33 So Moses/I left the king and went outside the city. He/I lifted up his/my hands
toward Yahweh and prayed. Then the thunder and the hail stopped, and the rain also
stopped falling on the land of Egypt.
34 But when the king saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had stopped,
he sinned again. He and his officials continued to be stubborn [IDM].
35 So, just as Yahweh had predicted by what he told Moses/me, the king did not
allow the Israeli people to leave.
10
Yahweh sent locusts to destroy the rest of the Egyptians’ crops
EXODUS 10:1
99
EXODUS 10:15
1 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Go to the king again. I have made him and his
officials stubborn [IDM]. I have done that in order that I would have a good reason to
perform all these plagues among them,
2 and also in order that you would be able to tell your children and your
grandchildren how I caused the Egyptians to act very foolishly when I performed
all these miracles. Then all of you will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do
what I say that I will do.”
3 So Aaron and Moses/I went into the king’s palace and said to him, “Yahweh God,
whom we Hebrews worship, says this: ‘How long will you stubbornly refuse to do
what I tell you [MTY]? Let my people go, in order that they may worship me in the
desert
4 If you keep refusing to let them go, I warn you that tomorrow I will bring
◄locusts/large flying insects called locusts► into your country.
5 They will completely cover the ground so that you will not even be able to see the
ground. They will eat everything that the hail did not destroy. They will eat everything
that is left on the trees.
6 They will fill your houses, and the houses of all your officials, and the houses of
all the rest of the Egyptians. There will be more locusts than you or your parents or
your grandparents have ever seen, from the time your ancestors first came to this
land until the present time!’ ” Then he/I turned and Aaron and I left the king.
7 The king’s officials said to him, “◄How long is this man going to continue to bring
disasters on us?/We must not let this man continue to cause trouble for us!► [RHQ]
Let the Israeli men leave, in order that they may worship Yahweh, their god. ◄Do
you not yet understand that this man has ruined Egypt?/You ought to realize by now
that this man has ruined Egypt!►” [RHQ]
8 So they brought Aaron and Moses/me back to the king. He said to them/us, “All
right, you can go and worship Yahweh your god. But who are the ones who will go?”
9 Moses/I replied, “We all need to go, everyone, including those who are young
and those who are old. We need to take our sons and our daughters and our flocks
of sheep and goats and herds of livestock, because we must have a festival to honor
Yahweh.”
10 Moses/I really did not intend that the Israelis would ever return to Egypt, and the
king knew that also. So the king replied sarcastically, “If you all leave, it will be clear
your wives when you go! It is clear that you are wickedly planning not to return.
that is what you want.” Then the king expelled them/us from his palace.
stretching it over the land to welcome the locusts. They will come to the country
of Egypt and eat every plant that is left in the land, every plant that the hail has not
destroyed.”
13 So Moses/I held out his/my stick as though he/I was stretching it over the whole
land of Egypt. Then Yahweh caused a strong wind to blow from the east, and it blew
over the land all that day and all that night. By the next morning, it had brought the
locusts.
14 The locusts swarmed all over Egypt. It was larger than any swarm of locusts that
had ever been seen, and there will never be a swarm of locusts like that again.
15 They covered the surface of the ground and made it appear black. They ate all
the plants in the land and everything on the trees that had not been destroyed by the
hail. Nothing that was green was left on any plant or on any tree, anywhere in Egypt.
EXODUS 10:16
100
EXODUS 11:5
16 The king quickly summoned Aaron and Moses/me and said, “I have sinned against
Yahweh, your god, and against you two.
17 So now I ask you to forgive me this one time for having sinned, and pray to
Yahweh your god to stop these locusts [MTY] from causing everything to die.”
18 They/We left the king, and Moses/I prayed to Yahweh.
19 Then Yahweh changed the wind so that it blew strongly from the west, and it
blew all the locusts into the Red Sea (OR, the Gulf of Suez). There was not one locust
left anywhere in the country of Egypt.
20 But Yahweh made the king stubborn [IDM] again, and he did not let the Israeli
people go.
Yahweh caused a great darkness to cover Egypt
21 Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Reach your hand up toward the sky, in order that
there will be darkness over all the land of Egypt, a darkness so complete that people
will have to grope around to know where to walk.”
22 So Moses/I reached his/my hand toward the sky, and it became totally dark all
over Egypt for three days and nights.
23 People could not see each other. No one left his house during that whole time.
But there was light in the area where the Israeli people were living.
24 The king summoned Moses/me and said, “All right, you may go and worship
Yahweh. Your wives and your children may go with you. But your flocks of sheep
and goats and your herds of cattle must remain here.”
25 But Moses/I replied, “No, you must let us take along the sheep and goats, in order
that we may have some of them to sacrifice and give as burned offerings to Yahweh,
our God.
26 Our livestock must also go with us; we are not going to leave one of them [SYN]
behind. We must take them to worship Yahweh. We will not know which animals to
27 But Yahweh made the king continue to be stubborn [IDM], and he would not let
28 The king said to me, “Get out of here! Make sure that you never come to see me
[SYN] again! The day you see me again, I will have you executed!”
Yahweh declared that all the oldest sons of the Egyptians would die, and then the
1 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “I will cause one more disaster to strike the king
of Egypt and all his people [MTY]. After that, he will let you leave. In fact, he will
expel you all.
2 So now speak to all the Israeli people. Tell them to ask all their Egyptian neighbors,
both men and women, to give them some silver and gold jewelry.”
3 Yahweh made the Egyptians highly respect the Israeli people. In particular, the
Egyptian officials and all the rest of the people considered Moses/me to be a very great
man.
4 Then Moses/ I went to the king and said, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘About
midnight tonight I will go throughout Egypt,
5 and I will cause all the firstborn/oldest sons to die. That will include your oldest
son, the oldest sons of the slave women who grind grain, and the oldest sons of
everyone else. I will also kill the oldest males of the Egyptians’ livestock.
EXODUS 11:6
101
EXODUS 12:14
6 When that happens, people all over Egypt will wail loudly. They have never wailed
like that before, and they will never wail like that again.
7 But among the Israeli people it will be so quiet that not even a dog will bark! Then
you will know for sure that I, Yahweh, distinguish how I act toward the Egyptians
and how I act toward the Israeli people.
8 Then all these officials of yours will come and bow down before me and will
say, “Please get out of Egypt, you and all the Israeli people!” ’ After that, I will leave
Egypt!” After Moses/I said that, he/I very angrily left the king.
9 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “The king will not pay any attention to what you
say. The result will be that I will perform more plagues in the land of Egypt.”
10 Aaron and Moses/I performed all these miracles in front of the king, but Yahweh
made the king stubborn, and he did not let the Israeli people leave his country.
12
Yahweh instructed Moses and Aaron about the Passover Festival
1 Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses/me there in Egypt,
2 “From now on, this month will be the first month of the year for you.
3 Tell all the Israeli people that in each family, the man who heads the family must
select a lamb or a young goat for his household.
4 If there are not enough people in his family to eat a whole cooked lamb, then his
family and the family that lives next door may share one animal. Decide how many
lambs you need according to the number of people in each family, and according to
how much each person can eat.
5 The lambs or goats that you choose must be males, one-year-old, and they must
not have any defects.
6 You must take special care of these animals until the 14th day of the month. On
that day, all the Israeli people must slaughter the lambs or goats in the evening.
smear it on the doorposts and the ◄lintels/horizontal beams above the doorways► of
8 They must roast the animals immediately and eat the meat that night. They must
9 You must not eat any of the meat raw, and you must not boil the meat. You must
roast it whole, without cutting off the head or the legs or removing the internal parts.
10 You must eat all the meat that evening; do not let any of the meat remain to be
eaten the next morning. If any of the meat is left until the next morning, you must
completely burn it.
11 When you eat it, you must be dressed ready to travel, and you must eat it quickly.
You must have your sandals on your feet and your walking stick in your hands. It
will be a festival called Passover to honor me, Yahweh.
12 On that night I will go through all the country of Egypt, and I will kill all the
oldest males in Egypt, both humans and animals. By doing this I will show that all
the gods in Egypt are worthless. I can do this, because I am Yahweh, the all-powerful
God.
13 The blood that you smear on the doorways will be a mark to indicate the houses in
which you Israelis live. When I see the blood, I will ignore and pass by those houses,
and I will not harm you Israelis who live there, when I punish the Egyptians.
14 Each year, you must celebrate this festival on this day, to remember what I,
Yahweh, have done for you. In all the generations to come, each year you must
celebrate this festival. It must continue forever.
EXODUS 12:15
102
EXODUS 12:30
15 For seven days you must eat bread that has no yeast in it. On the first day of that
week you must get rid of all the yeast that is in your houses. During those seven days,
if anyone eats bread that is baked with yeast in it, you must consider that person to
be no longer an Israeli.
16 On the first day of that week, you must ◄have a holy meeting/gather together to
worship me►. You must do the same thing on the seventh day. People must not work
on those two days. The only work they may do is to prepare food for you to eat.
17 Every year you must keep celebrating this festival of eating bread that has no
yeast in it, because it will remind you that it was on this day that I brought all your
tribal groups out of Egypt. So every year, in all the generations to come, you must
celebrate this day as a festival. It must continue forever.
18-19 In the first month of the year, on the 14th day of that month, the only bread
you may eat is bread that has no yeast in it. You must keep doing that each day until
the 21st day of that month. For those seven days you must not have any yeast in your
house. During that time, if anyone, either an Israeli or a foreigner, eats bread made
with yeast, you must consider that person no longer to be an Israeli.
20 In your houses, do not eat anything that has yeast in it during those seven days.”
21 Then Moses/I summoned all the leaders of the Israeli people. He/I said to them,
“Each family should select a lamb and kill it, in order that you may eat it to celebrate
the festival that will be called ‘Passover’.
22 Let the lamb’s blood drain into a basin. Get a bunch/sprig of ◄hyssop/a very leafy
plant► and dip it in the blood. Then smear some of the blood on the doorposts and
the ◄lintels/beams above the doorways► of your houses. The people in each house
must all stay inside the house until the next morning.
23 When Yahweh goes throughout Egypt to kill the oldest male in each Egyptian
ignore and pass by those houses. He will not allow the angel who causes people to
24 You and your descendants must celebrate this festival forever.
25 And when you arrive in the land that Yahweh will be giving to you as he promised,
you must keep celebrating this ritual every year.
26 When your children ask you, ‘What does this ritual mean?’,
27 you must tell them, ‘This ritual is to remember how our ancestors sacrificed lambs
on the night that Yahweh’s angel passed by the houses of the Israeli people when they
were in Egypt. He killed the oldest males/sons in all the Egyptian houses, but he
spared the sons in [MTY] our houses.’ ” After Moses/I told them this, they all bowed
their heads and worshiped Yahweh.
28 Then the Israeli people did what Yahweh had told Aaron and Moses/me to tell
them to do.
Yahweh killed all the oldest Egyptian males
29 At midnight Yahweh killed all the oldest sons of the Egyptian people, all over
Egypt. That included the king’s oldest son, the oldest sons of the prisoners in the
dungeon/jail, and the oldest sons of everyone else. He also killed the oldest males of
all the Egyptians’ livestock.
30 That night the king, all his officials, and all the rest of the Egyptian people awoke
and discovered what had happened. They wailed loudly all over Egypt, because in
every house, someone’s son had died.
The Israeli people left Egypt
EXODUS 12:31
103
EXODUS 12:51
31 That night the king summoned Aaron and Moses/me and said, “You and all the
other Israeli people, must leave my country immediately! Go and worship Yahweh,
as you requested!
32 Take your flocks of sheep and goats and herds of cattle, and leave! And ask
Yahweh to bless me, also!”
33 Then the Israeli people did as Moses/I had told them. They went to their Egyptian
neighbors and asked them for silver and gold jewelry and clothing.
34 Yahweh caused the Egyptian people to greatly respect the Israeli people, so they
gave them what they asked for. In that way, they carried away the wealth of the
Egyptian people.
35 The Egyptians urged the Israeli people to leave their country quickly. They said,
“If you do not do that, we will all die!”
36 So the Israeli people prepared to leave at once. They took the bowls in which they
mixed the dough to make bread, and the dough that was in the bowls without any
yeast in it, and they wrapped the bowls in their cloaks. They put the bowls on their
shoulders and left.
37 The Israeli people traveled from Rameses city to Succoth town. There were about
600,000 men who went, in addition to the women and children.
38 Many other people who were not Israelis went along with them. There were also
livestock, the flocks of sheep and goats and herds of cattle.
39 On their way, they baked bread with the dough that they carried with them when
they had been expelled from Egypt. The dough did not have yeast in it, because they
ready to take with them, or enough time to mix yeast in the dough.
41 On the day that those 430 years ended, on that very day, all the tribes of Yahweh’s
people left Egypt.
42 It was a night when Yahweh ◄protected/guarded over► them as he brought them
out of Egypt. So this same night every year is a night that is dedicated to Yahweh, a
night when the Israeli people in every generation remember how Yahweh protected
our ancestors.
Yahweh instructed Moses and Aaron about future Passover festivals
43-44 Then Yahweh said this to Aaron and Moses/me: “These are my instructions
about the Passover ritual: Do not let foreigners eat the Passover meal. But any male
slaves that you have bought may eat it after you have circumcised them.
45 Do not let people who are living among you temporarily, or servants whom you
have hired, eat the Passover meal.
46 Each family must eat the Passover meal inside their own house. Do not take any
of the food outside the house. And do not break any of the bones of the lamb that is
sacrificed.
47 All the Israeli people must celebrate this festival.
48 When someone from another country comes to live with you and wants to
celebrate the Passover Festival, circumcise all the males in his household. Then they
may eat the Passover meal, and you should treat those people as though they were
born as Israelis. But do not allow men who have not been circumcised to eat the
Passover meal.
49 These rules apply to people who were born as Israelis and to foreigners who
come and live among you.”
50 All the Israeli people obeyed Aaron and Moses/me and did what Yahweh had
commanded.
51 On that very day Yahweh brought all the tribes of the Israeli people out of Egypt.

Yahweh gave Moses instructions about dedicating the firstborn sons
1 Yahweh said to Moses/me,
2 “Set apart all the firstborn males in order that they may belong to me.
firstborn males of the Israeli people and of their animals will be mine.”
The
Moses instructed them about future celebrations of the Festival of Unleavened Bread
This is the day that you are
leaving Egypt. This is the day you are freed from being their slaves. Yahweh has
brought you out of Egypt by his great power [MTY]. Do not eat any bread that has
yeast in it whenever you celebrate this day.
4 You are leaving Egypt on this day, which is the first day of the month that is named
5 Later, when Yahweh brings you into the land where the descendants of Canaan,
you, a land that will be very good for raising livestock and growing crops [MTY], you
6 For seven days the bread that you eat must not have any yeast in it. On the seventh
day there must be a festival to honor Yahweh.
7 For seven days do not eat bread that has yeast in it. You should not have any yeast
or bread made with yeast anywhere in your land.
8 On the day the festival starts, you must tell your children, ‘We are doing this to
remember what Yahweh did for our ancestors when they left Egypt.
9 This ritual will remind you how Yahweh brought your ancestors out of Egypt with
his great power [MTY]. The ritual will be like something you tie on your forehead or
on your wrist. It will remind you to recite to others what Yahweh has instructed you.
10 So you must celebrate this festival every year at the time Yahweh has appointed.’
11 Yahweh will bring you into the land where the descendants of Canaan live, just
as he promised you and your ancestors that he would do. When he gives that land
to you,
12 you must dedicate to Yahweh the firstborn males of all your animals. These all
will belong to Yahweh.
sacrificing a lamb as a substitute for the donkey. If you do not want to buy back
the donkey, you must kill it by breaking its neck. You must also buy back every one
of your own firstborn sons.
14 In the future, when one of your children asks, ‘What does this mean?’, you must
say to him, ‘Yahweh brought our ancestors out of Egypt with his great power [MTY],
and freed us from being slaves there.
15 The king of Egypt stubbornly refused to let them leave his country, so Yahweh
killed all the firstborn males in Egypt, both the boys and the firstborn of their
livestock. That is why we now sacrifice to Yahweh all the firstborn of our livestock,
but we buy back our own firstborn sons.’
16 I repeat that this ritual will remind you about how Yahweh brought our ancestors
out of Egypt by his great power [MTY]; it will be like something you tie on your wrist
or on your forehead to remind you of that.”
3 Moses/I said to the people, “Do not forget this day!
God led them to detour through the desert
17 When the king of Egypt let the Israeli people go, God did not lead them to go
through the land of the Philistines. That was a shorter way, but God said, “It would
EXODUS 13:18
105
EXODUS 14:10
be bad if my people change their minds when they realize that they will have to fight
the Philistines to take their land, and then decide to return to Egypt.”
18 Instead, God led them to go around through the desert toward the Red Sea (OR,
the Gulf of Suez). When the Israeli people left Egypt, they were carrying weapons to
fight their enemies.
19 Moses/I had them take along the bones of Joseph with them/us, because Joseph
long ago had made the Israeli people promise solemnly that they would do that. He
happens, you must carry my bones with you.”
and they set up their tents there.
21 When they traveled during the daytime, Yahweh went in front of them in a tall
white cloud to show them the way. During the night, he went in front of them in a tall
cloud that looked like a fire. By doing that, he enabled them to travel in the daytime
and also at nighttime.
22 The tall cloud did not leave them. It was always in front of them, as a bright
white cloud in the daytime and like a fire at night.
14
Yahweh told Moses what he planned to do
1 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me,
2 “Tell the Israeli people to turn around and go back and set up their tents in front of
Pi-Hahiroth town. That town is between Migdol and the sea, across from Baal-Zephon
town. Set up your tents there, close to the sea.
3 When the king knows you have done that, he will think, ‘The Israeli people are
confused. They are wandering around, and the desert blocks their path.’
4 But I will make the king stubborn again, and he will take his army and pursue
you. Then my people will praise/thank me for winning a victory over the king and
his army. And the Egyptians will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I
say that I will do.” So Moses/I told my people that, and they did what he/I told them
to do.
The Egyptian army started to pursue the Israelis
5 When someone told the king that the Israeli people had left during the night, he
and his officials changed their minds and said, “◄What have we done?/What we have
done was stupid!► [RHQ] The Israeli people will no longer be our slaves!”
6 So the king got his chariot and his army ready.
7 Then he selected 600 of the best chariots, and in each chariot he placed a driver,
a soldier, and a commander, and they left. Other chariots, with a driver and a soldier
in each of them, also went along.
8 Because Yahweh made the king of Egypt so stubborn that he and his army went
to pursue the Israelis, who were leaving triumphantly,
9 the Egyptian army, with all the king’s horses and chariots and horsemen, pursued
the Israelis. They caught up with them as they were camped near the sea, close to
Pi-Hahiroth, in front of Baal-Zephon town.
10 When the king’s army got near, the Israeli people were surprised to see that the
Egyptians were marching toward them. They were terrified; so they cried out to
Yahweh to help them.
EXODUS 14:11
106
EXODUS 14:28
11 Then they said to Moses/me, “Is it because there were no places in Egypt where
we could be buried that you have brought us here to die in this desert [RHQ]? Look
what you have done to us by bringing us out of Egypt [RHQ]!
12 That is what we told you when we were in Egypt! We said, ‘Leave us alone, and
for the Egyptians than to die here in the desert!”
will rescue you! He will save you today, and the result will be that the Egyptians that
14 Yahweh will fight for you! Just keep quiet. There is nothing else that you will
have to do.”
Yahweh caused the Egyptian army to drown in the sea
15-16 Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Tell the people to stop crying out for me to help
them, and tell them to go forward. Lift up your stick and stretch it out toward the
sea. The water will divide, so that all you Israeli people can go in the middle of the
sea, walking on dry ground.
17 I will make the Egyptians stubborn, so that they will try to follow you. And
then as a result of what I will do to the king and his army and his chariots and his
horsemen, my people will praise/thank me.
18 And when I have won a glorious victory over the king and his chariots and his
horsemen, the other Egyptians will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what
I say that I will do.”
19 Then the angel of God, who had been in front of the Israeli people, moved and
went behind them. The tall bright cloud that had been in front of them also moved
behind them,
20 until it was between the Egyptian army and the Israeli people. The cloud caused
the Egyptian army to be in the dark but it gave light for the Israelis. As a result,
neither group could come near the other group during the whole night.
21 That evening, Moses/I stretched out his/my hand toward the sea. Then Yahweh
sent a strong wind from the east. It blew all night and pushed the water apart, and
it caused the ground between the water to dry up.
22 Then we Israeli people went on the dry land in the middle of the sea. The water
was like a wall on each side of us, on the right side and on the left side.
23 Then the Egyptian army pursued them, and went after them into the middle of
the sea, with their horses and their chariots and the chariot-drivers.
24 Just before dawn, Yahweh looked down from the fiery cloud, and then he caused
the Egyptian army to panic.
25 He caused the wheels of the chariots to get stuck in the mud, so that they could
hardly move. So the Egyptians said, “Yahweh is fighting for the Israelis and against
us; let’s get out of here!”
26 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Stretch out your arm toward the sea again. Then
the water will come back on the Egyptians and on their chariots and their horsemen.”
27 So Moses/ I stretched out his/ my arm, and as the sun was rising, the water
returned to its normal level. The Egyptians tried to escape, but Yahweh hurled them
back into the sea.
28 The water returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen and the whole
Egyptian army that had tried to follow us Israelis into the sea. Every one of the
Egyptians drowned.
EXODUS 14:29
107
EXODUS 15:11
29 But we Israeli people had already crossed through the sea by walking on dry
ground, with the water being like two walls, one on the right side and one on the left
30 That is the way Yahweh saved the Israeli people from the Egyptian army on that
the shore.
31 The Israelis saw what Yahweh did to the Egyptians by his great power [MTY], and
they were in awe of Yahweh. They trusted in Yahweh and they also trusted Moses/
me.
15
The Israelis celebrated being rescued
1 Then Moses/I sang this song, and the Israeli people sang with him:
“I will sing to Yahweh, because he has triumphed gloriously;
He has thrown the horses and their riders into the sea!
2 Yahweh is the one who makes me strong, and he is the one I sing about.
He is the one who has saved me.
He is ◄my God/God, the one I worship►, and I will praise him.
He is the one my father worshiped,
and I will tell others how great he is.
3 Yahweh is a warrior;
Yahweh is his name.
4 He has thrown the king’s chariots and his army
into the sea;
His best officers
all drowned in the Red Sea (OR, Gulf of Suez).
5 The water covered them like a flood;
6 O Yahweh, your right arm has awesome power;
with that power [MTY], O Yahweh, you have crushed/smashed the enemy into
pieces.
7 You have gloriously defeated your enemies.
Because you were angry with them, you have destroyed them
like a fire burns up straw [SIM].
8 You blew on the sea,
and the water piled up high;
the water stood up like two walls.
In the deepest part of the sea the water became thick/solid,
as though it was frozen.
9 Our enemies said, ‘We will pursue them
and catch up to them.
We will draw our swords
and strike them.
After we defeat them,
we will divide up the spoils.
We will take from them all we want.’
10 But you blew on them with your breath,
and then the sea covered them.
They sank like lead/rocks in the big waves.
11 Yahweh, among their gods, there is no god like you [RHQ]!
You are glorious, completely different from all that you made.
◄There is no god like you!/What god is like you?► [RHQ]
There is no one who can perform all kinds of miracles [DOU] like you do [RHQ]!
12 When you stretched out your right hand,
the earth swallowed up our enemies
13 You faithfully loved the people you rescued;
with your power you are leading them to the land that you have set apart.
14 The people of other nations will hear what you have done;
and they will tremble.
The people in Philistia will be terrified.
15 The chiefs in Edom will be dismayed.
The leaders in Moab will be so afraid, they will shake. All those who live in
Canaan will faint.
16 They will be terrified and fearful because of your great strength [MTY].
But they will be as silent as stones
until your people march past them,
the people you freed from being slaves in Egypt,
17 to go to Canaan land.
You will enable them to live [MET] on your hill,
at the place that you, O Yahweh, have chosen to be your home,
in the ◄holy place/temple►
that you yourself will build.
18 O Yahweh, you will rule forever!
19 The Israeli people walked through the middle of the sea on dry ground. But when
the king’s horses and chariots and horsemen tried to go through the sea, Yahweh
caused the water to come back and cover them.”
20 Then Miriam, who was Aaron’s older sister and a ◄prophetess/woman who spoke
messages that came directly from God►, picked up her tambourine,
21 and she sang this song to Yahweh:
“Sing to Yahweh,
because he has triumphed gloriously over his enemies.
He has thrown the horses and their riders into the sea.”
Yahweh made bitter water become good water to drink
22 Then Moses/I led the Israeli people away from the Red Sea (OR, Gulf of Suez).
They/we went to the desert at Shur. They/We walked for three days, but they/we
could not find any water.
23 So they/we went on and came to a place named Marah. There was water there, but
they/we could not drink it, because it was bitter. That is why they named the place
Marah, which is the Hebrew word that means ‘bitter’.
24 The people complained to Moses/me, saying, “What are we going to drink?”
25 So Moses/I prayed earnestly to Yahweh. Then Yahweh showed him/me a tree. So
he/I cut off one of the branches and threw it into the water, and the water became
good to drink. There at Marah, Yahweh gave them various laws to direct their lives.
He also tested them there, to determine if they would obey him,
26 by saying, “I am Yahweh, your God. If you will carefully obey me when I speak
things that I command you, I will keep you from being afflicted by all the diseases
27 After they/we left Marah, they/we came to a place named Elim. There were twelve
EXODUS 16:1
109
EXODUS 16:17
16
Yahweh gave them quail and manna to eat
1 They/We left Elim, and all the Israeli people came to the desert named Sin. That is
between Elim and Sinai Mountain. That was on the fifteenth day of the second month
after they/we left Egypt.
2 There in the desert, the Israeli [HYP] people complained to Aaron and Moses/me.
3 They said to them/us, “We wish that Yahweh had killed us in Egypt! There we
had meat to eat, and all the bread that we wanted. But you have brought us into this
desert in order that we will all starve to death!”
4 Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Listen to what I am going to do. I am going to send
something from the sky that will take the place of bread for all of you. When I do
that, the people must go out of their tents every day and gather just enough to eat on
that day. When I do that, I will find out whether they will obey my instructions or
not.
5 On the sixth day after I start doing that, they will be able to gather twice as much
as on the other days, and not have to gather any on the seventh day. Then they can
prepare it to eat it on the 6th and 7th days.”
6 So Aaron and Moses/I said to all the Israeli people, “This evening you will know
that it was Yahweh, not we, who brought you out of Egypt.
7 And tomorrow morning you will see how great Yahweh is, because he has heard
what you have complained about. He is the one whom you have really complained
to, because we are just his servants.” [RHQ]
8 Then Moses/I also said, “From now on, each evening Yahweh will give you meat
to eat, and each morning he will give you something that will take the place of bread,
because he has heard what you have complained about. Yahweh is the one to whom
you have really complained, not us. We are just his servants.” [RHQ]
9 Then Moses/I said to Aaron, “Tell all the Israeli people, ‘Come and stand here
in the presence of Yahweh, because he has heard what you have been complaining
about.’ ”
10 So Aaron told them that. And as Aaron was talking to all the Israeli people, they
looked toward the desert, and were surprised to see the ◄dazzling light/incredible
brightness► of Yahweh in the cloud that had been leading them.
11 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me,
12 “I have heard what the Israeli people have been complaining about. So say to
them, ‘From now on, each evening, you will have meat to eat. And each morning you
will have something that will take the place of bread. You will have all you want of
it to eat.’ Then you will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I
will do.”
13 That evening, ◄quails/small plump birds► appeared, and there were so many
that they covered the campsite. The next morning there was something like dew all
14 When the dew evaporated, on the surface of the desert there was a thick layer
15 When the Israeli people saw it, since they had never seen it before and did not
is something Yahweh has given you to eat, to take the place of bread.
16 This is what Yahweh has commanded: ‘Each of you should gather as much as
you need to eat. Gather two quarts/liters for each person who lives in your tents.’ ”
17 So that is what the Israeli people did. Some gathered more and some gathered
less.
EXODUS 16:18
110
EXODUS 17:1
18 But when they measured what they had gathered, those that had gathered a lot
did not have anything left over. And those that gathered less still had enough to eat.
Each person gathered just what they needed.
19 Moses/I said to them, “Do not leave any of it to eat tomorrow morning!”
20 But some of them did not pay any attention to what Moses/I said. They kept some
of it until the next morning. But it was full of maggots and smelled rotten. And that
made Moses/me angry.
21 Each morning they gathered as much as they needed. But later, when the sun
got hot, what was left on the ground melted.
22 On the sixth day after they started gathering it, each person was able to gather
four quarts/liters, which was twice as much as they gathered on the other days. When
the leaders of the people came to Moses/me and told him/me about that,
23 Moses/I said to them, “This is what Yahweh has commanded: ‘Tomorrow will be
a day for you to rest completely. It will be a day dedicated to Yahweh. So today, bake
or boil what you will need for today and for tomorrow. Whatever is left this evening,
you should put aside and keep it to eat tomorrow.’ ”
24 So they did what Moses/I commanded. What was left over, they kept until the
next day. It did not spoil and did not get maggots in it!
25 On that day, Moses/I said, “Eat today what you have saved from yesterday, because
today is a day dedicated to Yahweh. Today you will not find any of that food outside.
26 Every week, you must gather it for six days; but on the seventh day, which will
be a day of rest, you will not find any.”
27 On the seventh day, some of the people went outside their tents to gather some
of that food, but there was none.
28 Then Yahweh told Moses/me to say this to the people: “How long will you people
refuse to do all the things that I tell you?
29 Listen! Yahweh has given you a day of rest. So on the sixth day of each week, he
will be giving you enough of this food for two days. Each of you should stay in his
tent and do no work on the seventh day!”
30 So the people rested on the seventh day.
31 The Israeli people called this food manna, which sounds like the words in their
language that mean ‘what is it?’ It looked like small seeds called coriander, but it was
white, and it tasted like thin wafers/biscuits made with honey.
32 Moses/I said, “This is what Yahweh has commanded: ‘You must keep two quarts/
liters of it for all future generations, so that they can see the food that took the place
33 And he/I said to Aaron, “Take a jar, and put two quarts of manna in it. Then put it
34 Many years later, as Yahweh had commanded Moses/me, Aaron put the jar in
front of the box that contained the stone slabs on which the Ten Commandments were
written.
35 The Israeli people were able to eat manna every day for 40 years, until they came
to the border of Canaan land.
36 (The standard measure that they used at that time held 20 quarts/liters.)
17
Yahweh provided water gushing from a rock
1 Obeying what Yahweh commanded, all the Israeli people moved from the Sin
Desert. They/We traveled from one place to another. They/We camped at a place
named Rephidim, but there was no water there for ◄the people/us► to drink.
EXODUS 17:2
111
EXODUS 17:16
2 So the people complained to Moses/me again, saying, “Give us water to drink!”
Moses/I replied to them, “Why are you ◄criticizing/arguing with► me [RHQ]? And
why are you trying to determine whether Yahweh has the power to provide for you?”
3 But the people were very thirsty, and they continued to complain to Moses/me.
They were saying things like “Why did you bring us out of Egypt?”, and “Did you
bring us here to cause us and our children and livestock to die ◄from thirst/because
we had no water to drink► [RHQ]?”
4 So Moses/I prayed earnestly to Yahweh. He/I said, “◄How shall I deal with these
people?/I do not know how to deal with these people!► [RHQ] They are almost ready
to kill me by throwing stones at me!”
5 Yahweh replied to Moses/me, “Take some of the elders/leaders of the Israeli people
with you and tell the rest of the people to follow you to Sinai Mountain. Take along
the stick with which you struck the Nile River.
6 Listen carefully: I will stand in front of you on top of a large rock at the foot of the
mountain. Strike the rock with your stick. When you do that, water for the people to
drink will flow out of the rock.” When they/we arrived at the mountain, Moses/I did
that while the Israeli elders were watching, and water flowed from the rock.
7 Moses/I gave that place two names in the Hebrew language: Massah, which means
‘testing’, and Meribah, which means ‘complaining’. He/I gave it the name Massah
because the Israeli people were testing Yahweh, saying “Is Yahweh really among us
and able to help us, or not?”, and he/I gave it the name Meribah because they were
continually complaining.
God enabled the Israeli men to defeat the Amalekites
8 Then the descendants of the Amalek people-group came and fought against the
Israeli people at Rephidim.
men to go out and fight against the Amalek people-group tomorrow. I will stand on
10 So Joshua did what Moses/I told him to do. He took some men to fight against
to the top of the hill so that they/we could see the whole battle area.
11 Whenever Moses/I lifted up his/my arms, the Israeli men started to win the battle.
And whenever he/I lowered his/my arms, the Amalek people-group started to win.
12 But his/my arms became tired. So Aaron and Hur rolled a large stone for Moses/
me to sit on. While he/I was sitting on it, those two held up his/my arms, one on one
side and the other on the other side. In that way, they kept his/my arms lifted up, and
his/my arms held steady until the sun went down.
13 So Joshua and the men with him completely defeated the Amalek people-group,
using their swords to fight against them.
14 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Write an account of this battle, and then read
it to Joshua. Also write that some day I will completely get rid of the Amalek peoplegroup.”
15 Then Moses/I built a stone altar there and named it ‘Yahweh is like my flag’.
16 He/I said, “Hold high Yahweh’s flag! Yahweh will continue to fight against the
Amalek people-group ◄forever/in all future generations►!”
18
Moses’ father-in-law, Jethro, came to visit him
EXODUS 18:1
112
EXODUS 18:18
1 Jethro, who was the priest for the Midian people-group, and who was also Moses’/
my father-in-law, heard about all that God had done for the Israeli people. He heard
about how Yahweh had brought them out of Egypt.
2 Moses/ I had previously sent his/ my wife Zipporah back home when he/ I was
returning to Egypt. But now Jethro came to him/me,
3 bringing Zipporah and their/our two sons. One son was named Gershom, which
sounds like the Hebrew word that means ‘foreigner’, because he/I had said, “I have
been a foreigner living in another land.”
4 Her other son was named Eliezer, which sounds like the Hebrew words that mean
‘God helps me’, because he/I had said “God, whom my father worshiped, has helped
me and saved me from being killed [MTY] by the king of Egypt.”
5 While Moses/I was camped with the Israeli people in the desert near Sinai, God’s
sacred/holy mountain, Jethro came to him/me, bringing along Moses’/my wife and
our two sons.
6 Jethro had sent a message to Moses/me, “I, your father-in-law, Jethro, am coming
to see you, bringing along your wife and your two sons!”
7 So Moses/I went out of the campsite to meet his/my father-in-law. He/I bowed
before him, and kissed him on the cheek. ◄They both/We► asked each other, “Have
you been healthy?” Then they/we went into Moses’/my tent.
8 Moses/I told Jethro everything that Yahweh had done to the king and all the other
people in Egypt for the sake of the Israeli people. He/I also told him about the troubles/
problems they/we had experienced on the way, and how Yahweh had helped them/
us.
9 Jethro rejoiced when he heard all that Yahweh had done for the Israeli people.
10 He said, “Praise Yahweh, who has rescued you from the powerful [MTY] Egyptian
11 Now I realize that Yahweh is greater than all other gods, because he rescued
suffer.”
offering, and he also offered other sacrifices to God. Aaron and the Israeli elders/
Jethro gave Moses some good advice about appointing judges
the people. The people were continually bringing their disputes to Moses/me, from
morning until evening.
14 When Jethro saw everything that Moses/I was doing for the people, he said,
“◄Why are you doing all this for the people?/You should not be doing all this for the
people!► [RHQ] Why are you doing this by yourself, and all the people are crowding
around you, from morning until evening, asking you to make decisions for them
[RHQ]?”
15 Moses/I replied, “I am doing this because the people keep coming to me to find
out what God desires.
16 When they have a dispute about something, they come to me, and they ask me
to decide which of them is right. I also tell them all of God’s laws and instructions.”
17 Jethro said to him/me, “What you are doing is not good for you or for the people.
18 You and these people will ◄wear yourselves out/become exhausted►! This work
is too much for one person. You are not able to do it by yourself.
EXODUS 18:19
113
EXODUS 19:9
19 Now listen to some good advice [MTY] I will give to you. If you do what I suggest,
God will help you. You should continue to speak to God and tell him about the people’s
disputes.
20 You should also teach the people what God has commanded and instructed you.
You should also explain to them how they should conduct their lives, and the things
that they should do.
21 But in addition, you should choose some other men to help you. Choose men
who have reverence for God and who will not accept bribes. Appoint some of them
to make decisions for groups of ten people, some for groups of 50 people, some for
groups of 100 people, and some for groups of 1,000 people.
22 Allow them to serve permanently to settle disputes for the people. The difficult
matters the people can bring to you; but the matters that are not difficult, they can
decide themselves. That will make the work easier for you, as they help you do that
work.
23 If you do that, and I think that God is telling you to do it (OR, if God tells you
to do it), you will not become exhausted, and all the people will be able to go home
feeling satisfied about the decisions, with their disputes settled quickly”.
24 Moses/I accepted what his/my father-in-law Jethro suggested.
25 Moses/I chose capable men from among the Israeli people.
26 They were appointed permanently to make decisions about the people’s disputes.
They brought the difficult cases to Moses/me, but they decided the matters that were
not difficult by themselves.
27 Then Moses/I said goodbye to his/my father-in-law, and Jethro returned home.
19
Yahweh gave instructions to Moses at Sinai Mountain.
1-2 The Israeli people then left Rephidim, and exactly two months after leaving
Egypt, they/we came to the desert near Sinai Mountain. They/We set up their/our
tents at the base of the mountain.
3 Moses/I climbed up the mountain to talk with God. Yahweh called to him/me from
the top of the mountain and said, “This is what I want you to say to the Israeli people,
the descendants of Jacob:
4 ‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians. You have seen what I did for all of
you and how I brought you here to me. It was as though I lifted you up as an eagle
carries its young eaglets on its wings [MET].
5 So now, if you will do what I tell you and obey all that I command you, you will be
my own people. All the people-groups on the earth are mine, but you will be ◄dearer/
more special► to me than all the other people-groups.
6 You will be people over whom I will rule, and you will all ◄be like priests/represent
me to other nations as priests represent me to one nation► [MET], and you will be
completely dedicated to me.’ That is what you must tell the Israeli people.”
7 So Moses/I went down the mountain and summoned the elders/leaders of the
people. He/I told them everything that Yahweh had told him/me to tell them.
8 The people all said, “We will do everything that Yahweh has told us to do.” Then
Moses/I climbed back up the mountain and reported to Yahweh what the people had
said.
9 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Listen carefully: I am going to appear to you
from inside a thick cloud. When I am speaking to you, the people will hear it, and
they will always trust in you.” Then Moses/I went down the mountain and reported to
EXODUS 19:10
114
EXODUS 20:4
the people what Yahweh said. Then he/I went back up the mountain and told Yahweh
what the people replied.
10 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Go back down to the people again. Tell them to
purify themselves today and tomorrow. Tell them to wash their clothes, too.
down to Sinai Mountain to where all the people can see me.
sure that you do not climb the mountain or even go near it. Anyone who even touches
the base of the mountain must be executed.’
13 Do not let anyone touch any person or any animal that touches the mountain.
You must kill any person or animal that touches the mountain by throwing stones at it
or shooting it with arrows. But when you hear a long loud trumpet sound, the people
can come close to the base of the mountain.”
14 So Moses/ I went down the mountain again and told the people to purify
themselves. They did what Moses/I told them to do, and they also washed their
clothes.
15 Then Moses/I said to the people, “Be ready on the day after tomorrow. And you
men must not have sex with [EUP] your wives until after then.”
16 Two days later, during the morning, there was thunder and lightning, and a very
dark cloud on the mountain. A trumpet sounded very loudly, with the result that the
people in the camp shook/trembled because they were very afraid.
17 Then Moses/I led the people outside the camp to meet with God. They stood at
the base of the mountain.
18 All of Sinai Mountain was covered in smoke, because Yahweh had descended on
it, surrounded by a fire. The smoke rose up like the smoke from the chimney of a
furnace, and the whole mountain shook violently.
19 As the sound of the trumpet continued to become louder, Moses/I spoke to Yahweh,
and Yahweh answered him/me in a loud voice that sounded like thunder.
20 Then Yahweh came down again onto the top of Sinai Mountain, and he
summoned Moses/me to come up to the top of the mountain. So Moses/I went up.
21 Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Go down again and warn the people not to cross the
boundary in order to look at me. If they do that, many of them will die.
22 Also, the priests who habitually come near me must purify themselves. If they
do not do that, I will punish them.”
23 Then Moses/I said to Yahweh, “The people will not climb the mountain, because
you commanded them, saying, ‘Set a boundary around the mountain, to make it
sacred/taboo.’ ”
24 Yahweh replied, “Go down the mountain, and bring Aaron back up with you. But
do not allow the priests or other people to cross the boundary to come up to me. If
they cross it, I will punish them.”
25 So Moses/I went down the mountain again and told the people what Yahweh had
said.
20
God gave the people the Ten Commandments
1 Then God said this to the Israeli people:
2 “I am Yahweh God, the one you worship.
I am the one who brought you out of
Egypt. I am the one who freed you from being slaves there.
3 So you must worship only me; you must not worship any other god.
4 You must not carve/make for yourselves any idol that represents anything in the
sky or that is on the ground or that is in the water under the ground/earth.
EXODUS 20:5
115
EXODUS 20:25
5 You must not bow down to any idol and worship it, because I am Yahweh God,
and I ◄am very jealous/want you to worship me only►. I will punish those who
sin and hate me. I will punish not only them, but I will punish ◄their descendants,
down to the third and fourth generation/their children and grandchildren and greatgrandchildren►.
6 But I will steadfastly love thousands of generations of those who love me and obey
my commandments (OR, I will love for thousands of generations.)
7 Do not use my name carelessly (OR, for wrong/ evil purposes), because I am
Yahweh God, the one whom you should worship, and I will certainly punish those
who use my name for wrong/evil purposes [LIT].
8 Do not forget that the seventh day of every week is mine, so dedicate those days
to me.
9 There are six days each week for you to do all your work,
10 but the seventh day is a day of rest, a day dedicated to me, Yahweh God, the one
whom you should worship. On that day you must not do any work. You and your
sons and daughters and your male and female slaves must not work. You must not
even force your livestock to work, and you must not allow foreigners to work, those
who are living in your country.
11 I, Yahweh, created the sky, the earth, the ocean, and everything that is in them, in
six days. Then I stopped my work of creating everything, and rested on the seventh
day. That is the reason that I, Yahweh, have blessed the rest day and set it apart to
be a sacred/special day.
12 Honor/Respect your fathers and your mothers, in order that you may live a long
time in the land that I, Yahweh God, will give you.
13 Do not murder anyone.
14 Do not ◄commit adultery/have sex with anyone other than your spouse►.
15 Do not steal anything.
16 Do not falsely accuse anyone of committing a crime.
17 Do not ◄covet/ desire to have► someone else’s house, someone else’s wife,
someone else’s male or female slave, someone else’s livestock, someone else’s
donkeys, or anything else that some other person owns.”
18 When the people heard the thunder and saw the lightning, and when they heard
the sound of the trumpet and saw the smoke on the mountain, they were afraid and
trembled. They stood at a distance,
19 and said to Moses/me, “If you speak to us, we will listen. But do not let God speak
any more to us. We are afraid that if he speaks any more to us, we will die.”
20 Moses/I replied, “Do not be afraid! God has come to determine/test how you will
behave. He wants you to revere him, and to not sin.”
21 Then, as the people watched from a distance, Moses/I went close to the black
cloud where God was.
22-23 Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Say this to the Israeli people: ‘You have heard how
I, Yahweh, have spoken to you from heaven. I told you that you must not make any
idols of silver or gold that you will worship instead of me.
24 Make for me an altar from dirt. Sacrifice on it the animals that you will burn
completely. Also sacrifice on it the animals that you will not burn completely, to
maintain fellowship with me. Worship me [MTY] in any place that I choose for you
to honor/worship me; and if you do that, I will come to you and bless you.
25 If you make for me an altar from stones, do not make it from stones that you have
cut to make them look nice, because you will make the altar unsuitable for worshiping
me if you use tools to cut the stones.
EXODUS 21:18
26 Do not make an altar that has steps in front of it, because if you do that, people
could see your naked buttocks as you go up the steps.’ ”
21
Instructions for treating slaves
1 “Here are some other instructions to give to the Israeli people:
2 When/If you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve you for only six years.
In the
seventh year you must free him from being your slave, and he is not required to pay
you anything for setting him free.
3 If he was not married before he became your slave, and if he marries someone
while he is your slave, his wife is not to be set free with him. But if he was married
before he became your slave, you must free both him and his wife.
4 If a slave’s master gives him a wife, and she gives birth to sons or daughters while
her husband is a slave, only the man is to be freed. His wife and children will continue
to be slaves of their master.
5 But when it is time for the slave to be set free, if the slave says, ‘I love my master
and my wife and my children, and I do not want to be set free,’
6 then his master must take him to the place where they worship God (OR, to the
owner’s house). There he must make the slave stand against the door or the doorpost.
Then the master will use an ◄awl/pointed metal rod► to make a hole in the slave’s
ear. Then he will fasten a tag to the slave’s ear to indicate that ◄he will own that slave
for the rest of his life/he will own the slave as long as the slave lives►.
7 If a man sells his daughter to become a slave, she should not be set free after six
years, as the male slaves are.
8 If the man who bought her wanted her to be his wife, but if later he is not pleased
with her, he must sell her back to her father. He must not sell her to a foreigner,
because that would be breaking the contract/agreement he made with the girl’s father.
9 If the man who buys her wants her to be a wife for his son, he must then treat
her as though she were his own daughter.
10 If the master takes another slave girl to be another wife for himself, he must
continue to give the first slave wife the same amount of food and clothing that he
gave to her before, and he must continue to have sex [EUP] with her as before.
11 If he does not do all these three things for her, he must free her from being a
slave, and she is not required to pay anything for being set free.
12 You must execute anyone who strikes another person with the result that the
person who is struck dies.
13 But if the one who struck the other did not intend to kill that person, the one
who struck him can escape to a place that I will choose for you, and he will be safe
there.
14 But if someone gets angry with another person and kills him, even if the murderer
runs to the altar, a place that God designated as a place to be safe, you must execute
him.
15 Anyone who strikes his father or mother must surely be executed.
keep him as a slave, must be executed.
18 Suppose two people fight, and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist.
for a while,
EXODUS 21:19
117
19 and later he is able to walk outside using a cane.
EXODUS 21:36
Then the person who struck
him does not have to be punished. However, he must pay the injured person the
money he could not earn while he was recovering, and he must also pay the injured
person’s medical expenses until that person is well.
20 If someone strikes his male or female slave with a stick, if the slave dies
◄immediately/as a result► [IDM], the one who struck him must be punished.
21 But if the slave lives for a day or two after he is struck and then dies, you must
not punish the one who struck him. Not having that slave to be able to work for him
any longer is enough punishment.
22 Suppose two people are fighting and they hurt a pregnant woman with the result
that ◄she has a miscarriage/her baby is born prematurely and dies►. If the woman
is not harmed in any other way, the one who injured her must pay a fine. He must
pay whatever the woman’s husband demands, after a judge approves of the fine.
23 But if the woman is injured in some additional way, the one who injured her
must be caused to suffer in exactly the same way that he caused her to suffer. If she
dies, he must be executed.
24-25 If her eye is injured or destroyed, or if he knocks out one of her teeth, or her
hand or foot is injured, or if she is burned or bruised, the one who injured her must
be injured in the same way.
26 If the owner of a slave strikes the eye of his male or female slave and ruins it, he
must free that slave because of what he did to the slave’s eye.
27 If someone knocks out one of his slave’s teeth, he must free the slave because of
what he did to the slave’s tooth.
28 If a bull gores a man or woman with the result that the person dies, you must
kill the bull by throwing stones at it, but you must not punish the owner of the bull.
29 But suppose the bull had attacked people several times before, and its owner had
been warned, but he did not keep the bull inside a fence. Then you must kill the bull
by throwing stones at it, but you must also execute its owner.
30 However, if the owner of the bull is allowed to pay a fine ◄to save his own life/in
order not to be executed►, he must pay the full amount that the judges say that he
must pay.
31 If someone’s bull attacks and gores another person’s son or daughter, you must
treat the bull’s owner according to that same rule.
32 If a bull attacks and gores a male or female slave, its owner must pay to the
slave’s owner 30 pieces of silver. Then you must kill the bull by throwing stones at it.
33 Suppose someone has a pit/cistern and does not keep it covered, and someone’s
bull or donkey falls into it and dies.
34 Then the owner of the pit/cistern must pay for the animal that died. He must
give the money to the animal’s owner, but then he can take away the animal that
died and do whatever he wants to with it.
35 If someone’s bull hurts another person’s bull with the result that it dies, the
owners of both bulls must sell the bull that is living, and they must divide between
of the animal that died.
and its owner did not keep it inside a fence, then the owner of that bull must give
that died and do with it whatever he wants to do.”
Laws regarding possessions
22
EXODUS 22:1
118
EXODUS 22:15
1 Yahweh also said, “If someone steals a bull or a sheep, and then slaughters it to
sell it or to sacrifice it or sells its meat to someone else, he must pay five bulls for the
bull that he stole, and he must pay four sheep for the sheep that he stole.
2 If a thief is caught while he is breaking into someone else’s house at night, if the
one who catches him kills the thief, he is not guilty of murdering him.
3 But if that happens during the daytime, the one who killed the thief is guilty of
murdering him. The thief must pay for what he stole. If he has no animals with
which to pay for the one that he stole, he must be sold to become someone’s else’s
4 If the thief still has the animal when he is caught, whether it is a bull or a donkey
or a sheep, and it is still alive, the thief must give back the stolen animal as well as
giving two additional animals for each one that he stole.
5 If someone allows his animals to ◄graze/eat the grass► in his field or in his
vineyard, and if they stray away and eat the crops in another person’s field, the
owner of the animals must pay the owner of those crops by giving him the best crops
from his own field or vineyard.
6 Suppose someone starts a fire in his own field, and the fire spreads through the
grass and starts burning in someone else’s field, and the fire burns grain that is
growing or grain that is already cut and stacked. Then the person who started the
fire must pay completely for the damage.
7 Suppose someone gives to another person some money or other valuable goods
and asks him to guard them in his house for a while. If those things are stolen from
that person’s house, if the thief is caught, he must pay back twice as much as he stole.
8 But if the thief is not caught, the owner of the house from which the things were
stolen must stand before the judges, so that the judges can determine whether the
owner of the house was the one who took the other man’s goods and sold them to
someone else.
9 If two people argue about which one of them owns a bull or a donkey or a sheep
or some clothing, or something else that has been lost, the two people who each claim/
say that the item belongs to them must stand before the judges. The one whom the
judges declare is lying must pay back to the real owner twice as many bulls or donkeys
or sheep or pieces of clothing.
10 Suppose someone gives his donkey or bull or sheep or some other animal to
someone else and asks him to take care of it for a while, and the animal dies or is
injured or is stolen while no one is watching.
11 Then the person who was taking care of the animal must ◄swear/ solemnly
declare►, knowing that God is listening, that he did not steal the animal. If he did not

man who promised to take care of it must pay back the owner for the animal.
remains of the animal that was killed and show it to the animal’s owner. If he does
that, he will not have to pay anything for the animal.
14 If someone borrows an animal, and if that animal is hurt or dies when its owner
is not there, the one who borrowed it must pay the owner for the animal.
15 But if that happens when the owner of the animal is there, the one who borrowed
it will not have to pay back anything. If the man who borrowed it only rented it, the
money that he paid to rent it will be enough to pay for the animal dying or being
injured.”
EXODUS 22:16
119
EXODUS 23:4
Laws concerning everyday life
16 “If a man persuades a girl/woman to have sex with him, a girl/woman who ◄is
a virgin/has never had sex with any man► and who is not engaged to be married, he
must pay the bride price for her and marry her.
17 But if her father refuses to allow her to marry him, he must pay to the woman’s
father the amount of money that is equal to the amount of bride price money that
men pay for virgins.
18 You must execute any woman who ◄practices sorcery/is a shaman►.
19 You must execute any person who has sex with an animal.
20 You must offer sacrifices only to Yahweh. You must execute anyone who offers a
sacrifice to any other god.
21 You must not mistreat a foreigner who comes to live among you. Do not forget
that you were previously foreigners in Egypt.
22 You must not mistreat any widow or any orphan.
23 If you mistreat them and they cry out to me for help, I will hear them.
24 And I will be angry with you, and I will cause you to be killed in a war [MTY].
25 If you lend money to any of my people who are poor, do not act like a
moneylender and require him to pay interest on the money.
26 If he gives you his cloak to guarantee that he will pay the money back, you must
give the cloak back to him before the sun goes down,
27 because he needs it to keep him warm during the night. ◄That is the only covering
that poor people have when they sleep at night./What else will he cover himself with
during the night?► [RHQ] If you do not act mercifully toward him by returning his
cloak, when he cries out to me asking for my help, I will help him, because I always
act mercifully.
28 Do not ◄revile/speak evil about► me, and do not ◄curse/ask me to do harmful
things to► any ruler of your people.
29 ◄Do not withhold from/Give► me the best parts of the grain that you harvest and
of the olive oil and the wine that you produce.
30 You must dedicate your firstborn sons to me. Similarly, your firstborn male cattle
and sheep belong to me. After those animals are born, allow them to stay with their
mothers for seven days. On the eighth day, offer them to me as a sacrifice.
31 You are people who are ◄completely dedicated to/set apart for► me. And I detest
the meat of any animal that has been killed by wild animals. Therefore you should
not eat such meat. Instead, throw it where the dogs can eat it.”
23
2 Do not join a group of people who are planning to do something evil. Do not
testify the way the crowd wants you to, if that will prevent the judge from deciding the
case justly/fairly.
3 When a poor person is on trial, do not testify in his favor just because he is poor
and you feel sorry for him.
4 If you see someone’s bull or donkey when it is wandering away loose, take it back
to its owner, even if the owner is your enemy.
EXODUS 23:5
120
EXODUS 23:22
5 If you see someone’s donkey that has fallen down because of its heavy load, help
the owner to get the donkey up again, even if he is someone who hates you. Do not
just walk away without helping him.
6 Decide the cases of poor people who are on trial as fairly as you decide the cases
of other people.
7 Do not accuse people falsely. Do not decide that innocent and righteous [DOU]
people should be executed, because I will ◄punish/not forgive► people who do such
an evil thing.
8 Do not accept money that is a bribe, because officials who accept bribes are not
able to [MTY] decide what is right to do, and they do not allow innocent people to be
treated fairly.
9 Do not mistreat foreigners who live among you. You know how people often treat
foreigners, because the Egyptians did not treat you well when you were foreigners
there.
10 Plant seeds in your ground and gather the harvest for six years.
11 But during the seventh year you must not plant anything. If things grow without
your planting seeds, allow poor people to harvest and eat the crops. If there are still
crops ◄left over/that they do not harvest►, allow wild animals to eat them. Do the
same thing with your grapevines/vineyards and your olive trees.
12 You may work for six days each week, but on the seventh day you must rest and
not work. And on the seventh day you must allow your work animals and your slaves
and the foreigners who live among you also to rest and be refreshed.
13 Make certain that you obey everything that I have commanded you to do. Do not
pray to [MTY] other gods. Do not even mention their names.”
Rules about three annual festivals
14 “Every year you must celebrate three festivals to honor me.
15 The first one is the Festival of Bread That Has No Yeast. Celebrate it in the month
that is named Abib. That is the month in which you left Egypt. Celebrate it in the
way that I commanded you. And always bring [LIT] an offering when you come to
worship me.
16 The second one is the Festival of Harvesting. During that festival you must offer
to me the first parts/harvest of your crops that grow from the seeds that you planted.
The third one is the Festival of Living in Temporary Shelters. That will be after you
finish harvesting your grain and grapes and fruit.
17 Every year, at each of these times, all the men must gather together to worship
me, Yahweh God.
18 When you sacrifice an animal and offer it to me, you must not offer bread that
has been baked with yeast. When you offer sacrifices, burn the fat from the animals
on that same day. Do not allow any fat to remain until the next morning.
19 Each year, when you harvest your crops, bring to the place where you worship
me, Yahweh God, the first part of what you harvest. When you kill a ◄young animal/
kid or lamb or calf►, do not prepare to eat it by boiling it in its mother’s milk.”
Yahweh gave the Israeli people several promises
I am going to send an angel ahead of you, to guard you as you
travel and to bring you safely to the place that I have prepared for you. Pay attention
to what he says and obey him. Do not rebel against him, because he will have my
authority [MTY] and he will ◄punish/not forgive► [LIT] you if you rebel against him.
22 But if you pay attention to what he says and if you do all that I tell you to do, I
will fight strongly [DOU] against all of your enemies.
20-21 “Note this:
EXODUS 23:23
121
EXODUS 24:5
23 My angel will go ahead of you, and will take you to where the Amor and Heth
and Periz and Canaan and Hiv and Jebus people-groups live, and I will completely
get rid of them.

born prematurely►, and no women will be unable to become pregnant. And I will
enable you to live a long time.
27 I will cause the people who oppose you to become very afraid of me. I will cause
the people whom you fight against to become very confused. And then I will cause
them to turn around and run away from you.
28 I will cause your enemies to become terrified. And I will expel the Hiv, Canaan,
and Heth people-groups from your land.
29 I will not expel all of them in less than one year. If I did that, your land would
become deserted, and there would be very many wild animals ◄that would attack
you/you would not be able to control►.
30 I will expel those people-groups slowly, a few at a time, until the number of your
people increases and you are able to live everywhere in the land.
31 I will cause the borders of your land to extend from the ◄Red Sea/Gulf of Aqaba►
in the southeast to the Mediterranean Sea in the northwest, and from the Sinai Desert
in the southwest to the Euphrates River in the northeast of the country. I will enable
you [MTY] to expel the people who live there, so that you will expel them as you
occupy more of the country.
32 You must not make any agreement/treaty with those people or with their gods.
33 Do not allow those people to live in your land, in order that they do not cause
you to sin against me. If you worship their gods, you will not be able to escape from
worshiping them and sinning against me, just like someone caught in a trap is unable
to escape [MET].”
24
Yahweh’s agreement is confirmed
1 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Come to me, up on top of this mountain, you and
Aaron and his sons Nadab and Abihu. Also take along 70 of the Israeli elders/leaders.
While you are still some distance from the top of the mountain, prostrate yourselves
on the ground and worship me.
2 Moses, I will allow you alone to come near to me. The others must not come near,
and the rest of the people must not come up the mountain.”
3 Moses/I went and told the people everything that Yahweh had said and all that he
had commanded. The people all replied together, saying, “We will do everything that
Yahweh has told us to do.”
4 Then Moses/I wrote down everything that Yahweh had commanded. Early the
next morning Moses/I built a stone altar. He/I also set up twelve stones, one for each
of the Israeli tribes.
5 He/I also selected some young men. They burned sacrifices to Yahweh and they
also sacrificed some cattle that they did not burn completely, for the purpose of
maintaining fellowship with Yahweh.
EXODUS 24:6
122
EXODUS 25:7
7 Then he/I took the scroll on which he/I had written everything that Yahweh had
people were listening. Then all the people said, “We will do all that Yahweh has told
us to do. We will obey everything.”
8 Then Moses/I took the blood that was in the bowls and threw/splashed it on the
people. He/I said, “This is the blood that ◄confirms/puts into effect► the agreement
that Yahweh made with you when he gave you all these commands.”
9 Then Moses/I, along with Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the 70 Israeli elders/leaders,
went up the mountain,
10 and they/we saw God, the one whom the Israeli people worship. Under his feet
was something like a pavement made of expensive blue stones called sapphires. They
were as clear as the sky is when there are no clouds.
11 God did not harm [MTY] those Israeli elders/leaders because of their having seen
him. They saw God, and they ate and drank together! Then we all went back down
the mountain.
12 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Come up to me again on top of this mountain.
While you are here, I will give you two stone slabs on which I have written all the
laws [DOU] that I have given to you to instruct/teach the people.”
13-14 So Moses/I told the elders, “Stay here with the other people until we return! Do
not forget that Aaron and Hur will be with you. So if anyone has a dispute while I am
gone, he can go to those two men.” Then Moses/I went with his/my servant Joshua
part of the way up the mountain that was dedicated to God.
15 Then Moses/I went the rest of the way up the mountain. A cloud covered the
mountain.
16 The ◄glory/brilliant light► of Yahweh came down on the mountain and covered
it for six days. On the seventh day, Yahweh called to Moses/me from the middle of
the cloud.
17 When the Israeli people looked at the top of the mountain, the glory of Yahweh
was like a big fire that was burning there.
18 Moses/I went into the cloud on top of the mountain. He/I was there for 40 days
and nights.
25
Yahweh gave Moses instructions about a big Sacred Tent for their worship
1 Yahweh said to Moses/me, “There are many things that I want you to tell to the
Israeli people.
2 Tell them that they must give offerings/gifts to me. Receive from the people every
offering/gift that they want to give to me.
3 These are the things that they may offer/give: Gold, silver, bronze,
4 blue, purple, and scarlet yarn/wool, fine ◄linen/white cloth►, goats’ hair for
making cloth,
5 rams’ skins that have been ◄tanned/dyed red►, goatskins, hard wood from acacia
trees,
6 olive oil to burn in the lamps, spices to put in the olive oil for anointing the priests
and in the sweet-smelling incense,
7 expensive quartz stones called onyx, and other expensive stones to be fastened to
the priest’s vest and put on the pouches that are to be fastened to the vest.
EXODUS 25:8
8 Tell the people to make a big Sacred Tent for me, so that I can live in it among
them.
9 They must make the Sacred Tent and all the things that will be used inside it
according to the plan/model that I will show you.”
Instructions for making the sacred chest
10 “Tell the people to make a sacred chest from acacia wood. It is to be ◄45 in./110
cm.► long, ◄27 in./66 cm.► wide, and ◄27 in./66 cm.► high.
11 Cover it with pure gold inside and outside, and put a gold border around the top
of it.
12 They must make/cast four rings from gold and fasten them to the legs of the chest.
Put two rings on each side of the chest.
13 They must make two poles from acacia wood, and they must cover them with
gold.
14 They must put the poles into the rings on the sides of the chest, so that the chest
can be carried by the poles.
15 The poles must always be left in the rings; they must not take the poles out of the
rings.
16 Put inside the chest the two stone slabs that I will give you, on which I have written
my commandments.
17 Tell them to make a lid for the chest from pure gold. It will be the place where I
will forgive people’s sins. It also is to be ◄45 in./110 cm.► long and ◄27 in./66 cm.►
wide.
18 Tell them to hammer huge lump of gold into the form of two creatures that have

Instructions for the priests’ clothing
Ithamar. ◄Set them apart/They are the ones whom I have chosen► from the rest of the
Israeli people, in order that they can serve me by being priests.
2 Tell the people to make beautiful clothes for Aaron, clothes that are suitable for
one who has this dignified and sacred work.
3 Talk to all the skilled workmen, those to whom I have given special ability. Tell
them to make clothes for Aaron, for him to wear when he is ◄set apart/dedicated►
to become a priest to serve me.
4 These are the clothes that they are to make: A sacred pouch for Aaron to wear
over his chest, a sacred apron, a robe, an embroidered tunic/gown, a ◄turban/cloth
to wrap around his head►, and a sash/waistband. These are the clothes that your
older brother Aaron and his sons must wear as they serve me by doing the work that
priests do.
5 The skilled workmen must use fine linen and blue, purple, and red yarn/thread
to make these clothes.”
Instructions for the sacred apron
6 “The skilled workmen must make the sacred apron from fine linen, and skillfully
embroider it with blue, purple, and red yarn/thread.
7 It must have two shoulder straps, to join the front part to the back part.
8 A carefully-woven sash, which must be made from the same materials as the
sacred apron, must be sewn onto the sacred apron.
9 A skilled workman must take two expensive onyx stones and engrave on them the
names of the twelve sons of Jacob.
10 He must engrave the names in the order in which Jacob’s sons were born. He
must engrave six names on one stone, and the other six names on the other stone.
11 A gem-cutter should engrave these names on the stones. Then he should enclose
the stones in ◄settings/tiny gold frames►.
12 Then he should fasten the stones onto the shoulder straps of the sacred apron,
to represent the twelve Israeli tribes. In that way, Aaron will carry the names of the
EXODUS 28:13
128
EXODUS 28:32
tribes on his shoulders in order that I, Yahweh, will never forget my people (OR, in
order that he will always remember that those tribes belong to Yahweh).
13 The settings for the stones must be made from gold.
14 Tell them to make two tiny chains that are braided like cords, and fasten the
chains to the settings.”
Instructions for the sacred pouch
15 “Tell the skilled workman to make a sacred pouch for Aaron to wear over his
chest. He will use the things he puts into the pouch to determine my answers to the
questions he asks. It must be made of the same materials as the sacred apron, and
embroidered in the same way.
16 It is to be square, and the material must be folded double, so that it is ◄9 in./22

19 In the third row he must put a red jacinth, a white agate, and a purple amethyst.
20 In the fourth row he must put a yellow beryl, a red carnelian, and a green jasper.
21 A gem-cutter should engrave on each of these twelve stones the name of one of
the sons of Jacob. These names will represent the twelve Israeli tribes.
22 The two chains that are made from pure gold and braided like cords are for
attaching the sacred pouch to the sacred apron.
23 The workman must make two gold rings, and attach them to the upper corners
of the sacred pouch.
24 He must make two gold cords, and fasten one end of each cord to one of the rings.
25 He must fasten the other end of each cord to the two settings that enclose the
stones. In that way, the sacred pouch will be attached to the shoulder straps of the
sacred apron.
26 Then he must make two more gold rings, and attach them to the lower corners
of the sacred pouch, on the inside edges, next to the sacred apron.
27 He must make two more gold rings, and attach them to the lower part of the
front of the shoulder straps, near to where the shoulder straps are joined to the sacred
apron, just above the carefully-woven sash/waistband.
28 The skilled workman must tie the rings on the sacred pouch to the rings on the
sacred apron with a blue cord, so that the sacred pouch is above the sash/waistband
and does not come loose from the sacred apron.
29 In that way, Aaron will have the names of the twelve Israeli tribes in the sacred
pouch close to his chest when he enters the Holy Place. This will remind him that I,
Yahweh, will never forget my people (OR, that he represents my people when he talks
to me, Yahweh).
30 Put into the sacred pouch the two things that the priest will use to determine my
answers to the questions he asks. In that way, they will be close to his chest when he
enters the Holy Place to talk to me. He will use them to find out what is my will for
the Israeli people.”
Instructions for other clothes for the priests
31 “Tell the workmen to use only blue cloth to make the robe that is to be worn
underneath the priest’s sacred apron.

show that he accepts the guilt if the Israeli people offer their sacrifices to me in a way
that is not correct, and I, Yahweh, will accept their sacrifices.
39 “Tell them to weave the long-sleeved tunic/gown from fine linen. Also, they must
make from fine linen a turban and a sash/waistband, and embroider designs on it.
40 “Tell them to make beautiful long-sleeved tunics/gowns, sashes, and caps for
Aaron’s sons. Make ones that will be suitable for those who have this dignified work.
41 Put these clothes on your older brother Aaron and on his sons. Then ◄set them
apart/dedicate them► for this work by anointing them with olive oil, in order that
they may serve me by being priests.
42 Also tell them to make linen undershorts for them. The undershorts should
extend from their waists to their thighs, in order that no one can see their private
parts.
43 Aaron and his sons must always wear those undershorts when they enter the
Sacred Tent or when they come near to the altar to offer sacrifices in the Holy Place.
If they do not obey this command, I will cause them to die. Aaron and all his male
descendants must obey this rule forever.”

1 “This is what you must do to dedicate Aaron and his sons to serve me by being
priests: Select one young bull and two rams that do not have any defects.
2 Bake three kinds of bread using finely-ground wheat flour, but without yeast: Bake
some loaves that do not have any olive oil in them, bake some loaves that have olive
oil in the dough, and bake some thin wafers that will be smeared with olive oil after
they are baked.
3 Put them in a basket and offer them to me when you sacrifice the young bull and
the two rams.
4 Take Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Sacred Tent, and wash them ritually.
5 Then put the special clothes on Aaron—the long-sleeved tunic/gown, the robe that
will be worn underneath the sacred apron, the sacred apron, the sacred pouch, and
the sash/waistband.
6 Place the turban on his head, and fasten to the turban the ornament that has the
words ‘Dedicated to Yahweh’ engraved on it.
7 Then take the oil and pour some on his head to ◄dedicate him/set him apart►.
8 Then bring his sons and put the long-sleeved tunics/gowns on them.
9 Put the sashes/waistbands around their waists and the caps on their heads. That
is the ritual by which you are to ◄dedicate them/set them apart► to be priests. Aaron
and his male descendants must serve me by being priests forever.
10 “Then bring the young bull to the entrance of the Sacred Tent. Tell Aaron and
his sons to put their hands on the head of the young bull.
EXODUS 29:11

13 Take all the fat that covers the inner organs of the young bull, the best part of
the liver, and the two kidneys with the fat on them, and burn all these on the altar
as an offering to me.
14 But the meat of the young bull and its hide and intestines must be burned outside
the camp. That will be an offering to forgive the guilt of your sins.
15 “Then select one of the rams, and tell Aaron and his sons to put their hands on
the head of the ram.
16 Then kill the ram by slitting its throat. Catch/Drain some of the blood and splash
it against all four sides of the altar.
17 Then cut the ram into pieces. Wash its inner organs and its rear legs and put
those with the head
18 and burn those pieces completely on the altar with the rest of the ram. That will
be an offering to me, Yahweh, and the smell will please me.
19 “Take the other ram that was selected for these rituals, and tell Aaron and his
sons to put their hands on the ram’s head.
20 Then kill the ram by slitting its throat, and drain the blood into a bowl. Smear
some of the blood on the lobe of the right ears of Aaron and his sons, and on the
thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Throw/Splash the
rest of the blood against the four sides of the altar.
21 Wipe up some of the blood that is on the altar, mix it with some of the oil for
anointing, and sprinkle it on Aaron and his clothes, and on his sons and their clothes.
By doing that, you will dedicate them and their clothes to me.
22 “Also, cut off the ram’s fat and its fat tail and the fat that covers the inner organs,
the best part of the liver, the two kidneys with the fat on them, and the right thigh.
23 Take also one of each of the kinds of bread that was baked—one made with no
oil, one with oil, and one thin wafer.
24 Put all these things in the hands of Aaron and his sons. Then tell them to lift them
up high to dedicate them to me.
25 Then take them from their hands and burn them on the altar, on top of the other
things that were placed there. That also will be an offering to me, and its smell will
please me.
26 Then take the meat of the ribs of the second ram that was killed, and lift it up
high as an offering to me. But then this part of the animal will be for you to eat.
27 Then take the meat of the ribs, the other thigh of the first ram that was sacrificed
to ◄dedicate/set apart► the priests, and the ram whose other parts were lifted high
to show that they were an offering to me; and set the meat of the ribs and thigh apart
for Aaron and his sons, for them to eat.
28 In the future, whenever the Israeli people present to me, Yahweh, offerings to
maintain fellowship with me, the ribs and the thigh of animals that they sacrifice will
be for Aaron and his male descendants to eat.
29 “After Aaron dies, the special clothes that he wore will belong to his sons. They
are to wear those clothes when they are ◄set apart/dedicated► to become priests.
30 Aaron’s son who becomes The Supreme Priest and enters the Sacred Tent and
performs rituals in the Holy Place must stay in the Sacred Tent, wearing these special
clothes, for seven days.
31 “Take the meat of the other ram that was sacrificed to ◄set apart/dedicate► Aaron
and his sons, and boil it in the courtyard.
EXODUS 29:32

33 They must eat the meat of the ram that was sacrificed to forgive them for their
permitted to eat this meat. Those who are not priests are not allowed to eat it, because
34 If any of this meat or some of the bread is not eaten that night, no one is permitted
to eat any of it the next day. It must be completely burned, because it is sacred/
dedicated to me.
35 “Those are the rituals that you(sg) must perform during those seven days when
you dedicate Aaron and his sons for this work. You must do everything that I have
commanded you.
36 Each of those seven days you must also sacrifice a young bull as an offering to
me, in order that I may forgive sins. Also, you must make another offering ◄to make
the altar pure in my sight/in order that I will consider the altar to be pure►. You
must also anoint the altar with olive oil, to ◄set it apart/dedicate it►.
37 Perform these rituals every day for seven days, to ◄set apart/dedicate► the altar
and make it pure. If you do not do that, anyone or anything that touches the altar
will become taboo.
38 “You must also sacrifice lambs and burn them on the altar. Each of those seven
days you must sacrifice two lambs.
39 One lamb must be sacrificed in the morning, and one must be sacrificed in the
evening.
40 With the first lamb, also offer ◄2 pounds/1 kilogram► of finely-ground wheat
flour mixed with one quart/liter of the best kind of olive oil, and one quart/liter of
wine as an offering.
41 In the evening, when you sacrifice the other lamb, offer the same amounts of
flour, olive oil, and wine as you did in the morning. This will be an offering to me,
Yahweh, that will be burned, and its smell will please me.
42 You and your descendants must continue making these offerings to me, Yahweh,
throughout all future generations. You must offer them at the entrance of the Sacred
Tent. That is where I will meet with you and speak to you.
43 That is where I will meet with the Israeli people, and the brilliant light of my
presence will cause that place to be holy/sacred.
44 I will dedicate the Sacred Tent and the altar. I will also dedicate Aaron and his
sons to serve me by being priests.
45 I will live among the Israeli people, and I will be their God.
46 They will know that I, Yahweh their God, am the one who brought them out of
Egypt in order that I might live among them.”

Instructions for the money to take care of the Sacred Tent
11 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,

Instructions for the work to be done by Bezalel and Oholiab
1-2 Yahweh also said to Moses/me, “Note that I have chosen Bezalel, the son of Uri

do very skilled work.
4 He can engrave skillful designs in gold, silver, and bronze.

He can carve things from wood and do other skilled work.

Dan, to work with him. I have also given special ability to other men, in order that
they can make all the things that I have commanded you to be made.

skilled workers must make all these things exactly as I have told you to do.”
Instructions for the day of rest
12 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
13 “Tell the Israeli people, ‘Obey my instructions regarding the ◄rest days/Sabbath

generations, that I, Yahweh, have ◄set you apart/chosen you► to be my people.

gave him/me the two stone slabs on which he had engraved his commandments with
his own fingers.
32
The Israelis made a golden calf to worship
1 ◄Moses/I► stayed on top of the mountain a long time.
When the people realized
that he/I was not returning quickly, they gathered near Aaron and said to him, “We
do not know what has happened to that man Moses who brought us here out of Egypt.
So quickly, make us ◄an idol/a statue of a god► who will lead us!”
2 Aaron replied to them, “All right, I will do that, but tell your wives and your sons
and your daughters to take off all their gold earrings and bring them to me.”
3 So the people did that. They took off all their gold earrings and brought them to
Aaron.
4 He took all those gold earrings and melted them in a fire. He poured the gold into
a mold and made a statue that looked like a young bull. The people saw it and said,
“This is the god of us Israeli people! This is the one who brought us up from the land
of Egypt!”
5 When Aaron saw what was happening, he built an altar in front of the statue of
the young bull. Then he announced, “Tomorrow we will have a festival to honor
Yahweh!”
6 So the people got up early the next morning and brought animals to kill and burn
as sacrifices on the altar. They also brought sacrifices to maintain fellowship with
Yahweh. Then they sat down to eat and drink wine. Then they got up and started
dancing in a very immoral way.
Yahweh threatened to destroy the Israeli people
7 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Go back down from the mountain, because your
people, the ones that you brought up here from Egypt, have already ◄become very
depraved/wicked►!
8 They have already ◄left the road that I showed them/stopped obeying me►! They
have made a statue of a young bull from melted gold. They have worshiped it and
offered sacrifices to it. And they are saying, ‘This is the god of us Israeli people! This
is the one who brought us up from Egypt!’ ”
9 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “I have seen that these people are very stubborn.
10 I am very angry with them, and so I am going to get rid of them. Do not try to
stop me! Then I will cause you and your descendants to become a great nation.”
11 But Moses/I pleaded with his/my God, Yahweh, and said, “Yahweh, ◄you should
not be very angry with your people!/why are you so angry with your people [RHQ]?►
These are the people whom you rescued from Egypt with very great power [MTY,
DOU]!
12 Do not do anything that would allow the people of Egypt to say, ‘Their god led
them out from our country, but he did that only because he wanted to kill them in
the mountains and get rid of them completely [RHQ]!’ Stop being so angry! ◄Change
your mind/Do not do what you have told me that you will do►! Do not do to your
people this terrible thing that you have just said that you will do
13 Think about your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. You solemnly promised
them, ‘I will enable you to have as many descendants as there are stars in the sky.’
You said to them, ‘I will give to your descendants all the land that I am promising to
give them. It will be their land forever.’ ”
14 So Yahweh changed his mind. He did not do to his people the terrible thing that
he said he would do.
15 Moses/I turned away from God and went down the mountain, carrying in his
hands the two stone slabs on which Yahweh had engraved his commandments. He
had written on both sides of the slabs.
16 God himself had made the slabs, and he was the one who had engraved the
commandments on them.
17 Joshua heard the very loud noise of the people shouting. So when he and I got
near the camp, Joshua said, “There is a noise in the camp that sounds like the noise
of a battle!”
18 But Moses/I replied, “No, that is not the shouting that people do when they have
won a victory or when they have been defeated in a battle What I hear is the sound
of loud singing!”
19 As soon as Moses/I came close to the camp and saw the statue of the young
bull and saw the people dancing, he/I became extremely angry. He/I threw the
stone tablets that he/I was carrying down onto the ground, there at the base of the
mountain.
20 Then he/I took the statue of the young bull that they had made and melted it in
the fire. When it cooled, he/I ground it into fine powder. Then he/I mixed the powder
with water and forced the Israeli people to drink it.
you have made them commit such a terrible sin?”
are very determined to do evil things.
23 They said to me, ‘As for that man Moses, the one who brought us up here from
the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him. So make for us an idol
that will lead us!’
EXODUS 32:24
136
EXODUS 33:4-5
24 So I said to them, ‘Everyone who is wearing gold earrings should take them off.’
So they took them off and gave them to me. I threw them into the fire, and out came
this statue of a young bull!”
25 Moses/I saw that Aaron had allowed the people to become completely out of
control and to do things that would make their enemies think the Israeli people were
foolish.
26 So he/I stood at the entrance to the camp and shouted, “Everyone who is loyal
to Yahweh should come closer to me!” So the descendants of Levi gathered around
him/me.
27 Then he/I said to them, “Yahweh, the God of us Israeli people, commands that
every one of you should fasten your sword to your side, and then go through the
camp from this entrance to the other one, and kill some of your relatives and your
companions and your neighbors.”
28 The descendants of Levi did what Moses/I told them to do, and they killed 3,000
men on that day.
29 Moses/I said to the descendants of Levi, “Today you have dedicated yourselves to
serving Yahweh by ◄killing/not sparing► even your own sons and brothers, and as a
result Yahweh will bless you.”
30 The next day, Moses/I said to the people, “You have committed a terrible sin. But
I will now climb up the mountain again to talk with Yahweh. Perhaps I can persuade
him to forgive you for sinning like this.”
31 So Moses/I went back up the mountain and said to Yahweh, “I am sorry to admit
that these people have committed a terrible sin. They have made for themselves a
gold idol and have worshiped it.
32 But now I ask you to please forgive them for having sinned. If you will not forgive
them, then erase my name from the book in which you have written the names of
33 But Yahweh said to Moses/me, “It is only those who have sinned against me whose
names I will erase from that book.
about. Keep in mind that my angel will go in front of you. But, at the time that I
35 Later Yahweh caused a plague to strike the people because they had told Aaron
to make the gold statue of a young bull.
33
Yahweh further rebuked and warned the Israeli people
1 Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Leave this place and go with the people whom you led
give to their descendants.

[IDM]. But I will not go with you myself, because if I did that, I might get rid of you
4-5 Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Tell the Israeli people, ‘You are very stubborn [IDM].
If I would go with you for even a moment, I would completely ◄get rid of you/wipe
you out►. Now take off your jewelry to show that you are sorry for having sinned.
Then I will decide how I will punish you (OR, if I should punish you).’ ” So when
EXODUS 33:6
137
EXODUS 34:1
Moses/I told to the people what God said, they started to mourn, and they all took off
their jewelry.
6 After the Israeli people left Sinai Mountain, they did not wear jewelry any more.
7 When the Israeli people traveled, whenever they stopped and set up their tents,
Moses/I had them set up a tent outside the camp, far from the camp. I called it ‘the
Sacred Tent where God and I talk together’. Everyone who wanted Yahweh to decide
something for them would go out of the camp to the Sacred Tent.
8 Whenever Moses/I went out to the Sacred Tent, all the people would stand at the
entrances of their tents and watch him/me until he/I had entered the Sacred Tent.
9 When Moses/I entered the Sacred Tent, the tall cloud that looked like a fire would
come down and stay at the entrance of the Sacred Tent, and then Yahweh would talk
with Moses/me.
10 When the people saw the tall cloud at the entrance of the Sacred Tent, they would
all prostrate themselves on the ground and worship Yahweh.
11 Yahweh would speak to Moses/me directly, like someone speaks to his friend.
Then Moses/I would return to the camp. But his/my young helper, Joshua, the son of
Nun, stayed in the Sacred Tent.
Yahweh promised to be with his people and to let Moses see his glory
12 Moses/I said to Yahweh, “It is true that you have told me, ‘Lead the people to the
land that I will show you,’ and you have said that you know me well and that you are
pleased with me, but you have not told me whom you will send with me!
13 So now, if you are truly pleased with me, I ask you, tell me the things that you
intend/plan to do, in order that I will know you better and continue to please you.
Also, do not forget that the Israeli people are the people whom you chose to belong
to you.”
14 Yahweh replied, “I will go with you, and I will give you inner peace.”
15 Moses/I replied, “If you do not go with me, do not force us to leave this place.
16 The only way that other people will know that you are pleased with me and with
your people is if you go with us [RHQ]! ◄If you go with us, that will show that we are
different from all the other people on the earth./If you do not go with us, what will
show that we are different from all the other people on the earth?►” [RHQ]
17 Yahweh replied to Moses/me, “What you have asked is exactly what I will do,
because I know you well and I am pleased with you.”
18 Then Moses/I said, “Please let me see your glorious presence!”
19 Yahweh replied, “I will let you see how great and glorious I am, and I will tell
you clearly that my name is Yahweh. I will act very kindly and be merciful to all
those whom I choose.
20 But you are not allowed to see my face, because anyone who sees my face will
◄die/not continue to stay alive►.
21 But look! Here is a place close to me where you can stand on a large rock.
22 When my glorious presence comes past you, I will put you in a large crevice/
opening in the rock, and I will cover your face with my hand until I have passed by.
23 Then I will take my hand away, and you will see my back, but you will not see
my face.”
34
Yahweh gave Moses another copy of his commandments
1 Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Cut two slabs of stone that will be like the first slabs,
the ones that you broke. Then I will engrave on them the words that were on the
first slabs.
EXODUS 34:2
138
EXODUS 34:19
2 Get ready tomorrow morning, and come up to the top of Sinai Mountain again to
talk with me there.
3 Do not allow anyone to come up with you. I do not want anyone else to be
anywhere on the mountain. Do not allow any sheep or cattle to graze ◄at the base
of/near► the mountain.”
4 So Moses/I cut two slabs of stone that were like the first ones. He/I arose early the
Sinai Mountain, as Yahweh had commanded.
proclaimed that it was he, Yahweh, who was going to speak to Moses/me.
6 Then Yahweh passed in front of him/me and proclaimed, “I am Yahweh God. I
always act mercifully and kindly toward people. I do not get angry quickly. I truly
love people and I do what I promise to do for them, without changing.
7 I love people for thousands of generations. I forgive people for all kinds of sins
[TRI]. But I will certainly punish [LIT] those who are guilty. I will punish not only
them, but I will punish ◄their descendants, down to the third and fourth generation/
their children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren►.”
8 Moses/I quickly prostrated himself/myself on the ground and worshiped Yahweh.
9 He/I said, “Yahweh, if you are now pleased with me, I ask that you go with us.
These people are very stubborn [IDM], but forgive us for all our sins [DOU], and accept
us to be people who belong to you forever.”
10 Yahweh replied, “Note this: I am going to make a solemn agreement with the
Israeli people. As they are watching, I will perform great miracles. They will be
miracles that no one has ever done on the earth in any nation. All the people who
are near you will see the great things that I, Yahweh, will do. I will do awesome
things for you all.
11-12 Each Israeli person must obey what I am commanding you this day. Do not
forget that if you obey me, I will expel the Amor, Canaan, Heth, Periz, Hiv, and
Jebus people-groups from the land. But be careful that you do not make any peace
agreements with any of the people who live in the land into which you are going,
because if you do that, you will begin to do the evil things that they do. It will be like
falling into a trap.
13 You must tear down their altars, destroy their sacred pillars, and cut down the
poles that they use to worship their female goddess Asherah.
14 You must worship only me, and not worship any other god, because I, Yahweh,
cannot endure any rivals.
15 Do not make peace agreements with any group that lives in that land. When they
worship their gods and offer sacrifices to their gods, and they invite you to join them,
do not join them. If you join them, you will eat the food that they sacrifice to their
gods, and you will not be faithful to me. You will be like people who commit adultery,
who are not being faithful to their spouses [MET].
16 If you take some of their women to be wives for your sons, and these women
worship their own gods, they will persuade your sons also to worship their gods.
17 Do not pour melted metal into molds to make statues for you to worship.
18 Each year, during the month of/named Abib, celebrate the Festival of Eating Bread
Made Without Yeast. During that festival, for seven days you must not eat bread made
with yeast, as I commanded you, because it was in that month that you left Egypt.

goats belong to me.

must bring an offering to me [LIT] each time you come to worship me.
Even during the times when you plow the ground and harvest your crops, you must
rest on the seventh day.
22 Each year celebrate the Harvest Festival, when you begin to harvest the first crop
of wheat, and also celebrate the Festival of Living in Temporary Shelters, when you
finish harvesting the grain and fruit.
23 Three times each year all the men must come to worship me, Yahweh, the God
of the Israeli people.
24 I will expel the people-groups that live in the land where you will be, and I will
cause your territory to become very large. As a result, no group will try to conquer
your country if you come to worship me each year during those three festivals.
25 When you sacrifice an animal [MTY] to me, do not offer with it bread that is
made with yeast. And during the Passover Festival, when you sacrifice lambs, do not
keep any of the meat until the next morning.
26 I am Yahweh God. You must bring to my Sacred Tent the first part of the grain
that you harvest each year. When you kill a young animal/kid either a lamb or a calf,
do not prepare to eat it by boiling it in its mother’s milk.”
27 Yahweh also said to Moses/me, “Write down the words that I have told you. By
giving you these commands, I have made a solemn agreement with you and with the
28 Moses/I was there on the top of the mountain with Yahweh for 40 days and nights.
During that time he/I did not eat or drink anything [SYN]. He/I engraved on the stone
slabs the words of the Ten Commandments, which were part of Yahweh’s solemn
agreement.
Moses’ face was shining as he returned to the people
29 When Moses/I came back down the mountain, carrying in his/my hand the two
stone slabs on which were written the Ten Commandments, his/my face was shining
because he/I had been talking with Yahweh, but he/I did not know that his/my face
was shining.
30 When Aaron and the other Israeli people saw Moses/me, they were amazed/
surprised that his/my face was shining. So they were afraid to come near him/me.
31 But Moses/I called to them. Then Aaron and the other Israeli leaders came to
him/me, and he/I talked with them.
32 Afterwards, all the other Israeli people came near, and he/I told them all the laws
that Yahweh had given to him/me on Sinai Mountain.
33 When Moses/I finished talking to the people, he/I put a veil over his/my face.
34 But whenever Moses/I entered the Sacred Tent to talk with Yahweh, he/I removed
the veil. When he/I came back out, he/I would always tell to the Israeli people
everything that Yahweh had commanded him/me to tell them.
35 The Israeli people would see that Moses’/my face was still shining. Then he/I
would put the veil back on his/my face again until the next time that he/I went into
the Sacred Tent to talk with Yahweh.
35
Regulations for the day of rest
EXODUS 35:1
2 Each week you may work for six days, but on the seventh day you must rest. It is
a sacred day, dedicated to Yahweh. Anyone who does any work on the seventh day
must be executed.
3 Do not even light a fire in your homes on days of rest.”
Gifts for constructing the Sacred Tent
also said to all the Israeli people, “This is also what Yahweh has
commanded:
5 Make offerings to Yahweh. Everyone who wants to should bring to Yahweh an
offering. These are the things that they may offer: Gold, silver, bronze,
6 fine white linen, blue or purple or red cloth, cloth made from goats’ hair,
7 rams’ skins that are ◄tanned/dyed red►, fine leather made from goatskins, wood
from acacia trees,
8 oil for the lamps, spices to put in the olive oil for anointing and in the sweetsmelling incense,
9 valuable onyx stones or other valuable stones to fasten onto the priest’s sacred
apron and put on his sacred chest pouch.
10 “All the skilled workers among you should come and make all the things that
Yahweh has commanded:
11 The Sacred Tent and its covering, its fasteners and its frames, its crossbars, its
posts, its bases,
12 the sacred chest with its poles and its lid, the curtain that will separate the Holy
Place from the Very Holy Place,
13 the table with the poles for carrying it and all the things that will be used with
the table, the sacred bread that will be offered to God,
14 the lampstand for the lamps with all the things that will be used to take care of
them, the oil for the lamps,
15 the altar for burning incense, and the poles for carrying that altar, the oil for
anointing and the sweet-smelling incense, the curtain for the entrance of the Sacred
Tent,
16 the altar for offering sacrifices that will be completely burned and its bronze
grating, the poles for carrying that altar and all the things that will be used with it,
the washbasin and its base,
17 the curtains to surround the courtyard and the posts and bases for the posts from
which to hang the curtains, the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard,
18 the pegs and ropes for the Sacred Tent and for the courtyard,
19 and the beautiful clothes that Aaron and his sons are to wear when they do their
work in the Holy Place.”
20 Then all the Israeli people returned to their tents.
21 Everyone who wanted to brought an offering to Yahweh. They brought some of
the things that would be used to make the Sacred Tent and all the other items that
would be used in the rituals, and the materials to make the sacred clothes for the
priests.
22 All the men and women who wanted to brought gold ornaments, earrings, rings,
necklaces, and many other kinds of things made of gold, and they dedicated them to
Yahweh.
23 And many [HYP] people who had blue, purple, or red cloth or fine white linen or
cloth made from goats’ hair or rams’ skins that were ◄tanned/dyed red► or leather
made from goatskins brought some of these things.
4 Moses/ I

EXODUS 36:9
24 All those who had silver or bronze brought them as offerings to Yahweh.
All
those who had some acacia wood that could be used for any of the work brought it.
25 All the women who were skilled to make cloth brought fine linen thread and
blue, purple, or red yarn/thread that they had made/spun.
26 And all the women who wanted to made/spun thread from goats’ hair.
27 All the leaders brought valuable onyx stones and other valuable stones to be
fastened to Aaron’s sacred apron and his sacred chest pouch.
28 They also brought spices to put in the sweet-smelling incense, and they brought
olive oil for the lamps and for the oil for anointing and for putting in the sweetsmelling incense.
29 All the Israeli men and women who wanted to brought these things to offer them
to Yahweh, for doing the work that he had commanded Moses/me to do.
Moses’ instructions regarding Bezalel and Oholiab
30 Moses/I said to the Israeli people, “Listen carefully. Yahweh has chosen Bezalel,
the son of Uri and grandson of Hur, from the tribe of Judah.
ability and enabled him to know how to do very skilled work.
33 He can cut ◄jewels/valuable stones► and enclose them in tiny gold frames. He
34 Yahweh has also given to him and to Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, from the
tribe of Dan, the ability to teach their skills to others.
35 He has given to them the ability to do all kinds of work that is done by
craftsmen—those who create artistic things, those who make fine white linen, those
who embroider designs using blue or purple or red yarn/thread, and those who make
other cloth. They are able to do many [HYP] kinds of skillful work.
36
1 “Bezalel and Oholiab, and all the other men to whom Yahweh has given ability
and enabled them to understand how to do all the work to make the Sacred Tent,
must make everything just as Yahweh has commanded.”
2 So Moses/I summoned Bezalel and Oholiab and all the other skilled men to whom
Yahweh had given special ability and who wanted to do some of the work.
3 Moses/I gave them all the things that the people had brought as offerings to
Yahweh for making the Sacred Tent. But the people continued bringing more things
every morning.
4 As a result, the skilled men who were doing various things to make the Sacred
Tent came to Moses/me
5 and said, “The people are bringing more than we need to do the work that Yahweh
has commanded us!”
6 So Moses/I gave the skilled men this message that was proclaimed throughout the
camp: “No one should bring anything more as an offering to make the Sacred Tent!”
When the people heard that, they did not bring anything more.
7 What they had already brought was enough to do all the work. In fact, it was
more than was needed!
They made the curtains and coverings for the Sacred Tent
8 All the most skilled men among the workmen made the Sacred Tent. They made
it from ten strips of fine linen, and carefully embroidered it using blue, purple, and
red yarn/thread to make figures that resembled the winged creatures.
9 Each strip was ◄14 yards/twelve meters► long and ◄2 yards/1.8 meters► wide.
EXODUS 36:10
142
EXODUS 36:35
10 They sewed five strips together to make one set, and they sewed the other five
strips together to make the other set.
11 For each set, they made loops of blue cloth and fastened them on the outer edge
of the strip, at the end of each set.
12 They put 50 loops on the edge of the first set, and 50 loops on the edge of the
second set.
13 They made 50 gold clasps/fasteners, to fasten both of the sets together. In that
way, the inside of the Sacred Tent was as though it was one piece.
14 They made a cover for the Sacred Tent from eleven pieces of cloth made from
goats’ hair.

the one set and they fastened 50 to the outer edge of the other set.
18 They made 50 bronze clasps/fasteners and joined the two sets together with them.
In that way it formed one cover.
19 They made two more covers for the Sacred Tent. They made one from rams’
skins that had been ◄tanned/dyed red►, and they made the top cover from goatskin
leather.
20 They made 48 frames from acacia wood and set them up to support the covers
for the Sacred Tent.
21 Each frame was ◄15 feet/4.5 meters► long and ◄27 in./66 cm.► wide.
22 They made two projections at the bottom of each frame. These were for fastening
the frames to the bases underneath them. Each frame had these projections.
23 The skilled workmen made twenty frames for the south side of the Sacred Tent.
24 They made 40 silver bases to go underneath them. Two bases went under each
frame. The projections on each frame fit into these bases.
25 Similarly, they made 20 frames for the north side of the Sacred Tent.
26 They made 40 silver bases for them also, with two bases for under each frame.
27 For the rear of the Sacred Tent, on the west side, they made six frames.
28 They also made two extra frames, one for each corner of the rear of the Sacred
Tent, to provide extra support.
29 The two corner frames were joined from the bottom to the top (OR, joined at both
the bottom and the top). At the top of each of the two corner frames they fastened a
gold ring for holding the crossbar.
30 In that way, for the rear of the Sacred Tent there were eight frames, and there
were 16 bases, two bases under each frame.
31 The workmen made 15 crossbars from acacia wood.
32 Five of them were for the frames on the north side of the Sacred Tent, five for
the south side, and five for the frames at the rear of the Sacred Tent, the west side.
33 The crossbars on the north, south, and west sides of the Sacred Tent were fastened
to the middle of the frames. The two long crossbars extended from one end of the
Sacred Tent to the other, and the crossbar on the west side extended from one side
of the Sacred Tent to the other side.
34 The workmen covered the frames with gold and fastened gold rings to the poles.
The crossbars were put into the rings. The crossbars were also covered with gold.
35 They made a curtain from fine white linen. Skilled craftsmen embroidered it
with blue, purple, and red yarn/thread, making designs that resembled the winged
creatures.

7 He made two winged creatures from hammered gold.
8 One of these was put at each end of the chest. The gold with which they were made
was joined to the gold from which the lid was made.
9 He placed the winged creatures facing each other so that their wings touched each
other and spread out over the lid.
Bezalel made the table
10 Bezalel made a table from acacia wood. It was ◄36 in./88 cm.► long, ◄18 in./44
cm.► wide, and ◄27 in./66 cm.► high.
11 He covered it with pure gold, and he put a gold border around it.
12 He made a rim all around it, ◄3 in./7 cm.► wide. He put a gold border around
the rim.
13 He made/cast four rings from gold and fastened the rings to the four corners of
the table, one ring close to each leg of the table.
14 The rings were fastened to the table near the rim.
15 He made two poles from acacia wood and covered them with gold. These poles
for carrying the table were then inserted into the rings.
16 He also made from pure gold all the things to be put on the table. He made the
plates, the cups, and the jars and bowls to be used when the priests poured out wine
as an offering to Yahweh.
17 He made the lampstand from pure gold. Its base and its shaft were hammered
from one large lump of gold. The branches of the lampstand, the cups for holding the
oil, the flower buds and the petals that decorated the branches of the lamp, the base,
and the shaft were all hammered from one big lump of gold.
18 There were six branches on the lampstand, three on each side of the shaft.
19 Each of the branches had on it three gold decorations that looked like almond
blossoms. These decorations also had flower buds and flower petals.
20 On the shaft of the lampstand there were four gold decorations that also looked
like almond blossoms, each one with flower buds and flower petals.

things that were used to take care of it.
Bezalel made the altar for burning incense
25 From acacia wood, Bezalel made the altar for burning incense.
It was square,
◄18 in./45 cm.► on each side. It was ◄3 ft./90 cm.► high. He made a projection that
looked like a horn on each of the top corners. The projections were carved from the
same block of wood that the altar was made of.
26 He covered the top and the four sides, including the projections, with pure gold.
He put a gold border around the altar, near the top.
27 He made two gold rings for carrying the altar. Then he attached them to the altar
below the border, one on each side of the altar. The poles by means of which the altar
was to be carried were to be inserted into those rings.
28 He made those two poles from acacia wood and covered them with gold.
29 He also made the sacred oil for anointing and the pure sweet-smelling incense.
He mixed the incense together as a skilled perfumer would.
38
They made the altar for burning sacrifices, and they made the washbasin
They made
it from acacia wood. It was square, ◄7-1/2 feet/2.2 meters► on each side, and it was
◄4-1/2 feet/1.3 meters► high.
2 They made a projection that looked like a horn on each of the top corners. The
projections were carved from the same block of wood that the altar was made of.
They covered the whole altar with bronze.
3 They made the pans in which to put the greasy ashes from the animal sacrifices.
They also made the shovels for cleaning out the ashes. They made the basins and
forks for turning the meat as it cooked, and buckets for carrying hot coals/ashes. All
of those things were made from bronze.
4 They also made a bronze grating to hold the wood and burning coals. They put
the grating under the rim that went around the altar. They made it so that it was
inside the altar, halfway down.
5 They made bronze rings in which to put the poles for carrying the altar, and
fastened one of them to each of the corners of the altar.
6 They made the poles from acacia wood and covered them with bronze.
7 They put the poles through the rings on each side of the altar. The poles were for
carrying the altar.
8 The altar was hollow like an empty box. It was made from boards of acacia wood.
They made/cast the washbasin and its base from bronze. The bronze was from the
mirrors that belonged to the women who worked at the entrance of the Sacred Tent.
1 Several men helped Bezalel to make the altar for burning sacrifices.
They made curtains to surround the courtyard
EXODUS 38:9
To form the
courtyard, they made curtains of fine white linen. On the south side, the curtain was
◄150 feet/46 meters► long.
10 To hang the curtain, they made 20 bronze posts and 20 bronze bases, one for
under each post. To fasten the curtains to the posts, they made silver hooks, and they
made metal rods covered with silver.
11 They made the same kind of curtains, posts, bases, and hooks for the north side
of the courtyard.
12 On the west side of the courtyard, they made a curtain ◄75 feet/23 meters► long.
They also made ten posts on which to hang the curtains, and ten bases, with silver
hooks and metal rods covered with silver.
13 On the east side, where the entrance is, the courtyard was ◄75 feet/23 meters►
wide.
14-15 On each side of the entrance, they made a curtain ◄22-1/2 feet/6.6 meters►
wide. On each side they were hung from three posts, and one base was under each
post.
16 All the curtains around the courtyard were made from fine white linen.
17 All the posts around the courtyard were made of bronze, but the tops were
covered with silver. The posts were connected with metal rods covered with silver.
The clasps/fasteners and hooks were made of silver.
18 For the entrance of the courtyard, they made a curtain from fine white linen,
and a skilled weaver embroidered it with blue, purple, and red yarn/thread. The
curtain was ◄30 feet/9 meters► long and ◄7-1/2 feet/2.3 meters► high, just like the
other curtains around the courtyard.
19 All the curtains were made of fine white linen. They were supported by four
posts, and under each post was a base made of bronze. All the posts around the
courtyard were connected with metal rods covered with silver. The clasps/fasteners
were made of silver, and the tops of the posts were covered with silver.
20 All the tent pegs to support the Sacred Tent and the curtains around the courtyard
were made of bronze.
A list of the materials used
21 Here is a list of the amounts of metal used to make the Sacred Tent. Moses/I told
some men from the tribe of Levi to count all the materials used and write down the
amounts. Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest, supervised those men.
22 Bezalel the son of Uri and grandson of Hur made all the things that Yahweh
commanded Moses/me to be made.
23 Bezalel’s helper was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. Oholiab
was a skilled engraver who made artistic things. He made fine white linen, and he
embroidered designs using blue, purple, and red yarn/thread. He also made other
cloth.
24 All the gold that was used to make the Sacred Tent weighed ◄2,195 pounds/1,000
kg.►. They used the official standard when they weighed the gold.
25 All the silver that the people contributed when the leaders ◄took the census/
counted the men► weighed ◄7,500 pounds/3,400 kg.►. They also used the official
standard when they weighed the silver.
26 All the men who were at least 20 years old were counted, and they each paid the
required amount. That was a total of 603,550 men.

28 Bezalel and his helpers used the ◄50 pounds/30 kg.► of silver that was not used
for the bases to make the rods and the hooks for the posts, and to cover the tops of
the posts.
29 The bronze that the people contributed weighed ◄5,310 pounds/2,425 kg.►.
30 With the bronze, Bezalel and his helpers made the bases for under the posts at
the entrance of the Sacred Tent. They also made the altar for burning sacrifices, the
grating for it and the tools used with it,
31 the bases for the posts that supported the curtains that surrounded the courtyard
and the bases for the entrance to the courtyard, and the pegs for the Sacred Tent and
for the curtains around the courtyard.
39
They made the sacred clothes for Aaron
1 Bezalel, Oholiab, and the other skilled workmen made the beautiful clothes for
Aaron to wear while he did his work as a priest in the Holy Place. They made them
from blue, purple, and red cloth, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.
2 They made the sacred apron from fine white linen and from blue, purple, and red
cloth.
3 They hammered some thin sheets of gold and cut them into thin strips which they
embroidered into the fine linen and into the blue, purple, and red cloth.
4 The apron had two shoulder straps, to join the front part to the back part at the
shoulders.
5 A carefully-woven sash, which was made from the same materials as the sacred
apron, was sewn onto the sacred apron. This was made exactly as Yahweh had
commanded Moses/me.
6 They cut two valuable onyx stones and enclosed them in a tiny gold frame, and a
skilled gem-cutter engraved on the stones the names of the twelve sons of Jacob.
7 They fastened the stones to the shoulder straps of the sacred apron, to represent
the twelve Israeli tribes, exactly as Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.
8 They made the sacred chest pouch. They made it of the same materials as the
sacred apron and embroidered it in the same way.
9 It was square, and the material was folded double, so that it was ◄9 in./22 cm.►
long and ◄9 in./22 cm.► wide.
10 They fastened four rows of valuable stones onto the pouch. In the first row, they
put a red ruby, a yellow topaz, and a red garnet.
11 In the second row, they put a green emerald, a blue sapphire, and a clear/white
diamond.
12 In the third row they put a red jacinth, a white agate, and a purple amethyst.
13 In the fourth row, they put a yellow beryl, a red carnelian, and a green jasper.
They set each of the stones in tiny gold frames.

sacred pouch.
17 They fastened one end of each cord to one of the rings.
18 They fastened the other end of each cord to the two ◄settings/tiny frames► that
enclosed the stones. Then they attached the sacred pouch to the shoulder straps of
the sacred apron.
EXODUS 39:19
147
19 Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the lower corners of
the sacred pouch, on the inside edges, next to the sacred apron.
20 They made two more gold rings and attached them to the lower part of the front
of the shoulder straps, near to where the shoulder straps were joined to the sacred
apron, just above the carefully-woven sash/waistband.
21 They tied the rings on the sacred pouch to the rings on the sacred apron with
a blue cord, so that the sacred pouch was above the sash/waistband and would not
come loose from the sacred apron.
They made other special clothes for the priests
22 They made the robe that is to be worn underneath the priest’s sacred apron,
using only blue cloth.
23 It had an opening through which the priest would put his head. They sewed a
border around this opening, to prevent the material from tearing.
24 At the lower edge on the robe, they fastened decorations that resembled
pomegranate fruit. The decorations were woven from blue, purple, and red yarn/
thread.
25 Between each of these decorations, they fastened a tiny bell made from pure
gold, so there was a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, alternating
all around the hem of the robe
26 for Aaron to wear while he did his work as a priest. They made all these things
exactly as Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.
27 They wove long-sleeved tunics/gowns from fine white linen, for Aaron and his
sons.
28 They also made a turban of fine linen for Aaron to wear around his head. They
made the caps and the undershorts for Aaron’s sons from fine linen.
29 They made the embroidered sash/waistband for Aaron from fine linen and from
blue, purple, and red cloth, and they embroidered designs on it using blue, purple,
and red yarn/thread, exactly as Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.
30 They also made the tiny ornament of pure gold and had a skilled workman
engrave on it the words, ‘Dedicated to Yahweh’.
31 They fastened this to the front of the turban by a blue cord, just as Yahweh had
commanded Moses/me.
32 Finally they finished all the work to make the Sacred Tent. They brought to
Moses/me all the things that they had made. They had made them exactly as Yahweh
had commanded me.
33 They brought to him/me the Sacred Tent and all the things that were used with
34 the coverings for the Sacred Tent that were made of tanned/dyed rams’ skins and
35 the sacred chest that contained the stone slabs on which the commandments were
36 the table with all the things that were used with it, the sacred bread that was
offered to God,
37 the lampstand made of pure gold and all its lamps and all the things that were
to be used to take care of it, the oil for the lamps,
38 the golden altar for burning incense, the oil for anointing, the sweet-smelling
incense, the curtain for the entrance to the Sacred Tent,
39 the bronze altar for burning sacrifices and its bronze grating, the poles for carrying
it, and all the other things that were used with it, the washbasin and its base,

EXODUS 40:20
40 the curtains that surrounded the courtyard, the posts and bases that supported
them, the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard and its ropes, the tent pegs, and
all the other things that would be used in the Sacred Tent,
41 the beautiful sacred clothes for Aaron to wear when he did his work in the Holy
Place, and the special clothes for his sons to wear as they did their work as priests.
42 The Israeli people had done all this work exactly as Yahweh had commanded
Moses/me.
43 Then Moses/ I saw all the work that they had done. Truly, they had done
everything exactly as Yahweh had commanded that it should be done. Then Moses/I
asked God to bless them.
40
They set up the Sacred Tent
1 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me,
2 “On the first day of the first month next year, tell the people to set up the Sacred
Tent.
3 Put inside it the sacred chest that contains the stone slabs on which are engraved
the Ten Commandments, and hang the curtain in front of it.
4 Bring the table into the Sacred Tent, and place on it all the things that are to be
used with it. Bring in the lampstand and fasten the lamps to it.
5 Put the gold altar for burning incense in front of the sacred chest, and set up the
curtain at the entrance of the Sacred Tent.
6 Put the altar for burning sacrifices in front of the Sacred Tent.
7 Put the washbasin between the Sacred Tent and the altar, and fill it with water.
8 Hang the curtains that will surround the courtyard, and hang the curtain at its
entrance.
9 Then take the oil for anointing, and anoint the Sacred Tent and everything that is
in it, to ◄set it apart/dedicate it► to me. Then it will be holy/sacred.
10 Also anoint the altar for offering sacrifices that will be completely burned, and
all the things that will be used with it, and set it apart. Then it also will be holy/
sacred.

14 Also bring his sons there. Put their sacred tunics/gowns on them
15 and anoint them just as you anointed their father, in order that they also may
serve me by working as priests. By anointing them and their descendants, you will
cause them and their descendants to be priests throughout all coming generations.”
16 Moses/I did all these things exactly as Yahweh had commanded him/me.
17 On the first day of the first month of the next year (OR, second year after they/we
left Egypt), the people set up the Sacred Tent.
18 Following Moses’/my instructions, they set up the Sacred Tent and its bases, set
up the frames, attached the crossbars, and put up the posts for the curtains.
19 Then they spread out the coverings over the Sacred Tent, exactly as Yahweh had
commanded.
20 Then he/I took the two stone slabs on which the commandments were written and
put them in the sacred chest. He/I put the carrying poles in the rings on the chest and
put the lid on top of the chest.
EXODUS 40:21
149
EXODUS 40:38
21 Then he/I took the chest into the Very Holy Place inside the Sacred Tent and hung
the curtain. In that way, he/I prevented the people who were outside from seeing the
chest. He/I did all this exactly as Yahweh had commanded him/me.
22 He/I set the table inside the Sacred Tent, on the north side, outside the curtain.
23 He/I placed on the table the bread that was offered to Yahweh, exactly as Yahweh
had commanded.
24 He/I set the lampstand inside the Sacred Tent, on the south side, opposite the
table.
25 Then he/I fastened the lamps to the lampstand in Yahweh’s presence, exactly as
Yahweh had commanded.
26 He/I set the golden altar for burning incense inside the Sacred Tent, in front of
the curtain that separated the Holy Place from the Very Holy Place,
27 and he/ I burned some sweet-smelling incense on it, exactly as Yahweh had
commanded him/me.
28 He/I hung the curtain at the entrance to the Sacred Tent.
29 At the entrance to the Sacred Tent, he/I set the altar for offering sacrifices that
were to be burned completely. Then he/I offered on it the meat that was to be burned
completely and the grain offering, exactly as Yahweh had commanded him/me.
30 He/I set the washbasin between the Sacred Tent and the bronze altar, and he/I
filled the washbasin with water.
31-32 Every time Moses/I and Aaron and his sons went into the Sacred Tent or went
to the altar, they/we washed their/our hands and feet ritually, exactly as Yahweh had
commanded Moses/me.
33 Following Moses’/my instructions, they hung the curtains that surrounded the
courtyard and the altar, and they hung the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard.
So Moses/I finished that work.
Yahweh’s brilliant light filled the Sacred Tent
light► filled the Sacred Tent.
36 From that day, whenever the Israeli people wanted to move to another place,
37 If the cloud did not rise, they stayed where they were and did not go on until the
38 Wherever they traveled, the bright cloud that indicated Yahweh’s presence was
above the Sacred Tent during the day, and a bright fire was inside the cloud at night,
with the result that all the Israeli people [MTY] could see it at any time.

laws for his people
Leviticus
The burnt offering
1 While Moses/I was standing near the entrance to the Sacred Tent, Yahweh called
to him/me from inside the tent. He said to Moses/me,
2 “Tell this to the Israeli people: ‘When any of you brings an offering to Yahweh,
bring one of your sheep or goats or cattle.
3 ‘If what you are offering is a bull that will be completely burned on the altar, it
must not have any defects. You must take it to the entrance to the Sacred Tent, in
order that it will be acceptable to Yahweh.
4 You must lay your hands on the head of the bull. When you do that, Yahweh
will accept its death in your place to forgive/pardon you for the sins that you have
committed.
5 You must slaughter the bull in front of Yahweh. Then Aaron’s sons, who are
priests, will bring the blood and sprinkle it against all sides of the altar near the
entrance to the Sacred Tent.
6 You must remove the skin of the animal and cut the animal into pieces. You must
wash the inner parts and the legs of the bull.
7 Then Aaron’s sons will put wood on the altar and light a fire.
8 Then they will arrange the pieces, including the head and the fat, on the burning
wood.
9 Then one of the priests will completely burn all of it on the altar. And the aroma
will be pleasing to Yahweh.
10 ‘If you are offering a sheep or a goat, it must be a male without any defect.
11 You must slaughter it in front of Yahweh, on the north side of the altar, and drain
all the blood into a bowl. Then Aaron’s sons will sprinkle the blood against all sides
of the altar.
12 You must cut the animal into pieces. You must wash the inner parts and the legs
of the animal. Then the priests will arrange the pieces, including the head and the
fat, on the burning wood.
13 Then one of the priests will take all of it and completely burn all of it on the altar.
And the aroma as it burns will be pleasing to Yahweh.
14 ‘If what you are offering to Yahweh is a bird, you must offer a dove or a young
pigeon.
15 The priest will take it to the altar and wring/twist off its head. Then he will burn
16 Then he will remove the bird’s ◄craw/food-grinding pouch► and what is inside
17 Then he will grasp the bird’s wings and partially tear the bird open. Then he will
burn it completely in the fire on the altar. And the aroma will be pleasing to Yahweh.’

The grain offering
1 ‘If you bring to Yahweh an offering of grain, it must consist of finely-ground flour.
You must pour olive oil on it, and put some incense on it,

151
the oil with the incense and burn it on the altar. That part will symbolize that all of
3 The part of that offering that is not burned will belong to Aaron and his sons. It is
a very holy part of the offerings that are given to Yahweh by burning them in a fire.
4 ‘If you bring an offering that is made from grain, something that is baked in an
oven, it must be made from finely-ground flour. You may bring loaves made from
flour mixed with olive oil but without yeast, or you may bring wafers with olive oil
smeared on them, but also made without yeast.
5 If your offering is cooked ◄on a griddle/in a shallow pan►, it must be made from
finely-ground flour mixed with olive oil and without yeast.
6 You must crumble it and pour olive oil on it. That will be your offering made from
grain.
7 If your offering that is made from grain is cooked in a pan, it must be made of
finely-ground flour mixed with olive oil.
8 Bring to Yahweh your grain offering. Give it to the priest, and he will take it to
the altar.
9 He will take a part of it that will symbolize that all the offering belongs to Yahweh.
He will burn that part on the altar, and the aroma as it burns will be pleasing to
Yahweh.
10 The part that is not burned will belong to Aaron and his sons. It is a very holy
part of the offerings given to Yahweh by burning them in a fire.
11 ‘Every offering that is made from grain and that you bring to Yahweh must be
made without yeast, because you must not put any yeast or honey in any offering to
Yahweh that is burned on the altar.
12 You may bring to Yahweh an offering of the first part of your harvest, but that is
not to be burned on the altar to produce an aroma that will be pleasing to Yahweh.
13 Put salt on all your offerings that are made from grain. The salt represents the
agreement that your God made with you, so be sure that you do not forget to put salt
on those offerings.
14 ‘If you bring to Yahweh an offering of the first part of your harvest of grain, offer
some new grain that has been crushed and roasted in a fire.
15 Put olive oil and incense on it, and that will be your offering made from grain.
16 The priest will take a part of the flour and oil along with the incense. That will
symbolize that all the offering truly belongs to Yahweh. He will burn that part on the
altar, to be an offering given to Yahweh by burning it in a fire.’ ”

The fellowship offering
1 “Also tell the people, ‘When the offering that you bring to Yahweh is to maintain
good fellowship with him, you may bring a bull or a cow from your herd of cattle, but
what you present to Yahweh must be an animal that has no defects.
2 You must bring the animal to the entrance to the Sacred Tent. You must lay your
hands on its head. Then you must slaughter it and drain some of its blood in a bowl.
Then one of Aaron’s sons, one of the priests, will sprinkle the blood against all sides
of the altar.
3 From that offering, you must offer to Yahweh, as a sacrifice that will be burned
in the fire, all the fat that covers the inner parts of the animal, or which is attached
to them—
152
LEVITICUS 4:7
4 the kidneys and the fat that is attached to them near the lower back muscle, and
the fat that covers the liver.
5 Then one of the priests will burn those things on the altar, along with the other
parts of the animal that will be completely burned to be an offering to Yahweh. And
the aroma while it burns will be pleasing to Yahweh.
6 If that offering to maintain good fellowship with Yahweh is a sheep or a goat, it
must also be an animal that has no defects.
7 If you offer a lamb, you must present it to Yahweh at the entrance to the Sacred
Tent. You must lay your hands on the lamb’s head and then slaughter it. ‘You must
drain some of its blood in a bowl.
8 Then one of the priests will sprinkle that blood against all sides of the altar.
9 You must dedicate these things to be a sacrifice to Yahweh that is burned: Its fat,
the fat tail that you must cut off close to the backbone, and all the fat that covers the
inner parts of the lamb or which is attached to them—
10 the kidneys with the fat that is on them near the lower back muscle, and the fat
that covers the liver.
11 One of the priests will burn those things on the altar to be an offering to Yahweh;
it will be as though they will be a special food given to Yahweh.
12 ‘If your offering is a goat, you must take/present it to Yahweh.
13 You must lay your hands on its head. Then you must slaughter it in front of the
Sacred Tent. Then one of Aaron’s sons will sprinkle the blood against all sides of the
altar.
14 From that offering you must dedicate these things to be a sacrifice to Yahweh that
is burned: All the fat that covers the inner parts of the animal or which is attached
to them,

that covers the liver.
be as though they will be a special food given to Yahweh. And the aroma while it

wherever you live: You must not eat the fat or the blood of any animal.’ ”

The sin offering
1 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me,
2 “Say this to the Israeli people: This is what must be done if someone sins without
intending to sin, doing something that is forbidden in any of Yahweh’s commands.
3 'If the Supreme [MTY] Priest sins, and that causes all the people to be guilty, he
must bring to Yahweh a young bull that has no defects. That will be an offering for
the sin that he has committed.
4 He must bring the bull to the entrance to the Sacred Tent. He must lay his hands
on its head. Then he must slaughter it in front of Yahweh and drain some of the blood
into a bowl.
5 Then the Supreme Priest must take some of that blood into the Sacred Tent.
6 He must dip one of his fingers into the blood and sprinkle it seven times in the
presence of Yahweh, in front of the curtain that separates the Holy Place from the
Very Holy Place.
7 Then he must put some of the blood on the projections at the corners of the altar
where fragrant incense is burned in the Sacred Tent in the presence of Yahweh. The

base of the altar, where sacrifices are burned, at the entrance to the Sacred Tent.
8 From that offering the Supreme Priest must separate these things from the bull
that is to be burned: The fat that covers the inner parts of the bull or which is attached
to them—
9 the kidneys and the fat that is attached to them near the lower back muscle, and
the fat that covers the liver.
10 Then the Supreme Priest must completely burn those things on the altar. That
will be just like when the fat is removed from an animal that is sacrificed to maintain
good fellowship with Yahweh.
11 But all the other parts of the animal—its skin/hide and all its other meat, its head
and its legs, its inner parts and the intestines,
12 he must take outside the camp and throw them in a place that is acceptable to
Yahweh, where the ashes are thrown, and he must burn them in a fire on the pile of
ashes.
13 ‘If all the Israeli people sin without intending to sin, doing something that is
forbidden in any of Yahweh’s commands, they will be guilty, even if they do not
realize that they have sinned.
14 When they realize that they have committed a sin, together they must bring a
young bull to be an offering for their sin, to the front of the Sacred Tent.
15 The elders must lay their hands on the bull’s head in the presence of Yahweh
and slaughter it and catch some of the blood in a bowl.

entrance of the Sacred Tent.
19 He must remove all the animal’s fat and burn it on the altar.
20 He must do with this bull the same things that he did with the bull that was an
offering for his own sins, and they will be forgiven {Yahweh will forgive them}.
21 Then the priest must take the other parts of the bull outside the camp and burn
them, like he does when he himself has sinned. That will be the offering for the sin
that all the people have committed, and they will be forgiven.
22 ‘When one of the leaders sins without intending to sin, doing something that is
forbidden in any of the commands of Yahweh his God, he will be guilty.

male goat that has no defects.
24 He must lay his hands on the goat’s head in the presence of Yahweh and slaughter
it at the place where they slaughter {are slaughtered} the animals that will be
completely burned on the altar. That will be an offering for his sin.
25 Then the priest must put some of the animal’s blood into a bowl and dip one of
his fingers in it and put some of the blood on the corners of the projections of the
altar. Then he must pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
26 Then he must burn all the fat on the altar, as was done with the fat of the offering
to maintain good fellowship with Yahweh. As a result of the priest’s doing that, the
leader will no longer be guilty for his sin and he will be forgiven.

LEVITICUS 5:8
27 ‘If one of the Israeli people who is not a priest sins without intending to sin, and
does something that is forbidden in any of the commands of Yahweh his God, he will
be guilty.
28 When he realizes that he has committed a sin, he must bring as his offering a
female goat that has no defects.
29 He must lay his hands on the goat’s head and slaughter it at the place where they
slaughter the animals that will be completely burned on the altar, and catch some of
the blood in a bowl.
30 Then the priest must dip one of his fingers in the blood, and put some of it on the
projections at the corners of the altar. Then he must pour out the rest of the blood at
the base of the altar.
31 Then he must remove all the goat’s fat, and burn all the fat on the altar, like was
done with the fat of the offering to maintain fellowship with Yahweh. And the aroma
while it burns will be pleasing to Yahweh. As a result of the priest doing that, the
person will no longer be guilty for his sin, and he will be forgiven.

1 Yahweh also said to tell the people, “If a judge orders any of you to tell in court
something that you have seen or something that you heard someone say, if you refuse
to say what you know is true, you must ◄pay a penalty/be punished► [MTY] for
refusing to tell what you know.
2 If you accidentally touch something which God considers impure [DOU], such as
the carcass of a wild animal or the carcass of a bull or cow, or of an animal that
scurries across the ground, you must ◄pay a penalty/be punished►.
3 If you touch any human feces, even if you do not intend to do that, when you
realize what you have done, you must ◄pay a penalty/be punished►.
4 If you carelessly make a solemn promise to do something that is good or that is
bad, when you realize what you have done, you must ◄pay a penalty/be punished►.
5 If you are guilty of committing any of those sins, you must confess what you have
done.
6 And for a penalty you must bring to Yahweh a female lamb or female goat, to be
an offering for the sin that you have committed, and the priest will sacrifice it, and
then you will no longer be guilty for your sin.
7 If you are poor and cannot afford to bring a lamb, you must bring to Yahweh two
doves or two young pigeons. One will be an offering for your sin and one will be an
offering that will be completely burned on the altar.
8 You must bring them to the priest. First he will offer one of them to be an offering
for your sin. He will wring/twist its neck to kill it, but he must not pull off its head
completely.
LEVITICUS 5:9
155
LEVITICUS 6:6
9 Then he must sprinkle some of the blood against the side of the altar.
The
remaining blood must be drained out at the base of the altar. That will be an offering
for your sin.
10 The priest will then do what I have commanded and offer the other bird to be
completely burned on the altar. Then you will no longer be guilty for the sin you
have committed, and Yahweh will forgive you.
11 However, if you are very poor and cannot afford two doves or two young pigeons,
you must bring to be an offering for your sin ◄2 pounds/1 kg.► of fine flour. You must
not put olive oil or incense on it, because it is an offering for sin.
12 You must take it to the priest. He will take a handful of it, to symbolize that the
whole offering truly belongs to Yahweh, and burn it on the altar, on top of the other
offerings.
13 And by doing that, the priest will enable you to no longer be guilty for any of
the sins that you have committed, and you will be forgiven. The part of the offering
that is not burned will belong to the priest, like was true for the offerings made from
grain.”
The guilt offering
15 “When you sin, without intending to, by not giving to Yahweh the things that you
are required to give to him, you must pay a penalty by bringing to Yahweh a ram that
has no defects. You must determine how much silver it is worth, by using the official
standard in the temple. It will be an offering to cause you to no longer be guilty.
16 But you must also make restitution for what you failed to give to Yahweh, adding
one-fifth of its value. You must give that to the priest. He will offer the ram as a
sacrifice for the sin that you have committed, and cause you to no longer be guilty;
and you will be forgiven.
17 If you sin by doing something that is forbidden by any of Yahweh’s commands,
even if you do not know that you have disobeyed one of my commands, you are guilty
and must pay a penalty to me.
18 When you realize what you have done, you must bring a ram to the Supreme Priest
to be an offering in order that you will no longer be guilty. You must bring one that
has no defects. He will offer the ram to be a sacrifice to me, and as a result you will
no longer be guilty for the sin that you have committed, and you will be forgiven.
19 It is an offering to cause you to no longer be guilty for sinning against me.”

1 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
2 “If any one of you you sins against me by deceiving someone—if you refuse to
return what someone has lent you, or if you steal something of his, or if you find
something and claim that you do not have it,
3 you are guilty. You must return to its owner what you have stolen or what
someone has lent you and you have not returned, or what you found that someone
else had lost,
4 or whatever you lied about.
5 You must not only return anything like that to its owner, but you must also pay to
the owner one-fifth of its value.
6 You must also bring to the Supreme Priest a ram to be an offering to me in order
that you will no longer be guilty. The ram that you bring must be one that has no
defects, one that has the value that has been officially determined.
LEVITICUS 6:7
156
LEVITICUS 6:24
7 Then he will offer that ram to be a sacrifice that will cause you to no longer be
guilty, and you will be forgiven for the wrong things that you did.”
Other instructions concerning the burnt offerings
8 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
9 “Tell this to Aaron and his sons: These are the regulations concerning the offerings
that will be completely burned on the altar: The offering must remain on the altar
all during the night, and the fire on the altar must always be kept burning.
clothes. Then he must remove the ashes of the offering from the fire and put them
11 Then he must take off those clothes and put on other clothes, and take the ashes
outside the camp, to a place that is acceptable to me.
12 The fire on the altar must always be kept burning; the priest must not allow it to
◄go out/quit burning►. Each morning the priest must put more firewood on the fire.
Then he must arrange more offerings on the fire, and burn on the altar the fat of the
offerings to be burned to maintain fellowship with me.
13 The fire on the altar must be kept burning continually; the priest must not allow
it to go out.”
Other instructions concerning the grain offerings
14 “These are the regulations concerning the offerings made from grain:
Aaron’s
sons must bring them to me in front of the altar.
15 The priest must take a handful of fine flour mixed with olive oil and incense and
burn that on the altar. That handful will signify that the whole offering truly belongs
to me. And the aroma while it burns will be pleasing to me.
16 Aaron and his sons may eat the remaining part of the grain offering. But they
must eat it in a holy place, in the courtyard of the Sacred Tent.
17 It must not have yeast mixed with it. Like the offerings for sin and the offerings
to cause people to no longer be guilty of sin, that offering is very holy.
18 Any male descendants of Aaron are permitted to eat it, because it is forever their
regular share of the offerings given to me and burned in the fire on the altar. Anyone
else who touches those offerings made from grain will be punished by God.”
19 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
20 “Tell Aaron and his sons that this is the offering that they must bring to Yahweh
on the day that any of them ◄is ordained/becomes a priest►: That person must bring
two quarts/liters of fine flour as an offering made from grain. He must bring half of
it in the morning and half of it in the evening.
21 He must mix it well with olive oil and bake it in a shallow pan. He must then
break it into small pieces to be burned on the altar. And the aroma while it burns
will be pleasing to Yahweh.
22 I have commanded that the descendants of Aaron who are appointed in turn to
become the Supreme Priests after Aaron dies are the ones who must prepare those
things. These offerings must be completely burned on the altar to be sacrifices to me,
Yahweh.
23 Every offering that a priest gives that is made from grain must be completely
burned; none of it is to be eaten.”
Other instructions concerning the sin offering
24 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
LEVITICUS 6:25
157
LEVITICUS 7:12
25 “Tell Aaron and his sons:
These are the regulations concerning the offerings
committed:
animals that are to be completely burned on the altar are slaughtered, in the
courtyard in front of the Sacred Tent.
27 Any other person who touches any of its meat will be punished by God. And if
its blood is splattered on your clothes, you must wash the clothes in a holy place.
28 If the meat is cooked in a clay pot, the pot must be broken afterwards. But if it is
cooked in a bronze pot, the pot must be scoured afterwards and rinsed with water.
29 Any male in a priest’s family may eat some of the cooked meat; that meat is very
holy.
30 But if the blood of those sin offerings is brought into the Sacred Tent to enable
the people to be forgiven for having sinned, the meat of those animals must not be
eaten. The meat must be completely burned.”
The guilt offering
7
1 “These are the regulations concerning the offerings to be made by people who are
guilty of not giving to me the things that are required to be given to me. Those are
very sacred offerings.
2 Each animal that is to be offered by such people must be slaughtered in the same
place where the animals that will be completely burned on the altar are slaughtered,
and their blood must be sprinkled against all sides of the altar.
3 All their fat, the fat tails that are cut close to the backbone, and all the fat that
covers the inner parts of the animals or which is attached to them, must be burned
on the altar.
4 That includes the kidneys with their fat near the lower back muscle, and the
protruding lobe that is attached to the liver.
5 The priest must burn them on the altar to be offerings to me, Yahweh. They are
an offering for the people to be forgiven for not doing what they were required to
do.
6 All the males in the priest’s family are permitted to eat its meat, but it must be
eaten in a sacred place, because it is very sacred.
7 “The regulation is the same for the offerings to enable people to be forgiven for
the sins they have committed and the offerings for when they are guilty of not giving
to me the things that are required to be given to me. The meat of those offerings
belongs to the priest who offers them in order that the people will be forgiven.
8 The priest who slaughters an animal that will be completely burned on the altar
is permitted to keep the animal’s hide for himself.
9 Offerings of things made from grain that are baked in an oven or cooked in a pan
or ◄in a shallow pan/on a griddle► belong to the priest who makes those offerings
for another person.
10 And offerings of things made from grain, whether they were mixed with olive
oil or not, also belong to the sons of Aaron.”
The offerings to maintain fellowship with Yahweh
11 These are the regulations concerning the offerings that people make to maintain
fellowship with Yahweh:
slaughter you must offer loaves of bread made with olive oil mixed with the flour
LEVITICUS 7:13
158
LEVITICUS 7:31
but without yeast, and wafers that are made without yeast but with olive oil smeared
on them, and loaves made from fine flour with olive oil well mixed with the flour.
13 Along with that offering to thank Yahweh, you must bring an offering of loaves
made with yeast.
14 You must bring one of each kind for an offering to Yahweh, but they belong to
the priest who sprinkles against the altar the blood of the animal that is slaughtered
as an offering to maintain fellowship with Yahweh.
15 The meat of that offering must be eaten on the day that it is offered; none of it
should be left to be eaten on the next day.
16 “However, if your offering is the result of a solemn promise that you made to
Yahweh, or if it is an offering that you make ◄voluntarily/without being required
to►, you are permitted to eat some of the meat on the day it is offered, but anything
that is left may be eaten on the next day.
17 But any meat that is left until the third day must be completely burned.
18 If any meat from the offering to maintain fellowship with Yahweh is eaten on the
third day, Yahweh will not accept that offering; it will be useless to offer it, because
Yahweh will consider that it is worthless. Anyone who eats some of it will have to
pay a penalty to Yahweh.
19 “Meat that touches something that God considers to be impure must not be eaten;
it must be completely burned. Anyone who has performed the rituals to become
acceptable to God is allowed to eat other meat which has been offered as a sacrifice.
20 But if anyone who has not performed those rituals eats some of the meat of the
offering to maintain fellowship with Yahweh, meat that belongs to Yahweh, he must
no longer be allowed to associate with God’s people.
21 If anyone touches something that God considers to be impure and very
displeasing to him, whether it is from a human or from an animal, and then he
eats any of the meat of the offering to maintain fellowship with Yahweh, meat that
belongs to Yahweh, he must no longer be allowed to associate with God’s people.”
Eating fat or blood is forbidden
22 Yahweh also said to Moses/me:
23 “Say this to the Israeli people:
‘Do not eat any of the fat of cattle or sheep or
goats.
24 The fat of an animal that is found dead or that has been killed by a wild animal
may be used for other purposes, but you must not eat it.
25 Anyone who eats the fat of an animal from which an offering has been made to
Yahweh must no longer be allowed to associate with God’s people.
26 And wherever you live, you must not eat the blood of any bird or animal.
27 If anyone eats blood, he must no longer be allowed to associate with God’s
people.’ ”
The portions for the priests
28 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
fellowship with Yahweh must bring part of it to be a sacrifice to Yahweh.
the fat along with the breast of the animal and lift it up in front of Yahweh to indicate
31 The Supreme Priest must burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron
and all his sons.
LEVITICUS 7:32
159
LEVITICUS 8:12
32 You must give to the Supreme Priest the right thigh of the animal that is sacrificed
to maintain fellowship with Yahweh.
33 The son of Aaron who offers the blood and the fat of that sacrifice must be given
the right thigh of the animal as his share.
34 From the offerings that the Israeli people give to maintain fellowship with
Yahweh, he has declared that he has given to Aaron and his sons the breast that
is lifted up and the right thigh that is offered; those portions must always be their
regular share from the Israeli people.’ ”
35 Those are the portions of the offerings brought/given to Yahweh and burned in
fire that are allotted to Aaron and his sons on the day that they are set apart to serve
Yahweh as priests.
36 Yahweh commands that on the day that the priests are appointed [MTY], the
Israeli people must always give those portions to the priests.
37 Those are the regulations for the offerings that are to be completely burned on
the altar, the offerings made from grain, the offerings to enable people to become
acceptable to God again, the offerings for when people are guilty of not giving to
Yahweh the things that are required to be given to him, the offerings given when the
priests are appointed, and the offerings to maintain fellowship with Yahweh.
38 They are regulations that Yahweh gave to Moses/me on Sinai Mountain in the
Sinai Desert, on the day that he commanded the Israeli people to start bringing their
offerings to him.
8
Aaron and his sons were appointed to be priests
1 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
2 “Bring Aaron and his sons, and bring their ◄special clothes/clothes that they will
wear while they do the work of priests►, the oil for anointing them, the bull to be
offered to cause them to become forgiven for the sins they have committed, the two
rams to be slaughtered, and the basket containing bread made without yeast.
3 Then gather all the people at the entrance to the Sacred Tent.”
4 Moses/I did what Yahweh told him/me to do, and all the people gathered there.
5 Then Moses/I said to the people, “This is what Yahweh has commanded us to do.”
6 Then he/I brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them.
7 He/I put the special tunic/shirt on Aaron, tied the sash/waistband around him,
put on him the special robe, and put on him the sacred vest/apron. He/I fastened the
sacred vest/apron around him, using the skillfully woven sash.
8 He/I put the sacred pouch on his chest and put into it the two stones for him to
use to find out what God wants.
of it the gold ornament, the object that showed that he was dedicated to God, like
10 Then Moses/I took the olive oil and anointed the sacred tent and everything in
it, and dedicated them to Yahweh.
11 He/I sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times. He/I anointed the altar
and all the things used with it, and its huge washbasin and its stand, to dedicate them
to Yahweh.
12 He/I poured some of the oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him to dedicate him
to Yahweh.
LEVITICUS 8:13
160
13 Then he/I brought forward Aaron’s sons.
LEVITICUS 8:33
He/I put tunics/shirts on them, tied
sashes/ waistbands around them, and wrapped turbans around their heads, like
Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.
14 Then he/I brought the bull for the offering to cause people to be forgiven for
the sins that have committed. Then Aaron and his sons put their hands on the bull’s
head.
15 Then Moses/I slaughtered the bull, caught some of its blood in a bowl, and with
his/my finger put some of that blood on the projections at the corners of the altar, to
purify the altar. He/I poured the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. By doing
that, he/I caused it to be a suitable place for burning sacrifices for sin.
16 Moses/I took all the fat that covers the inner parts of the animal, including the
liver and kidneys, and burned them on the altar.
17 He/I took the rest of the bull, including the hide and intestines, and burned them
outside the camp, like Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.
18 Then he/I brought the ram for the offering that would be completely burned on
the altar, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
19 Then Moses/I slaughtered the ram and sprinkled its blood on all sides of the altar.
20-21 He/I cut the ram into pieces and washed the inner parts and hind legs.Then
he/I put the head, the fat, and the other parts of the ram on the altar. As it burned,
the aroma of the smoke was pleasing to Yahweh. It was an offering to Yahweh that
was burned, as Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.
22 Then he/I brought the other ram, the one for consecrating the priests, and Aaron
and his sons laid their hands on its head.
23-24 Moses/I slaughtered that ram, drained some of its blood in a bowl, and put some
of that blood on the lobes of the right ears, the thumbs of the right hands, and the
big toes of the right feet of Aaron and his sons to indicate that what they listened to
and what they did and where they went should be directed by Yahweh.
25 He/I picked up all the fat of the ram, its fat tail, the fat that covered the inner
parts, including the fat that covered the liver and kidneys, and the right thigh of the
ram.
26-27 Then from the basket containing the bread that was made without yeast, the
bread which had been dedicated to Yahweh, he/I picked up one loaf of bread made
without olive oil, and one loaf that was made by mixing the flour with olive oil, and
Aaron and his sons. Then they lifted them up in the presence of Yahweh to indicate
28 Then Moses/I took those things from their hands and burned them on the altar.
the aroma while it burned was pleasing to Yahweh.
29 Moses/I also took the breast of the second ram and lifted it up, as Yahweh had
commanded. The breast was Moses’/my share of the ram that was sacrificed to
dedicate the priests.
30 Then Moses/I took some of the olive oil for anointing Aaron and his sons, and
some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his sons and
on their clothes. By doing that, he/I consecrated Aaron and his sons and their clothes.
31 Then Moses/I said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the meat of the second ram at the
entrance of the Sacred Tent, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket, like
I told you to do.
32 Burn up any of the meat and bread that remains.
33 The time for you to be set apart as priests will be seven days, so do not leave the
entrance of the Sacred Tent for seven days.
LEVITICUS 8:34
161
LEVITICUS 9:16
34 What we have done today is what Yahweh commanded to cause that you will be
forgiven for your sins.
35 You must stay at the entrance of the Sacred Tent for seven days and seven nights
and do what Yahweh requires, in order that you will not die because of disobeying
him. I am telling you that because that is what Yahweh has commanded me to tell
you.”
36 So Aaron and his sons did everything that Yahweh told Moses/me to tell them.
9
Aaron and his sons started to offer sacrifices
1 Eight days later, Moses/I summoned the elders of Israel.
2 Then he/I said to Aaron, “Take a young bull for the offering to enable you leaders
to be forgiven for the sins you have committed, and a ram to be completely burned
on the altar, both of them without any defects, and offer them to Yahweh.
3 Then say to the Israeli people, ‘Take one male goat for the offering to enable you
all to be forgiven for the sins you have committed. Also take a calf and a lamb that
have no defects, to be an offering completely burned on the altar.
4 Also take an ox and a ram to be an offering to maintain fellowship with Yahweh,
along with an offering of flour mixed with olive oil. Do this because today Yahweh is
going to appear to you.’ ”
5 After Moses/I told this to the Israeli people, some of them took the things that Moses/
I had commanded them to take, and went to the courtyard in front of the Sacred Tent.
Then all the people came near and stood in front of Yahweh.
6 Then Moses/I said, “This is what Yahweh has commanded you to do, in order that
his glory will appear to you.”
7 Then Moses/I said to Aaron, “Come to the altar and sacrifice the animal that is
animal that will be completely burned there. Because of those offerings, God will
things that Yahweh has commanded.”
sins.
9 His sons brought its blood to him in a bowl. He dipped his finger into the blood
and put some of it on the projections at the corners of the altar. He poured out the
rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
10 He/I burned the fat, including that which covered the kidneys and the liver, as
Yahweh had commanded him/me.
11 Then Aaron burned the rest of the meat and the hide/skin outside the camp.
12 Then Aaron slaughtered the animal that would be completely burned on the altar.
His sons handed him the bowl containing its blood, and he sprinkled the blood on all
sides of the altar.
13 Then they handed him the head and the pieces of the animal that would be
burned, and he burned them on the altar.
14 He washed the inner parts and the legs of the animal, and burned them on the
altar, on top of the other pieces of the animal.
15 Then Aaron brought the animals that would be sacrifices for the Israeli people.
He took the goat and slaughtered it to be an offering to enable them to be forgiven
for the sins they had committed, like he had done with the goat for his own offering.
16 Then he brought the animal for the offering to be completely burned. He
slaughtered it and offered it in the way that Yahweh had commanded him to do.
LEVITICUS 9:17
162
LEVITICUS 10:7
17 He also brought the offering of grain.
He took a handful of it and burned it on
the altar, like he had done for the animal that he had slaughtered and completely
burned on the altar in the morning.
18 Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, to be an offering for the Israeli people
to maintain fellowship with Yahweh. His sons handed him the bowl containing the
blood, and he sprinkled the blood against all sides of the altar.
19 But he took the fat from the ox and the ram, including their fat tails that were
cut close to the backbone, and all the fat that covered the livers and the kidneys.
20 He put them on top of the breasts of those animals and carried them to the altar
to be burned.
21 Then, doing what Moses/I had commanded, he lifted up in front of Yahweh
the breast and the right thigh of those animals, to signify that those two animals
completely belonged to Yahweh.
22 Then Aaron lifted his arms toward the people and asked Yahweh to bless them.
Then having finished making all those offerings, he stepped down from the place
where the altar was.
23 Then Aaron and Moses/I entered the Sacred Tent. When they/we later came
out, they/we asked Yahweh to bless the people. And suddenly the glory/brightness of
Yahweh appeared to all the people.
24 A fire from Yahweh appeared and burned up the offering that was to be
completely burned and the fat that was on the altar. And when all the people saw that,
they shouted joyfully and prostrated themselves on the ground to worship Yahweh.
10
1 Two of Aaron’s sons,
Nadab and Abihu, took the pans in which they burned
incense. They put some burning coals in them and put incense on top of the coals,
but this fire was not acceptable to Yahweh because it was not the kind that he had
commanded them to burn.
2 So suddenly a fire from Yahweh appeared and burned them up [DOU] in the
presence of Yahweh.
3 Then Moses/I said to Aaron, “That is what Yahweh predicted. He said,
‘Those priests who come near to me,
I will show them that they must ◄respect me/treat me as being holy►;
in the presence of all the people
I am the one who must be honored.’ ”
But Aaron said nothing.
4 Then Moses/I summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, who were the sons of Aaron’s
uncle Uzziel, and said to them, “Take the corpses of your cousins outside the camp,
away from the front of the Sacred Tent.”
5 So they carried the corpses, which still had their special gowns on, outside the
camp, and buried them.
6 Then Moses/I said to Aaron and his other two sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “You are
sad because Nadab and Abihu died, but you must act like you always do. Do not allow
the hair on your heads to remain uncombed, and do not tear your clothes. But your
relatives and all your fellow Israelis are allowed to mourn for those whom Yahweh
destroyed by fire.
7 But you must not leave the entrance of the Sacred Tent to join those who are
mourning, because if you do that, you also will die, and Yahweh will punish [MTY] all
the people of Israel. Do not forget that Yahweh has set you apart [MTY] to work for
LEVITICUS 10:8
163
LEVITICUS 11:4
him here, and he does not want you to become defiled by touching a corpse.” So they
did what Moses/I told them to do.
8 Then Yahweh said to Aaron,
9 “You and your two sons who are still alive must not drink wine or other fermented
drinks before you enter the Sacred Tent; if you do that, you will die. That is a
command that you and your descendants must obey forever.
10 You must do that in order to learn what things are holy and what things are ◄not
holy/common►, and from the things that are not holy you must learn what things are
acceptable to me and what things are not.
11 And you must teach to the Israeli people all the laws that I gave to the Israeli
people by telling them to Moses.”
12 Moses/I said to Aaron and his two sons who were still alive, Eleazar and Ithamar,
“Take the offering made from grain that is left after a portion of it has been offered to
Yahweh to be burned, and eat it alongside the altar. It should not be eaten elsewhere,
because it is very holy.
13 Eat it in a holy place; it is the share for you and your sons from the offerings that
14 But you and your sons and daughters are permitted to eat the breast and the
acceptable to him►. They have been given to you and your descendants as your
share of the offerings to enable the Israelis to maintain fellowship with Yahweh.
15 The thigh and the breast that were lifted up in front of Yahweh must be brought
with the portions of fat to be burned, to be lifted up in his presence. They will be the
regular share for you and your descendants, as Yahweh has commanded.”
16 When Moses/I inquired about the goat that had been sacrificed to enable the
people to be forgiven by Yahweh for the sins they had committed, he/I found out
that it had been completely burned. So he/I was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar and
asked them,
17 “Why did you not eat near the Sacred Tent the meat of the offering for sin? It
was very holy, and it was given to you to enable the Israeli people to no longer be
guilty for their sins and to be forgiven for their sins.
18 Since its blood was not taken into the holy place inside the Sacred Tent, you
should have eaten the meat of the goat near the Sacred Tent, as I commanded.”
19 Aaron replied to Moses/me, “Today the people brought to Yahweh their offering to
be forgiven for the sins they had committed, and the offering to be completely burned,
and surely that pleased Yahweh, but think about the terrible thing that happened to
my other two sons! Would [RHQ] Yahweh have been pleased if I had eaten some of
the offering to cause the people to become acceptable to God?”
Food that is acceptable to God and food that is not
1 Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses/me,
2 “Tell the Israeli people that this is what Yahweh says: From all the animals that
live on the land, these are the ones that you are permitted to eat:
3 The ones that have hooves that are completely split and that ◄chew their cuds/
bring their food up from their stomachs to chew it again►.
4 There are some animals that chew their cuds but do not have split hooves, and
some animals that have split hooves but do not chew their cuds. You must not eat any
LEVITICUS 11:5
164
LEVITICUS 11:30
of those animals. For example, camels chew their cuds but do not have split hooves,
so they are unacceptable for you to eat.
5 Rock badgers chew their cuds but do not have split hooves, so they are
unacceptable for you to eat.
6 Rabbits chew their cuds but do not have split hooves, so they are unacceptable
for you to eat.
7 Pigs have completely split hooves but they do not chew their cuds, so they are
unacceptable for you to eat.
8 All of those animals are unacceptable for you, so you must not eat their meat or
even touch their carcasses.
9 From all the creatures that live in the oceans and the streams, you are permitted
to eat any that have fins and scales.
10 But you must detest and not eat those that do not have fins and scales. That
includes ones that are very small.
11 You must despise them, and you must not eat their meat, and you must detest
their carcasses.
12 You must detest everything that lives in the water that does not have fins and
scales.
13 There are some birds that you must detest and not eat. They include eagles,
bearded vultures, black vultures,
14 kites, any kind of falcon/buzzard,
15 any kind of raven,
16 horned owls, screech owls, seagulls, any kind of hawk,
17 small owls, cormorants, large owls,
18 white owls, desert owls, vultures that eat dead animals,
19 storks, any kind of heron, hoopoes, and bats.
[MTY].
21 But you are permitted to eat creatures with wings that sometimes walk on the
ground if they have jointed legs for hopping around.
22 They include locusts, crickets, and grasshoppers.
23 But you must detest and not eat other insects with wings that have four legs.
24 ‘There are certain creatures that if you touch their carcasses you will become
defiled. Anyone who touches their carcasses must not touch other people until that
evening.
25 Anyone who picks up one of their carcasses must wash his clothes and not touch
other people until that evening.
26 ‘The animals whose carcasses you must not touch are those that have hooves
that are not completely divided or animals that do not chew their cuds. Anyone who
touches the carcasses of any of those animals becomes ◄defiled/unacceptable to me►.
27 From all the animals that walk on the ground, you must not touch the carcasses
of those that have paws to walk on. Anyone who touches one of their carcasses must
not touch other people until that evening.
28 Anyone who picks up one of their carcasses must wash his clothes and not touch
other people until that evening, because touching their carcasses ◄defiles you/causes
you to become unacceptable to me►.
29 ‘From all the animals that walk on the ground, these are the ones that ◄defile
you/cause you to become unacceptable to me► if you touch them: Moles, rats, any

31 Those creatures that scurry across the ground ◄defile you/cause you to become
unacceptable to me►; anyone who touches one of their carcasses must not touch
other people until the evening.
32 When one of those creatures dies and falls on something, the thing that it falls
on, whatever it is used for, will become ◄defiled/unacceptable to me►, whether it is
made of wood or cloth or the hide of some animal or from rough cloth. You must put
it in water. Then you must not use it until that evening.
33 If one of them falls into a clay pot, everything in it becomes defiled, and you must

it again.
36 If one of their carcasses falls into a spring or a pit for storing water, the water may
still be drunk, but anyone who touches one of those carcasses becomes unacceptable
to me.
37 If one of those carcasses falls on seeds that are to be planted, those seeds are still
acceptable to be planted.
38 But if water has been put on the seeds and then a carcass falls on them, the seeds
must be thrown away.
39 ‘If an animal whose meat you are permitted to eat dies, anyone who touches its
carcass must not touch other people until that evening.
40 Anyone who eats some meat from that carcass must wash his clothes, and then
he must not touch anyone until that evening.
41-42 ‘All creatures that scurry across the ground, including those that move on their
bellies and those that crawl, are detestable, and they must not be eaten.
43 Do not ◄defile yourselves/cause you to become unacceptable to me► by eating
any of those creatures [DOU].
44 I am Yahweh your God, and I am holy, so you must consecrate yourselves and
be holy. You must avoid eating things that cause you to be unacceptable to me. Do
not cause yourselves to become unacceptable to me by eating creatures that scurry
across the ground.
45 I am Yahweh, the one who freed you from being slaves in Egypt, in order to be
your God. Therefore, because I am holy, you must be holy.
46 'Those are the regulations concerning animals and birds, all the living creatures
that live in water or scurry across the ground.

and learn what things you are permitted to eat and what things you are not permitted
to eat.’ ”

Purifying women after they give birth
1 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
2 “Tell this to the Israeli people:
‘If a woman gives birth to a son, she must be
avoided for seven days, like she must be avoided when she is menstruating each
month.
3 The baby son must be circumcised on the eighth day after he is born.
LEVITICUS 12:4
166
LEVITICUS 13:10
4 Then the woman must wait 33 days to be purified from her bleeding during
childbirth. She must not touch anything that is sacred or enter the Sacred Tent area
5 If a woman gives birth to a daughter, she must be avoided for two weeks, like she
to be purified from the bleeding that occurred when her baby was born.
6 ‘Then that time for her to be purified is ended, that woman must bring to the priest
at the entrance of the Sacred Tent a one-year-old lamb to be completely burned on
the altar, and a dove or a young pigeon to be sacrificed to enable her to become
acceptable to Yahweh again.
7 The priest will offer them to Yahweh in order that she may be forgiven for any
sins she has committed. Then she will be purified from her loss of blood when the
baby was born.
‘Those are the regulations for women who give birth to a son or daughter.
8 If a woman who gives birth to a child cannot afford a lamb, she must bring two
doves or two young pigeons. One will be burned completely on the altar, and one
will be an offering to enable her to become acceptable to God again. By doing that,
the priest will cause that she will be forgiven for any sins she has committed, and
she no longer will need to be avoided.’ ”

Regulations concerning contagious skin diseases
1 Yahweh said this to Aaron and Moses/me:
2 “When someone has on his skin a swelling or a rash or a shiny/bright spot that
may become ◄contagious/a dreaded skin disease►, he must be brought to Aaron or
to one of his sons who are also priests.
3 The priest must examine that part of the person’s skin. If the hair in that area
has become white and it appears that the sore is deeper than just on the skin, it is a
contagious skin disease. When the priest sees that, he must declare that the person
must stay away from other people [MTY].
4 If the spot on the person’s skin is white but it does not appear that the sore is
deeper than just on the skin, the priest must tell him to stay away from other people
for seven days.
5 Then the priest must examine the person again. If the priest sees that the sore has
not changed and has not spread, he must tell the person to stay away from people
for seven more days.
6 Then the priest must examine him again. If the sore has faded and has not spread,
the priest will allow him to be with other people again; it is only a rash. After the
person washes his clothes, he will be allowed to be with other people again.
7 But if the sore spreads after the priest has examined him, he must go to the priest
again.
8 The priest will examine him; and if the sore has spread to more of the skin, it is
a contagious skin disease, and the priest will declare that he must stay away from
other people.
9 When anyone has a contagious skin disease, he must be brought to the priest.
10 The priest must examine him. And if there is a white swelling in the skin that
has caused the hair in that swelling to become white, and if the flesh in that area is
painful/sensitive,
LEVITICUS 13:11
167
from other people. The priest does not need to tell that person that he must avoid
other people, because other people already are wanting to stay away from him.
12 ‘If the disease spreads all over someone’s body, and the priest examines that
person and sees that it is covering his skin from his head to his feet,
13 and it has caused all his skin to become white which will indicate that the disease
has ended, the priest will declare that the person does not have to stay away from
other people.
14 But if the person has open sores and they are very painful/sensitive, he has a
contagious skin disease,
15 and when the priest sees that, he will declare that the person must stay away
from other people.

priest will declare that the person who had been infected is now permitted to be
with other people again.
18 ‘Then someone has a boil on his skin and it has healed,
19 but in the place where the boil was a white swelling or a bright/shiny spot
appears, he must go to the priest.
20 The priest must examine it. And if it seems to be deeper than just on the skin,
and if the hair in that spot has become white, it is a contagious skin disease that has
appeared where the boil had been. And the priest will declare that the person must
stay away from other people.
21 But when the priest examines it, if there is no white hair in that spot and it is
only on the surface of the skin and has become less bright/shiny, then the priest will
order him to stay away from other people for seven days.
22 But if it is spreading, it is contagious and the priest will declare that the person
must stay away from other people.
23 But if that spot is unchanged and has not spread, it is only a scar from the boil,
and the priest will declare that the person is permitted to be with other people again.
24 ‘Then someone has a burn on his skin and a bright/shiny or white spot appears,
and the flesh in that area is sensitive/painful,
25 the priest must examine the spot. If the hair in that spot has turned white and it
seems to be deeper than just on the surface of the skin, it is a contagious skin disease
that has appeared where the burn was, and that person must stay away from other
people.
26 But when the priest examines it and sees that there is no white hair in that spot
and it is only on the surface of the skin, and has faded, the priest will declare that
the person must stay away from people for seven days.
27 On the seventh day, the priest will examine him again. If the sore is spreading,
it is a contagious skin disease, and the priest will declare that the person must stay
away from other people.
28 However, if the spot is not changed and has not spread but has faded, it is only
a scar from the burn, and the priest will declare that the person is permitted to be
with other people again.
29 ‘If a man or a woman has a sore on his head or on his chin,
30 the priest must examine it. If it appears to be deeper than just on the surface
of the skin, and the hair in that spot has thinned out and has become yellowish, it

is a contagious skin disease that causes itching. And the priest will declare that the
person must stay away from other people.
31 But when the priest examines that kind of sore, if it seems to be only on the
surface of the skin and there is no healthy hair in it, the priest will tell the person to
stay away from other people for seven days.
32 On the seventh day, the priest will examine the sore again. If it has not spread
and if there is no yellow hair in that spot and if it appears to be only on the surface
of the skin,
33 the person must shave the hair near the sore but not the hair on the sore. And
the priest will tell him to stay away from other people for seven more days.
34 On the seventh day, the priest will examine that spot again. If it has not spread
and it appears to be only on the surface of the skin, the priest will declare that the
person is permitted to be with people again. The person must wash his clothes, and
then he can be with other people.
35 But if the sore later spreads,
36 the priest must examine him again. If the itch/sore has spread, the priest does
not need to look for yellow hair, because it is clear that the person has a contagious
skin disease.
37 However, if the priest thinks that the spot has not changed, and healthy hair is
growing in that area, it is clear that the itch has healed, and the priest will declare
that the person is permitted to be with other people again.
38 ‘Then a man or a woman has white spots on the skin,
39 the priest should examine them. But if the spots are dull white, it is only a rash,
and the priest will declare that the person is permitted to be with other people.
40-41 ‘If a man loses the hair on any part of his head, he does not need to stay away
from other people.
42 But if he gets a bright/shiny sore on his bald head or on his forehead, he has a
contagious skin disease.
43 The priest must examine him. If the swollen sore is a bright spot like the spot on
someone who has a contagious skin disease,
44 the priest will declare that the man has a contagious skin disease and must not
be with other people.
45 ‘Anyone who has a contagious skin disease must wear torn clothes and not comb
his hair. When he is near other people, he must cover the lower part to his face and
call out, “Do not come near me! I have a contagious skin disease!”
46 He is not allowed to be with other people as long as he has the disease. He must
live alone, outside the camp.’ ”
Regulations concerning mildew
47-48 “Sometimes a person’s clothing gets mildew on it.
It may be clothing that is
woven from wool or made from linen or from leather.
49 If the contaminated/ mildewed part is greenish or reddish, it is a spreading
mildew, and it must be shown to the priest.
50 The priest will examine it, and then put it in a separate place by itself for seven
days.
51 On the seventh day he must examine it again. If the mildew has spread, it is
clear that it is a type of mildew that destroys clothing, and that clothing must not be
worn again.
52 The owner must burn completely the item that has the mildew in it, whatever
kind of item it is.
54 he will tell the person who owns it to wash it. Then he must put it in a separate
place for another seven days.
55 Then the priest will examine it again. If the color of the mildew has not changed,
even though it has not spread, that item must not be worn again. It does not matter
if the mildew is on the inside of the clothing or on the outside; it must be burned.
56 But when the priest examines it after it has been washed, if the mildew has faded,
he must tear out that part that had the mildew in it.
57 But if the mildew reappears in that item, it is clear that it is spreading, and the
whole item must be burned.
58 But after the clothing is washed and the mildew disappears, it must be washed
again, and then it can be worn again.
59 Those are the regulations concerning mildew on things made of wool or linen or
leather, for deciding whether those things can continue to be worn or not.”
14
Rituals for those healed of contagious skin diseases
1 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
2 “These are the regulations for anyone who has been healed of a contagious skin
disease.
3 The person must be brought to a priest. The priest will take him outside the camp
to where that person has been staying, and examine him. If the skin disease has been
healed,
4 the priest will say that someone must bring two living birds that are acceptable
to Yahweh, along with some cedar wood, some scarlet/red yarn, and some sprigs of
◄hyssop/a very leafy plant►.
5 Then the priest will command that one of the birds be killed while it is being held
over a clay pot containing water from a spring.
6 Then the priest will dip the other bird, along with the cedar wood, the scarlet/red
yarn and the hyssop, into the blood of the bird that was killed.
7 Then he must sprinkle some of the blood on the person who was healed; he must
sprinkle it on him seven times. Then he will declare that the person is permitted to
be with other people again. And the priest will release the other bird and allow it to
fly away.
8 “Then the person who was healed must wash his clothes, shave off all his hair,
and bathe. Then he is allowed to return to the camp, but he must stay outside his
tent for seven days.
9 On the seventh day, he must again shave off all his hair, including his beard and
his eyebrows. Then he must again wash his clothes and bathe, and then he will be
allowed to be with other people again.
10 “The next day that person must bring two male lambs and one female lamb that
is one year old, all of them with no defects. He must also bring six quarts/liters of
fine flour, mixed with olive oil, to be an offering, and ◄0.6 pint/0.3 liter► of olive oil.
11 The priest who declares that the person’s skin disease is ended must bring that
person, and his offerings, to me, Yahweh, at the entrance of the Sacred Tent.
12 “Then the priest must take one of the male lambs and lift it up, along with the
olive oil, in front of me, to be a guilt offering—an offering for his being guilty for not
giving to me the things that he was required to give me.
13 Then the priest must slaughter the lamb in the sacred place where the other
sacrifices are offered. Like the offering to enable people to be forgiven, this guilt
offering is holy, and belongs to the priest.
LEVITICUS 14:14
170
LEVITICUS 14:32
14 The priest must take some of the blood of that animal and pour it on the lobe/tip
of the right ear and on the thumb of the right hand and on the big toe of the right
foot of the one who has been healed of the skin disease.
15 Then the priest must take some of the olive oil and pour it in the palm of his own
left hand.
16 Then he must dip the forefinger of his right hand into the oil in his palm, and
sprinkle it in front of me seven times.
17 Then he must put some of the oil that is still in the palm of his hand on the lobe/
tip of the right ear and the thumb of the right hand and on the big toe of the right
foot of the person who has been healed of the skin disease. He must put it on top of
the blood that he has already put on those places.
18 The remaining oil in his palm must be put on the person’s head, to indicate that
I declare that the person has been forgiven for having sinned.
19 “Then the priest must slaughter one of the other two animals, to show that the
one who has been healed of the skin disease has been forgiven for having sinned, and
that he has become acceptable to Yahweh. Then the priest will slaughter the animal
that will be completely burned on the altar.
20 He will also put on the altar the offering of grain, to indicate that the person has
been forgiven for having sinned. Then that person will be allowed to be with other
people again.
21 “But if the person who has been healed of a skin disease is poor and cannot
afford to bring all those animals, he must take to the priest one male lamb to be lifted
up to be an offering for his not giving to me the things that he was required to give
offering made from grain, ◄0.6 pint/0.3 liter► of olive oil,
has committed, and one to be completely burned on the altar.
of the Sacred Tent, to offer them to Yahweh.
24 The priest will take the lamb for the offering for that person not giving to me the
things that he was required to give me, along with the olive oil, and lift them up in
front of me.
25 Then the priest will slaughter that lamb and drain some of the blood in a bowl,
and take some of that blood and put it on the lobe/tip of the person’s right ear and
on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
26 Then the priest will pour some of the oil into the palm of his left hand,
27 and with his right forefinger he must sprinkle some of the oil from his palm there
in my presence.
28 He must put some of the oil in his palm on the same places where he put the
blood.
29 He must put the rest of the oil that is in his hand on the head of the person who
has been healed of a skin disease, to indicate that I have forgiven him for having
sinned.
30 Then the priest must sacrifice the doves or the pigeons, whichever that person
has brought.
31 One will be an offering for sin and the other will be completely burned on the
altar, along with the offering of grain. By doing that, the priest will declare that the
person is no longer guilty for having sinned.
32 “Those are the regulations for anyone who has a contagious skin disease and
who is poor and cannot afford the usual offerings, in order that he can be with people
again.”

LEVITICUS 14:56
Instructions regarding mildew in a house
33 Yahweh also said to Aaron and Moses/me,
34 “I am about to give you Canaan land to belong to your people permanently. When
you enter that land, there will be times when I cause/allow mildew to appear inside
one of your houses.
35 If that happens, the owner of that house must go to the priest and tell him, ‘There
is something in my house that looks like mildew.’
36 “Then the priest will say to him, ‘Take everything out of the house before I enter
the house to examine the mildew. If you do not do that, I will declare that everything
in the house is contaminated.’
37 After the owner takes everything outside of his house, the priest will go in and
inspect the house. If the mildew has caused greenish or reddish spots/depressions on
the walls that seem to be deeper than only on the surface of the walls,
38 the priest will go outside the house and lock it up for seven days.
39 On the seventh day, he must go into the house and inspect it again. If the mildew
on the walls has spread,
40 the priest will tell someone to tear out and throw in the dump outside the town
all the stones in the walls that have mildew on them.

on them, and take new clay and plaster to cover the stones in the walls of the house.
44 the priest must go and examine the house again. If the mildew has spread inside
the house, it will be clear that the mildew is the kind that destroys houses, and no
one will be allowed to live in it.
45 It must be completely torn down—the stones, the timber and the plaster—and
all those things must be thrown into a dump outside the town.
46 “Anyone who goes into that house while it is locked up will not be allowed to be
with other people until sunset of that day.
47 Anyone who sleeps in that house or eats in that house during that time must wash
his clothes.
48 “But when the priest comes to examine the house after it has been plastered, if
the mildew has not spread, he shall declare that people may live in it, because the
mildew is gone.
49 But before people are allowed to live in it, the priest must take two small birds
and some cedar wood and some red/scarlet yarn and some hyssop.
50 He must kill one of the birds while holding it over a clay pot containing water
from a spring.
51 Then he must take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the red/scarlet yarn, and the
other/living bird, and dip them into the blood of the dead bird, and sprinkle some of
that blood on the house seven times.
52 By doing all those things he will cause the house to be acceptable to be lived in
again.
53 Then he must release the other bird and allow it to fly away. By doing that, he
will finish the ritual for causing the house to be acceptable for people to live in it
again.
54 “Those are the regulations for contagious diseases, for itching sores,
55 for mildew [DOU] on clothes or in a house,
56 and for swellings, rashes, or bright spots on sores,

will still be permitted to touch their clothing or their house, or not.”

Discharges from bodies
1 Yahweh also said to Moses/me and Aaron,
2 “Tell this to the Israelis: When an infected discharge comes out of a man’s sexual
organs [EUP], that fluid should not be touched.
3 Whether that fluid is blocked or continues to drip, it causes him to be someone
who should not be touched.
4 “And any bed that such a man lies on should not be touched, and anything that
he sits on should not be touched.
one should touch him until that evening.
bathe, and no one should touch him until that evening.
7 “Anyone who touches such a man must wash his clothes and bathe, and no one
should touch him until that evening.
8 “If such a man spits on someone else, that person who is spit upon should not be
touched. He must wash his clothes, and no one should touch him until that evening.
9 “Everything that a man who has such a discharge of fluid sits on while he is riding
a horse or a donkey should not be touched,
10 and anyone who touches the seat or saddle that he was sitting on also should
not be touched until that evening. And anyone who picks up the seat or saddle must
wash his clothes and bathe, and no one should touch him until that evening.
11 Anyone whom the man with such a discharge of fluid from his body touches
without first rinsing his hands in water must wash his clothes and bathe, and no one
should touch him until that evening.
12 “If such a man touches a clay pot, that pot must be broken into pieces. Anything
made from wood that he touches must be rinsed in water.
13 “If such a man is healed from his flow of fluid, he must wait for seven days. Then
he must wash his clothes and bathe in water from a spring. Then he will be able to
be with others.
14 On the eighth/next day, he must take two doves or two young pigeons and come
in front of Yahweh at the entrance of the Sacred Tent, and give them to the priest.
15 The priest will sacrifice them. One will be an offering for the man to become

result of the priest doing that, the man will be forgiven for having sinned.

The Day of Atonement
1 After the two sons of Aaron died because they burned incense to Yahweh in a
manner that was contrary to what Yahweh commanded, Yahweh spoke to Moses/me.
2 He said to him/me, “Warn your older brother Aaron that he must not enter the
Very Holy Place inside the curtain that is in the Sacred Tent whenever he wants to,
because the cover of the sacred chest is there. That is the place where the priest
◄makes atonement for/requests me to forgive► sins. I am present in the cloud that
is over the cover of the sacred chest. If Aaron goes in that room when it is not the
proper time, he will die!
3 “When Aaron enters the Sacred Tent area, he must bring a bull that will be killed
to become an offering/sacrifice for sins, and a ram to be killed to be an offering that
will be completely burned on the altar.
4 Then he must bathe his whole body, and put on the linen underwear/undershorts
and the linen gown. He must tie the linen sash/waistbands around his waist and
wrap the turban around his head. Those are his sacred garments.
5 The Israeli people must then bring to him two male goats to be killed as an offering/
sacrifice for sin, and a ram to be killed and burned completely on the altar.
6 “Aaron must offer the bull to me to be a sacrifice in order that ◄I will forgive his
sins and the sins of his family/his sins and the sins of his family will be forgiven►.
7 Then he must bring the two male goats to me at the entrance to the Sacred Tent.
LEVITICUS 16:8

8 He must ◄cast lots/throw down stones that have been marked► to determine
which goat will be sacrificed to me, and which will be the goat that will be set free.

11 “Then Aaron must bring the young bull to me, to be an offering/sacrifice for
himself and for his family. He must slaughter that bull to be an offering for their
sins, and he must drain the blood into a basin.
12 Then he must take some burning coals from the bronze altar and put them in
the incense burner. Then he must fill his hands with fragrant finely-ground incense.
Then he must take the incense and the incense burner inside the curtain into the
Very Holy Place of the Sacred Tent.
13 There he must put the incense on the burning coals, with the result that a cloud
of burning incense will rise up over the lid of the sacred chest. If he obeys these
instructions, he will not die like Korah’s two sons did because of offering incense
incorrectly (OR, because of being in God’s presence).
14 Then he must dip his finger into the basin and sprinkle some blood on the lid of
the sacred chest, and also sprinkle some blood seven times against the front of the
chest.
offering for the sins of the people. Then he must bring its blood into the Very Holy
sacred chest and against the front of the chest, like he did with the bull’s blood.
of the blood on the Sacred Tent, because the tent is in the midst of the camp of the
Israeli people who have become unacceptable to me because of their sins.
17 When Aaron goes into the Very Holy Place in the Sacred Tent to purify it, no
one else is permitted to enter the other part of the Sacred Tent. Only after Aaron
has performed rituals to enable me to forgive him and his family, and all the Israeli
people, is any priest permitted to enter the Sacred Tent.
18 “Then Aaron must go outside the tent to purify my altar. He must do this by
smearing some of the blood from the bull and some of the blood from the goat on
each of the projections at the corners of the altar.
19 Then Aaron must dip his finger into the basin of blood and sprinkle some of the
blood over the altar seven times. By doing that, he will cleanse it from being unholy
because of the sins of the Israeli people, and it will become holy again.
20 “When Aaron has finished purifying the Very Holy Place inside the Sacred Tent
and all of the Sacred Tent and the altar, he must bring the goat that was chosen to be
set free.
21 He must put both of his hands on the head of the goat and confess all the sins
[DOU] of the Israeli people. By doing that, he will put the guilt of their sins on the
head of the goat. Then he must give the goat to a man who is chosen, and that man
22 It is as though the goat will carry away into the desert the guilt for the sins of all
the people.
23 “When Aaron approaches the Sacred Tent, he must take off the linen clothes that
he wore when he previously entered the Very Holy Place, and he must leave those
clothes there.
LEVITICUS 16:24
175
LEVITICUS 17:6
24 Then he must bathe in a sacred place, put on his regular/ordinary clothes, and
sacrifice the animals that will be burned completely on the altar for his own sins and
for the sins of the Israeli people. By doing that he will enable me to forgive him and
them.
25 He must also burn on the altar all the fat of the bull and the goat that were
sacrificed.
26 “The man who was chosen to send the other goat into the desert and free it there
must afterwards wash his clothes and bathe. Then he may return to the camp.
27 The carcasses of the bull and the goat that were slaughtered to be an offering/
sacrifice for the people’s sins, whose blood was taken inside the Very Holy Place to
enable Yahweh to forgive the Israeli people, must be carried outside the camp and
burned. The hides/skins of the animals, the inner organs, and the dung must also be
burned.
28 The man who burns those things must then wash his clothes and bathe before
he returns to the camp.
29 “On ◄October/the month after the dry season ends►, on the day that I have
appointed, you all must ◄fast/abstain from eating food► and not do any work. This
is a rule/law that will never end. It must be obeyed by you people who have been
Israelis all your lives, and also by foreigners who are living among you.
30 On that day, Aaron will perform rituals to enable me to forgive you all, and then I
will cleanse/free you all from the guilt of all your sins and you will become acceptable
to me.
31 That will be a day for you to rest and not do any work, like the Sabbath days, and
you must ◄fast/abstain from eating food► all that day. That is a permanent command/
law for you all to obey.
32 In future years, after Aaron has died, this ritual/ceremony to enable me to forgive
you all [DOU] will be performed by the Supreme Priest who is anointed with olive oil
and appointed to serve instead of his ancestor Aaron. He must put on the sacred
clothes made of linen
33 and offer sacrifices to purify the Very Holy Place, all of the Sacred Tent, the altar,
the priests, and all the Israel people like Aaron did.
34 This will be a permanent command/law for you to obey once every year, to enable
me to forgive you Israeli people for the sins that you have committed.”
Moses/I obeyed all those instructions/commands that Yahweh had given to him/me.
17
Where sacrifices are to be offered
2 “Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the other Israeli people, and say this to
them: ‘This is what Yahweh has commanded:
3 If you sacrifice an ox or a lamb or a goat, you must bring it to the priest at the
entrance of the Sacred Tent area, to present/offer it to me there.
4 If you slaughter it to be a sacrifice anywhere else in the camp or outside the camp,
you will be guilty of killing an animal in an unacceptable place. As a result you will
no longer be allowed to be/associate with my people.
5 That rule is in order that you Israeli people, instead of offering sacrifices in the
open fields, will offer them to me by taking them to the priest at the entrance of the
Sacred Tent area, to be offerings to maintain fellowship with me.
6 After the animal is slaughtered, the priest must sprinkle some of its blood against
the altar at the entrance of the Sacred Tent, and burn its fat to be an aroma that is
pleasing to me.
LEVITICUS 17:7
176
LEVITICUS 18:13
7 You people must no longer give sacrifices to the demons that resemble goats which
you are worshiping. You people must obey this command forever.’
8 “And tell this to the people: ‘If any Israeli or any foreigner who is living among
them brings an offering that is to be completely burned on the altar, or any other
sacrifice,
9 and does not bring it to the entrance of the Sacred Tent area to be a sacrifice to
me, that person will no longer be allowed to associate with my people.
10 ‘I will reject [IDM] any Israeli or any foreigner who is living among you who eats
any blood, and I will command that he no longer be allowed to associate with my
people.
11 That is because the life of every creature is in its blood; I have declared that it is
blood that is to be offered on the altar to enable people to be forgiven for their sins.
12 That is why I say that you Israelis must not eat blood, and the foreigners who
live among you must also not eat blood.
13 ‘Any Israeli or any foreigner who is living among you who hunts any animal or
bird that is permitted for you to eat, must drain out the blood of the animal or bird
that he kills, and cover the blood with dirt.
14 This is because the life of every creature is in its blood. And that is why I have
said [DOU] to you Israelis that anyone who eats blood must no longer be allowed to
associate with my people.
15 ‘Anyone in Israel, including foreigners, who eats any of the meat of any creature
that is found dead, or that had been killed by wild animals, must wash his clothes
and bathe. Then he must not touch anyone until that evening.
16 If he does not do those things, he will be punished for what he did.’ ”

your God.

people in Canaan, the land to which I am taking you. Do not imitate their behavior.
4 You must obey all of my laws [DOU], because it is I, Yahweh your God, who am
commanding those laws.
5 If you obey all my laws and decrees, you will continue to remain alive for a long
time. I, Yahweh, am the one who is promising that to you. These are some of my laws:
6 “Do not have sex with any of your close relatives. It is I, Yahweh, who am
commanding that.
7 “Do not disgrace your father by having sex with your mother [DOU].
8 “Do not have sex with any of your father’s other wives, because that would
disgrace your father.
9 “Do not have sex with your sister or your stepsister; it does not matter whether
she was born in your house or somewhere else.
10 “Do not have sex with your granddaughter, because that would disgrace you.
11 “Do not have sex with your half-sister, because she is your sister.
12 “Do not have sex with your father’s sister, because she is your father’s close
relative.

14 “Do not disgrace your ◄uncle/father’s brother► by having sex with his wife,
because she is your aunt.
15 “Do not have sex with [DOU] your daughter-in-law, because she is your son’s
wife.
16 “Do not have sex with your brother’s wife, because that would disgrace your
brother.
17 “Do not have sex with the daughter or granddaughter of any woman whom you
have previously had sex with; they are her (OR, your) close relatives. Having sex with
any of them would be a wicked thing to do.
18 “While your wife is still living, do not marry your wife’s sister and have sex with
her.
19 “Do not have sex with any woman while she is having her monthly menstrual
period.
20 “Do not ◄defile yourself/make yourself unacceptable to me► by having sex with
someone else’s wife.
21 “Do not give any of your children to be burned to be a sacrifice to the god Molech,
because that would show that you do not revere me [MTY], Yahweh, your God.
22 “No man should have sex with another man; that is detestable.
23 “No one, man or woman, should ◄defile himself/ cause himself to become

27 All those detestable things were done by the people who lived in this land before
you came here, and they caused the land to become defiled.
28 So if you defile the land, I will get rid of [MET] you like I got rid of the people of
those nations that were here before you came.

with you who are my people.

practicing any of the detestable customs that were practiced by the people who were
there before you came. I, Yahweh your God, am the one who is commanding these
things.”

Other laws

6 The meat should be eaten on the day that you sacrifice it, but you are permitted
to eat some of it on the next day. Anything that remains until the third/next day must
be completely burned.
7 For any of it to be eaten on the third day is very displeasing to me, and I will not
accept that offering.
8 I will punish anyone who eats it after the second day, because he will not have
respected that what I say is holy. And that person must no longer be allowed to
associate with my people.
9 ‘Then you harvest your grain, leave the grain at the very edge of the field, and do
not pick up the grain that has fallen on the ground.
10 And when you harvest your grapes, do not go back a second time to try to harvest

21 However, that man must bring a ram to be slaughtered at the entrance of the
Sacred Tent area, to be an offering in order that he no longer be guilty for his sin.
22 The priest will offer that ram to me in order that the man will be forgiven for
the sin that he committed, and I will forgive him.

Punishments for various sins
1 Yahweh also said this to Moses/me:
2 “Tell the Israeli people, ‘This is what Yahweh says:
Any Israeli or any foreigner
who is living in Israel who sacrifices any of his children to be an offering to the god
Molech must be executed. The people of the town must kill him by throwing stones
at him.
3 I will reject [IDM] such people and command that they no longer be allowed to
associate with my people.
4 If the people of that man’s town ignore it when he kills one of his children to offer
him as a sacrifice to Molech, and if they do not execute that person,
5 I myself will punish that person and his family, and I will command that he no
longer be able to associate with my people. And I will do the same thing to any others
who do the same thing that he did to worship Molech.
6 ‘ will reject [IDM] those who go to those who ◄consult/talk with► the spirits of
dead people and fortune-tellers to seek advice from them. I will command that they
no longer be allowed to associate with my people.

want you to be like me.

10 ‘If a man commits adultery with some other man’s wife, both of them, the man

11 ‘If a man has sex with [EUP] one of his father’s wives, he has disgraced his father.
So both that man and that woman must be executed, they will be responsible for their

12 ‘If a man has sex with [EUP] his daughter-in-law, both of them must be executed.
What they have done is very perverse; and they will be responsible for their own

13 ‘If two men have sex together, they have done something detestable. They must
both be executed, they will be responsible for their own deaths [MTY].
14 ‘If a man marries both a woman and her mother, that is a wicked thing. All
three of them must be burned to death, in order that such a wicked practice will not
continue to be done among you.
15 ‘If a man has sex with an animal, he must be executed, and you must also kill
that animal.
16 ‘Similarly, if a woman has sex with an animal, both the woman and that animal

17 ‘If a man marries his sister, the daughter of either his mother or his father, and

21
Rules for priests
1 Yahweh also said to Moses/me, “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say
to them,
2 ‘You priests must not cause yourselves to become unfit to do my work by touching
corpses. Priests are permitted to touch only the corpses of close relatives, such as the
priest’s mother or father or his son or daughter or his brother.
3 Priests are also permitted to touch the corpse of a sister if she is not married,
because she has no husband to bury her body.
4 Priests must not cause themselves to become unfit to do my work [DOU] by
touching corpses of people who were married to one of their close relatives.
5 You priests must not shave your heads or shave the edges of your beards or cut
your bodies to show that you are mourning for someone who has died.
6 You must act in ways that I, your God, consider to be holy, and not disgrace my
name/reputation. You are the ones who present to me the offerings that are burned.
It is as though those offerings are food for me, your God; so you must act in ways
that are holy.
7 You priests must not marry women who have been prostitutes or who have been
divorced from their husbands, because you priests are ◄set apart for me/holy►.
8 You must consider that you are holy, because you offer food to me, your God.
Consider yourselves to be holy because I, Yahweh, the one who caused you to be
priests and the one who enables you to be holy, am holy.
9 If a priest’s daughter disgraces herself by becoming a prostitute, she disgraces her
father; and she must be killed by being burned in a fire.
10 The Supreme Priest is the one among his relatives who has been appointed for
that work by having his head anointed with olive oil. He is also the one who has
been appointed to wear the special garments that priests wear. He must not allow
the hair on his head to remain uncombed, and he must not tear his clothes when he
is mourning for someone.
11 He must not enter some place where there is a corpse. He must not do that and
cause himself to become unfit for his work, even if it is his father or his mother who
has died.
12 He must not leave the Sacred Tent to join those who are mourning, because he
would cause himself to become unfit for his work and would also defile/desecrate
the Sacred Tent. He must not leave the Sacred Tent at that time, because by being
anointed with olive oil he has been ◄appointed/set apart► to serve his God in the
Sacred Tent. I, Yahweh, am the one who am commanding this.
13 Women whom you priests marry must be virgins.
14-15 You priests must not marry widows or prostitutes or divorced women, because
if you did that, if you later have sons, they would not be acceptable to be priests
among your people. You must marry only virgins from among your own people. I
am Yahweh, who sets priests apart to be holy.’ ”
16 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
17 “Say this to Aaron: 'For all future time, none of your descendants who has any
defects on his body will be allowed to come near the altar to offer sacrifices to me
which will be like [MET] my food:
LEVITICUS 21:18
182
LEVITICUS 22:13
18 No one who is blind or lame or deformed, or whose face is disfigured,
19 no man with a crippled foot or a crippled hand,
20 no man who is a hunchback or a dwarf, no man whose eyes are defective, no
man who has a skin disease [DOU] or whose testicles have been damaged is allowed
to brings sacrifices.
21 No descendant of Aaron, the first Supreme Priest, who has any defect is allowed
to come to the altar to offer to me, his God, sacrifices that will be burned.
22 Priests who have defects are permitted to eat the various kinds of holy food
offered to me.
23 But because of their defects, they must not go near the curtain in the Sacred Tent
or near the altar, because if they did that, they would desecrate my Sacred Tent. I am
Yahweh, the one who sets those places apart as being holy.' ”
24 So Moses/I told this to Aaron and to his sons and to all the Israeli people.
2 “Tell Aaron and his sons to greatly respect the sacred offerings that the Israeli
people bring to me; by doing that you will respect me [MTY], Yahweh.
sacred offerings that the Israeli people dedicate to me while he is unfit to work for
me, that person will no longer be allowed to work for me. I, Yahweh, am commanding
this.
4 “If any descendant of Aaron has a contagious skin disease or a discharge from his
sexual organs, he is not allowed to eat any of the sacred offerings until he is cured. He
will also be unfit for his work if he touches anything which has become unacceptable
to me because it has touched a corpse, or if he touches anyone who as an emission

who causes him to be unfit for his work.
else until that evening.
7 After the sun sets, he will be permitted to eat some of the sacred offerings that
are for him to eat.
8 He must not eat anything that is found dead or that has been killed by wild
animals, because if he did that, he would be unfit to work for me. I, Yahweh am
commanding those things.
9 “The priests must obey my commandments in order that they will not become
guilty and die as a result of ◄despising/not obeying► them.
10 “Anyone who is not a member of a priest’s family is not permitted to eat any of
a sacred offering, and no one who is visiting the priest or whom the priest has hired
is permitted to eat it.
11 But if a priest buys a slave, or if a slave is born in his house, that slave is permitted
to eat such food.
12 If a priest’s daughter marries a man who is not a priest, she no longer is permitted
to eat the sacred food.
13 But if a priest’s daughter who has no children becomes a widow or becomes
divorced, if she returns to her father’s house to live there like she did when she
was young, she may eat the same food that her father eats. But no other person is
permitted to eat any of it.
LEVITICUS 22:14
183
LEVITICUS 23:2
14 “If anyone who is not permitted to eat a sacred offering eats it without realizing
that it is sacred, he must pay the priest for the offering, and pay him an extra one-fifth
of its value.
15 When the priests bring offerings to me, the sacred offerings that the Israeli people
bring to them, they must not treat those offerings as though they are not sacred
16 by allowing those who are not priests to eat any of those offerings. If they did
that, they would become guilty and must make a payment. I am Yahweh, the one
who causes those offerings to be sacred.”
Offerings that are not acceptable
17 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
an animal that will be completely burned on the altar, either as a result of a solemn
promise that you made to me or to be an offering that is given voluntarily,
19 it must be an animal that has no defects, in order that it will be accepted by me.
20 Do not bring any animals that have defects, because I will not accept them as an
offering from you.
21 Similarly, when someone brings from his cattle or sheep or goats an offering to
maintain fellowship with me, either to fulfill a promise that he made to me or to be
a voluntary offering, in order that I will accept it, it must have no defects [DOU] or
blemishes.
22 Do not offer to me animals that are blind or injured or maimed/crippled, or any
animal that has warts or a festering sore [DOU].
23 You may present to me to be a voluntary offering an ox or a sheep that is injured
or stunted, but it will not be accepted to fulfill a promise made to me.
24 You must not offer to me animals whose testicles are bruised or crushed or torn
or cut. You must not injure the testicles of any animal in your land,
25 and you must not accept such animals that are sold/given to you by a foreigner.
You must not offer them to me as a sacrifice for me. Such animals will not be accepted
by me, because they are deformed or have defects.’ ”
26 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
27 “When a calf or lamb or goat is born, it must remain with its mother for seven
days. After that, it will be acceptable as an offering to me that will be burned.
28 Do not slaughter a cow or a sheep and its baby on the same day.
29 “Then you sacrifice an animal to thank me for what I have done, sacrifice it in a
way that is acceptable to me.
30 The meat must be eaten on that day; do not leave any of it until the next morning.
I, Yahweh, am the one who am commanding this.
31 “Obey all my commands [DOU]. I, Yahweh, am commanding them;
32 do not dishonor me [MTY] by disobeying them.
You Israeli people must
acknowledge that I, Yahweh, am holy, and I am the one who causes you to be holy.
33 And I am the one who brought you out of Egypt in order to show that that I,
Yahweh, am and will always be your God.”
23
Religious celebrations
1 Yahweh said to Moses/me,
2 “Tell the Israeli people about the festivals that I have chosen, the days when you
all must gather together to worship me.”
LEVITICUS 23:3
184
LEVITICUS 23:18
The Sabbath
3 “You may work for six days each week, but on the seventh day you must not do
worship me. Wherever you live, you must rest on that day.”
days when you must gather together to worship me.
5 The first festival is ◄the Passover/when you remember that I spared your ancestors
when I killed all the firstborn Egyptian sons►. That festival will begin at twilight/dusk/
sunset on the chosen day ◄each spring/in March or April each year►, and end on the
following day.
6 The next day, the Festival of Eating Bread That Has No Yeast will begin. That
festival will continue for seven days. During that time, the bread that you eat must
be made without yeast.
7 On the first day of that festival, you all must stop your regular work and you must
gather together to worship me.
8 On each of the seven days, you must present to me several animals to be an
offering/sacrifice to be completely burned on the altar. On the seventh day, you
all must again stop your regular work and gather to worship me.”
The Festival of the Beginning of the Harvest
9 Yahweh also told Moses/me
10 to tell the Israeli people about other festivals. He said, “When you arrive in the
land which I am giving to you, and you harvest your crops for the first time there,
bring to the priest some of the first grain that you harvest.
11 On the day after the next Sabbath/rest day, the priest will lift it up high to dedicate
it to me, in order that I will accept it as your gift.
12 That same day, you must sacrifice to me a one-year-old male lamb that has no
defects. You must burn it on the altar.
13 You must also burn an offering of grain. That offering must consist of ◄three
quarts/3.5 liters► of good flour mixed with olive oil. The smell of those things burning
will be very pleasing to me. Along with that, you must also offer one quart/liter of
wine, which will be a liquid offering.
14 Do not eat any bread or any roasted grain or unroasted grain on that day until
after you have brought those offerings to me, your God. You must always obey [LIT]
those commands, wherever you live.”
The Festival of the End of the Harvest
15 “Seven weeks after the priest offers that grain to me,
16 on the next/50th day after he offers it, each family must bring to me an offering
from the new crop of grain.
17 From your homes, bring two loaves of bread to the priest. He will lift them up
high to dedicate them as an offering to me. Those loaves must be baked from three
quarts/liters of good flour that has yeast mixed with it. That bread will be an offering
to me from the first wheat that you harvest each year.
18 Along with this bread, you must present to me seven one-year-old lambs with
no defects, one young bull, and two rams. They must all be completely burned on
the altar. All those offerings, with the grain offering and the wine offering, will be
burned, and the smell of all those things burning will be very pleasing to me.
LEVITICUS 23:19
185
LEVITICUS 23:36
19 Then you must also kill one male goat to be an offering/sacrifice for your sins, and
two one-year-old male lambs to be an offering to enable you to maintain fellowship
with me.
20 The priest will lift up these offerings high to dedicate them to me. He will also
offer the loaves of bread that were baked from the first wheat that you harvest. Those
offerings are sacred to me, but they are for the priests to eat.
21 On that day, you must stop your regular work and gather to worship me. You
must always obey those instructions/commands, and you must obey them wherever
you live.
22 “When you harvest the grain in your fields, do not harvest the grain along the
edges of the fields, and do not pick up the grain that the harvesters drop. Leave that
grain for the poor people and for the foreigners who are living among you. Do not
forget that it is I, Yahweh your God, who am commanding those things!”
The Festival of Trumpets
23 Yahweh also told Moses/me
24 to give these instructions/ commands
to the Israeli people: “Each year in
September, on the day that I have chosen, you all must celebrate it by completely
resting. You must not do any work on that day. When the priests blow their trumpets
loudly, you all must gather together to worship me.
25 All of you must not do your regular work on that day. Instead, you must present
offerings to me that will be burned on the altar.”
The Festival of Atonement
26 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
27 “You must celebrate a day on which you request that I forgive you for the sins that
you have committed. That day will be nine days after the festival when the priests
blow the trumpets. On that day you must ◄fast/abstain from eating food►. You must
gather together to worship me and present offerings to me that will be burned on the
altar.
28 You must not do any work on that day, because it is the day when the priests will
offer sacrifices to me to ◄atone for/ask me to forgive► your sins.
29 You must expel from your group anyone who does not ◄fast/abstain from eating
food► on that day.
30 I will get rid of anyone who does any kind of work on that day.
31 You must not work at all! You must always obey those instructions/commands,
and you must obey them wherever you live.
32 That day will be a day of complete rest for all of you, and on that day you must
◄fast/abstain from eating food► to show that you are sorry for having sinned. That day
of rest and ◄fasting/abstaining from eating food► will begin on the evening before
the day in which you ask me to forgive you for your sins, and it will end on the
evening of the following day.”
The Festival of Shelters
34 “Tell the Israeli people that each year they must also celebrate a festival of living
in temporary shelters. That festival will begin five days after the day in which they
35 On the first day of that festival, the people must gather together to worship me,
and they must not do any regular work on that day.
36 On each of the seven days of the festival, they must present to me an offering of
animals that will be burned on the altar. On the next day, they must gather again to
LEVITICUS 23:37
186
LEVITICUS 24:8
worship me and present to me another animal that will be burned on the altar. That
also will be a sacred gathering, and they must not work on that day, either.
37 “To summarize, those are the festivals that I have appointed. Celebrate those
sacred festivals by gathering together to present to me all the various offerings that
will be burned on the altar—animals that will be burned completely, and offerings of
grain, and offerings to enable the Israeli people to maintain fellowship with me, and
offerings of wine. Each offering must be brought on the day that I have indicated.
38 ◄Those festivals must be celebrated/ You must celebrate those festivals► in
addition to worshiping on the ◄Sabbath days/days of rest►. And all those offerings
must be given in addition to the offerings that people personally decide to give, and
in addition to the offerings that people make to accompany the solemn promises that
they have made, or offerings that people make ◄voluntarily/because they themselves
want to►.
39 “Returning to my instructions about the Festival of Living in Temporary Shelters,
you must celebrate this festival after you have harvested all the crops. On the first
day and on the last day of that festival, you must rest completely.
40 But on the first day, you are permitted to pick fruit from trees. Cut palm fronds/
branches and other leafy branches from trees or from bushes that grow by the
streams, and make shelters/huts to live in for that week. Then rejoice in my presence
for those seven days.
41 You must celebrate this festival for seven days every year. You must never
stop obeying my commands/instructions for that festival. You must celebrate it in
September.
42 During the seven days of that festival, all of you people who have been Israelis
your entire lives must live in shelters/huts.
43 That will remind your descendants that their ancestors lived in shelters for many
years after I rescued them from Egypt. Do not forget that I, Yahweh your God, am the
one who is commanding this.”
44 So Moses/I gave to the Israeli people all those instructions concerning the festivals
that Yahweh wanted them to celebrate each year.
24
Taking care of the lamps
1 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
2 “Command the Israeli people to continually bring to you clear oil made from
pressed olives to burn in the lamps in the Sacred Tent, in order that those lamps will
burn all the time.
3 Outside the curtain of the Very Holy Place, Aaron must take care of the lamps
in my presence continually, in order that they will burn all during the night. That
regulation must be obeyed forever.
5 “Also, each week you must take some fine flour and bake twelve very big loaves
6 Put the loaves in two rows, with six loaves in each row, on the table covered with
pure gold, in my presence.
7 Along each row, place in some gold cups some pure incense to be burned to be an
offering to me instead of the bread.
8 New/Fresh loaves of bread must be put on the table each Sabbath day, to signify
the agreement that will never end, that I have made with you Israeli people.
LEVITICUS 24:9
187
LEVITICUS 25:4
9 The bread that is taken off the table belongs to Aaron and his sons. They must eat
it in a holy place, because it is a very holy part of the offerings that are given to me
by being burned.”
An example of fair punishment
10-11 There was a man whose mother’s name was Shelomith; she was an Israeli
whose father was Dibri from the tribe of Dan. And that man’s father was from Egypt.
One day that man and another Israeli man started to fight inside the camp. And while
they were fighting, that man cursed Yahweh [MTY].
12 So the Israeli people seized him and guarded him until they could find out what
Yahweh would reveal to them that they should do to that man.
13 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me,
14 “Tie up and take outside the camp the man who has cursed me. There all those
who heard what he said must put their hands on his head to indicate that he is guilty,
and then all the people must kill him by throwing stones at him.
15 Tell the Israelis, ‘If anyone curses me, he must ◄endure the consequences/be
punished►.
16 So anyone who curses me [MTY] must be executed. All the people must throw
stones at him. It does not matter if he is a foreigner or an Israeli citizen; anyone who
curses me must be executed.’
17 “Also, If anyone murders another person, he must be executed.
18 And anyone who kills another person’s animal must give that person a live animal
to replace the one that he killed.
19 And if one person injures another person, the injured person is allowed to injure
the person who injured him in the same way:
20 If someone breaks one of another person’s bones, that person is allowed to break
one of the bones of the person who injured him. If someone gouges out an eye of
another person, that person is allowed to gouge out the eye of the person who injured
him. If someone knocks out the tooth of another person, that person is allowed to
knock out one of his teeth. What is done to the offender must be the same as what
he did to the other person.
21 Whoever kills another person’s animal must give that person a live animal to
replace the one that he killed, but anyone who murders another person must be
executed.
22 That law applies to you Israelis and and also to the foreigners who live among
you; I, Yahweh your God am the one who has commanded it.”
23 Then Moses/I told the Israelis what they must do to the man who cursed Yahweh,
did what Yahweh commanded Moses/me to tell them to do.
25
The seventh year
1 Yahweh said to Moses/me on Sinai Mountain,
2 “Tell the Israelis that I, Yahweh, say this: When you enter the land that I am about
to give you, every seventh year you must honor me by not planting any seeds. You
will be allowing the ground to rest.
3 For six years you are to plant seeds in your fields and prune your grapevines and
harvest the crops.
4 But the seventh/next year you must dedicate to me, and allow your fields to rest.
Do not plant seeds in your fields or prune your grapevines during that year.
LEVITICUS 25:5
188
LEVITICUS 25:23
5 Do not reap the grain that grows in your fields without having been planted, or
harvest the grapes that grow without the vines being pruned; you must allow the land
to rest for that one year.
6 But you are permitted to eat whatever crops grow by themselves during that
year without having been planted. You and your male and female servants, and
workers whom you have hired, and people who are living among you temporarily
are permitted to eat it.
7 Also, during that year your livestock and the wild animals in your land are
permitted to eat it.’
The fiftieth year
8-9 ‘Also, after every 49 years has ended, you must do this:
◄On the tenth day of
the seventh month/At the end of September► of the next/50th year, blow trumpets
throughout the country, to declare that it will be a day on which you request that I
forgive you for the sins that you have committed.
10 Set apart that year, and proclaim that throughout the country, it will be a year
of restoring the land and freeing people: All the people who sold their property will
receive back the property that they previously owned, and slaves must be ◄freed/
allowed to return to their property and their families►.
11 That year will be a Year of Celebration; during that year do not plant anything,
and do not harvest in the usual way the grain/wheat that grows without having been
planted, or the grapes that grow without the vines being pruned.
12 It will be a Year of Celebration, so eat only what grows in the fields ◄by itself/
without any work being done to produce anything►.
13 ‘In that Year of Celebration, everyone must return to their own property.
14 ‘If you sell some of your land to a fellow Israeli or if you buy some land from
one of them, you must treat that person fairly:
15 If you buy land, the price that you will pay will depend on the number of years
will charge a price that is determined by the number of years until the next Year of
16 If there will be many years before the next Year of Celebration, the price will be
will be lower. You could say that what he is really selling you is the number of crops
which you can harvest before the next Year of Celebration.
17 Do not cheat each other; instead, revere me. I, Yahweh your God, am the one
who am commanding this.
18 ‘Obey all my laws [DOU] carefully. If you do that, you will continue to live safely
in your country [DOU].
19 And crops will grow well on the land, and you will have plenty to eat.
20 But you may ask, “If we do not plant or harvest our crops during the seventh
year, what will we have to eat?”
21 My answer is that I will bless you very much during the sixth/previous year, with
the result that during that year there will be enough crops to provide food for you
for three years!
22 Then, after you plant seed during the eighth/next year and wait for the crops to
grow, you will eat the food grown in the sixth year, and continue to eat it until more
food is harvested in the ninth year!
23 ‘You must not sell any of your land to belong to someone else permanently,
because the land is not yours, it; is really mine, and you are only living on it
temporarily and ◄farming/taking care of► it for me.
LEVITICUS 25:24
24 Throughout
189
LEVITICUS 25:43
the country that you will possess, you must remember that if
someone sells some of his land to you, he is permitted to buy it back from you if
he wants to.
25 ‘So, if one of your fellow Israelis becomes poor and sells some of his property
to obtain some money, the person who is most closely related to him is permitted to
come and buy that land for him.
26 However, if a man has no one to buy the land for him, and he himself prospers
again and saves enough money to buy that land back,
27 he must calculate how many years there will be until the next Year of Celebration.
Then he must pay to the man who bought the land the money that he would have
earned by continuing to grow crops on that land for those years.
28 But if the original owner does not have any money to buy the land that he sold, it
will continue to belong to the man who bought it, until the next Year of Celebration.
In that year it must be returned to its original owner, and he will be able to live on it
again.
29 ‘If someone who lives in a city that has a wall around it sells a house there,
during the next year he will be permitted to buy it from the man who bought it.
30 If he does not buy it during that year, it will belong permanently to the man who
bought it and to his descendants. It must not be returned to the original owner in
the Year of Celebration.
31 But houses that are in villages that do not have walls around them are considered
to be as though they are in a field. So if someone sells one of those houses, he is
him in the Year of Celebration.
are permitted to buy them back at any time.
other Israelis, that land will become theirs again in the Year of Celebration if they do
not buy it back before then.
34 But the pastureland near their towns must not be sold. It must belong to the
original owners permanently/forever.
35 ‘If one of your fellow Israelis becomes poor and is unable to buy what he needs
[IDM], others of you must help him like you would help a foreigner who is living
among you [DOU] temporarily.
36 If you lend money to him, do not charge any kind of interest [DOU]. Instead, show
by what you do that you revere me, your God, and help that man, in order that he
will be able to continue to live among you.
37 If you lend him money, do not charge interest; and if you sell food to him, charge
him only what you paid for it; do not get a profit from it.
38 Do not forget that I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of Egypt to be
your God and to give you the land of Canaan, and I did not charge you for doing that.
39 ‘If one of your fellow Israelis becomes poor and sells himself to you, do not force
him to work like a slave.
40 Treat him like you treat workers that you hire or like someone who is living on
your land temporarily. But he must work for you only until the Year of Celebration.
41 During that year, you must free him, and he will go back to his family and to the
property that his ancestors owned.
42 It is as though you Israelis are my slaves/servants, whom I freed from being slaves
in Egypt. So none of you should be sold to become slaves.
43 And do not treat the Israelis whom you buy cruelly; instead, revere me, your
God.
LEVITICUS 25:44
190
LEVITICUS 26:8
44 ‘If you want to have slaves, you are permitted to buy them from nearby countries.
45 You are also permitted to buy some of the foreigners who are living among you,
and members of their clans that were born in your country. Then you will own them.
46 They will be your slaves for the remaining years of your life, and after you die,
it is permitted for your children to own them. But you must not act in brutal ways
toward your fellow Israelis.
47 ‘If a foreigner who is living among you [DOU] becomes rich, and if one of your
fellow Israelis becomes poor and sells himself to that foreigner or to a member of his
clan/family,
48 it is permitted for someone to pay for him to be freed. It is permitted for one of
his relatives to pay for him to be released:
49 An uncle or a cousin or another relative in his clan may pay for him to be released.
Or, if he prospers and gets enough money, he is permitted to pay for his own release.
50 The man who wants to pay for his own release must count the number of years
until the next Year of Celebration. The price he pays to the man who bought him will
depend on the pay that would be given to a hired worker for that number of years.
51 If there are a lot of years that remain until the Year of Celebration, he must pay
52 If there are only a few years that remain until the Year of Celebration, he must
53 During the years that he is working for the man who bought him, the man who
bought him must treat him like he would treat a hired worker, and all of you must
make sure that his owner does not treat him cruelly.
54 ‘And even if a fellow Israeli who has sold himself to a rich man is not able to pay
for himself to be freed by any of these ways, he and his children must be freed in the
Year of Celebration,
55 because it is as though you Israelis are my slaves/servants, whom I, Yahweh your
God, freed from being slaves in Egypt.’ ”

Promised blessings for obeying Yahweh
1 Yahweh also said this to Moses/me on Sinai Mountain: “Do not make idols or set
up statues of false gods or sacred stones to worship other gods. And do not put on
your property a stone that has been shaped to resemble a false god and bow down to
worship it. You must worship only me, Yahweh, your God.
2 “Honor the Sabbath days and revere my Sacred Tent, because I, Yahweh, live there.
3 “If you carefully obey all my commands [DOU],
4 I will send rain for you at the proper/right times, in order that crops will grow on
your land and there will be plenty of fruit on your trees.
5 You will continue harvesting and threshing grain until it is time to harvest grapes,
and you will continue to harvest grapes until it is time to start planting things in the
following year. And you will have all the food that you want to eat, and you will live
safely in your land.
6 “If you obey all my laws, there will be peace in your country, and when you lie
down to sleep, nothing will cause you to be afraid. I will get rid of the dangerous
animals in your country, and there will no wars [MTY] in your country.
7 You will pursue your enemies and kill them with your swords:
8 Five of you will pursue 100 of them, and 100 of you will pursue 1,000 of them and
kill them with your swords.
LEVITICUS 26:9
191
LEVITICUS 26:26
9 “If you obey all my laws, I will bless you and cause you to have many children
[DOU]. And I will do what I said that I would do in the agreement that I made with
you.
10 When you are still eating food from the harvest from the previous year, it will
be necessary for you to throw away some of it to make space for the new harvest.
11 I will live among you in my Sacred Tent, and I will never reject you.
12 I will walk among you and continue to be your God, and you will continue to be
my people.
13 I am Yahweh your God, the one who brought you out of Egypt in order that you
treated as though you were animals that worked for the people of Egypt, but [MET] I
you to walk with your heads up.”
Threatened punishments for disobeying Yahweh
14 “But if you will not heed me and obey all these commands,
15 and if you reject [DOU] my decrees and laws, and do not do [DOU] what I
commanded you to do in the agreement that I made with you,
16 these are the things that I will do to you: I will suddenly cause there to be disasters
that will ruin you. You will have diseases that cannot be cured, and fevers that will
cause you to become blind and will slowly kill you. It will be useless for you to plant
seeds, because your enemies will eat the crops that grow.
17 I will reject/abandon you [IDM], with the result that you will be defeated by your
enemies. Then those who hate you will rule you, and you will be so terrified that you
will run away even when no one is pursuing you.
18 “If you still will not heed me after all those things happen to you, I will continue
to punish you again and again for the sins that you have committed.
19 I will cause you to no longer be stubborn and proud; I will cause no rain to fall;
it will be as though [MET] the sky is made of iron; and the ground will be as hard as
brass [MET].
20 You will uselessly work very hard to plant seeds, because crops will not grow in
the hard soil in your fields, and fruit will not grow on your trees.
21 “If you continue to oppose me and refuse to heed me, I will cause you to
experience disasters again and again, like you deserve to experience because of your
sins.
22 I will send wild animals to attack you, and they will kill your little children and
destroy your cattle. There will be very few of you who will remain alive, with the
result that there will be very few [HYP] people walking on the roads in your country.
23 “When you experience those things that I do to punish you, if you still do not pay
attention to me, and if you continue to oppose me,
24 I myself will oppose you, and I will punish you for your sins again and again.
25 I will send foreign armies [MTY] to punish you for not doing the things that I
commanded you to do in the agreement that I made with you. If you try to escape
from your enemies by shutting yourselves in your cities that have walls around them, I
will cause you to experience plagues, and I will allow your enemies to capture [IDM]
you.
26 When I cut off your food supply, there will be very little flour with which to make
bread. As a result, ten women will be able to bake all their bread in only one oven.
When the bread is baked, each woman will divide it among the members of her family,
but there will be very little for each one, and when they have eaten all of it, they will
still be hungry.
LEVITICUS 26:27
192
LEVITICUS 26:46
27 “After all those things happen, if you still do not heed me, if you still oppose me,
28 I will be very angry with you, and I will oppose you, and I myself will punish
29 You will be extremely hungry, with the result that you will kill your sons and
30 I will cause the shrines where you worship idols on hilltops to be destroyed. I will
corpses to be piled on the lifeless statues of your gods. And I will detest you.
31 I will cause your cities to become heaps of ruins, and I will cause the buildings
that are dedicated to the worship of your gods to be smashed. And I will not be
pleased at all with the aroma of your offerings that are burned on the altar.
32 I will completely ruin your country, with the result that even your enemies who
capture it will be shocked/appalled when they see it.
33 I will enable your enemies to kill you with their swords, and I will cause the rest
of you to be scattered among other nations. Your country will be ruined and your
cities will become ruins.
34 After that happens, as long as you are living in your enemies’ countries, your
land will be allowed to rest, like you should have allowed it to rest every seven years.
35 All the time that your land is desolate, it will be able to rest, like you did not
enable it to rest during all the years that you lived there.
36 “As for you people who will remain alive in the countries to which your enemies
will have taken you, I will cause you to become so afraid that when you hear the
sound of leaves being blown by the wind, you will run away. You will run like [SIM]
you are running from a man carrying a sword, and you will fall down, even though
no one is pursuing you.
37 You will stumble over each other. So you will not be able to stand and fight your
enemies.
38 Many of you will die in the countries that belong to your enemies [DOU].
39 And those of you who remain alive will slowly die and rot in the countries of
your enemies because of your sins and because of the sins of your ancestors.
40-41 “But your descendants must confess their sins and the sins that their ancestors
committed. Their ancestors acted unfaithfully toward me and were hostile to me, with
the result that I forced them to go to the countries that belonged to their enemies.
But when your descendants humble themselves [SYN] and stop being very stubborn
[IDM] and accept being punished for their sins,
42 I will remember the agreement that I made with your ancestors Abraham and
Isaac and Jacob, and what I promised them about this land.
that the land will be able to rest while it is desolate and while the people are being
44 But when that happens, I will still not reject them or hate them and destroy them
completely. I will not cancel the agreement that I made with them; for I am still
Yahweh their God.
45 I will ◄remember/never forget► the agreement that I made with your ancestors
when I brought them out of Egypt, in order that the people of all nations will know
that I, Yahweh, will continue to be your God.”
46 Those
are the decrees, the laws, and the regulations [DOU] that Yahweh
established on Sinai Mountain between himself and the Israeli people by giving them
to Moses/me to tell to them.

LEVITICUS 27:18
Making promises about gifts to Yahweh
1 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
dedicated to me is allowed to be free from having to do that by someone paying
to the priest a fixed amount of money. The money that is given must be calculated
by comparing it with the official pieces of silver in the Sacred Tent.
3 These are the amounts that must be paid:
50 pieces of silver for men who are between 20 and 60 years old,
4 30 pieces of silver for adult women who are between 20 and 60 years old,
5 20 pieces of silver for young men who are between five and 20 years old,
ten pieces of silver for young women who are between five and 20 years old,
6 five pieces of silver for boys who are between one month and five years old,
three pieces of silver for girls who are between one month and five years old,
7 15 pieces of silver for men who are more than 60 years old,
ten pieces of silver for women who are more than 60 years old.
8 ‘If anyone who has made such a solemn promise is very poor and unable to pay,
to free that person from doing what he had promised, he must take that person to the
priest. The priest will set the price for freeing him to be what the person who made
that solemn promise is able to pay.
9 ‘If someone solemnly promises to give an animal that is acceptable to be an
offering to me, that animal becomes sacred and belongs to me.
10 The person who promised to give it must not give another animal instead of the
one that he promised; he must not substitute a bad animal for a good one or even a
better one than the one offered. If he would substitute one animal for the other, both
animals would belong to me.
11 If the animal that he wishes to dedicate to me is a kind that is unacceptable to
be an offering to me, he must take that animal to the priest.
12 The priest will then decide what its value is, according to the animal’s good and
bad points. Whatever value the priests sets will be the value of the animal, and that
is the price that the priest must pay for the animal.
13 If the man who gave the animal later decides that he wants to buy it back, he
must pay to the priest that price plus an additional 20 percent.
14 ‘Similarly, if someone dedicates his house to be a sacred gift to belong to me, the
priest will decide how much it is worth, which will depend on whether the house is
in good condition. Whatever the priest says that it is worth, that will be its value and
that is the price that the priest must pay for it.
15 If the man who dedicated his house to me later wants to buy it back, he must
pay that price plus an additional 20 percent, and then the house will belong to him
again.
16 ‘If someone dedicates to me some of the property that belongs to him and his
family, its value will be determined by the number of bushels of seed that will be
needed to plant seeds on that land: Its value will be ten pieces of silver for each
bushel of seed.
17 If he dedicates the land during the Year of Celebration, its full value will be that
amount.
18 But if he dedicates the field after the Year of Celebration, the priest will count the
number of years until the next Year of Celebration, and if there are not many years
that remain, the price will be much lower than the full price.
LEVITICUS 27:19
194
LEVITICUS 27:34
19 If the person who dedicated the field later wants to buy it back, he must pay to
the priest the price that the priest says it is worth, plus an added one-fifth, and then
the field will belong to that man again.
20 However, if he does not buy it back, or if it has been sold (OR, the priest has sold
it) to someone else, that person will never be permitted to buy it back again.
21 In the Year of Celebration, it will become sacred again, and it will be given to the
priest.
22 ‘If someone dedicates to me some land that he has bought, land which is not part
of the land that his family has always owned,
23 the priest will count the number of years until the next Year of Celebration to
determine how much it is worth, and the man must pay that amount to the priest on
that day, and then that land will belong to that man again.
24 But in the Year of Celebration, the land will again be owned by the person from
whom he bought it, the person whose family had always owned that land.
25 All the silver that is paid must be compared with the official pieces of silver in
the Sacred Tent.
26 ‘No one is permitted to dedicate to me the firstborn of any cow or sheep, because
the firstborn already belongs to me [DOU].
27 If someone gives to me a kind of animal that is not acceptable to me, that person
may later buy it back by paying what it is worth plus an additional 20 percent of its
value. If he does not buy it back, it must be sold (OR, the priest must sell it) for its
standard price.
28 ‘However, no slave or animal or family land that someone owns can be sold or
bought back after it has been dedicated to me and no price has been paid for it. That
kind of gift belongs to me permanently/forever.
29 ‘No person who has done something that I consider to be very wicked is permitted
to be freed from being punished; that person must surely be executed.
30 ‘One tenth of all the crops and grain or fruit that is produced on anyone’s land
is sacred and belongs to me.
31 If anyone wants to buy back any of that tenth, he must pay to the priest what it
is worth plus an additional 20 percent.
32 One of every ten domestic animals belongs to me. When a shepherd counts his
animals [MTY] to decide which ones he will give to me, he must mark every tenth one
as belonging to me.
33 When he does that, he must not pick out the good ones for himself or leave
the bad ones, or substitute bad ones for good ones. If he substitutes one animal for
another, both animals will belong to me, and he will not be permitted to buy them
back (OR, the shepherd cannot buy them back).’ ”
34 Those are the commands that Yahweh gave to Moses/me on Sinai Mountain to
tell to the people.

Numbers
The men of Israel were counted
1 In April of the year after the Israeli people left Egypt, Yahweh spoke to Moses/me
while he/I was in the Sacred Tent, in the Sinai Desert. Yahweh said to him/me,
battles. Write down the names of all the men who are at least 20 years old, and write
down the names of their clans and families.
4 I have chosen one man from each of the tribes to help you to do this. Each one
will be a leader of his clan.
5-15 Their names are:
Elizur, the son of Shedeur, from the tribe of Reuben;
Shelumiel, the son of Zurishaddai, from the tribe of Simeon;
Nahshon, the son of Amminadab, from the tribe of Judah;
Nethanel, the son of Zuar, from the tribe of Issachar;
Eliab, the son of Helon, from the tribe of Zebulun;
Elishama, the son of Ammihud, from the tribe of Joseph’s son Ephraim;
Gamaliel, the son of Pedahzur, from the tribe of Joseph’s son Manasseh;
Abidan, the son of Gideoni, from the tribe of Benjamin;
Ahiezer, the son of Ammishaddai, from the tribe of Dan;
Pagiel, the son of Ocran, from the tribe of Asher;
Eliasaph, the son of Deuel, from the tribe of Gad;
Ahira, the son of Enan, from the tribe of Naphtali.”
16 Those were the men whom Yahweh chose from the people.
They were leaders
of their tribes. They were the chief men of the clans of the Israeli people.
17 Aaron and Moses/I summoned all these leaders,
18 and they gathered all of the people together on that same day. They listed/wrote
down the names of all the men who were at least 20 years old, and with their names
they wrote the names of their clans and their family groups
19 just as Moses/I had commanded. They wrote the names while ◄the Israelis/we►
were there in the Sinai Desert.
20-43 This is a list of the number of men who were at least 20 years old and able to
fight in battles, and the names of their tribes:
There were 46,500 men from the tribe of Reuben (who was Jacob’s oldest son);
there were 59,300 men from the tribe of Simeon;
there were 45,560 men from the tribe of Gad;
there were 74,600 men from the tribe of Judah;
there were 54,400 men from the tribe of Issachar;
there were 57,400 men from the tribe of Zebulun;
there were 40,500 men from the tribe of Ephraim;
there were 32,200 men from the tribe of Manasseh;
there were 35,400 men from the tribe of Benjamin;
there were 62,700 men from the tribe of Dan;
there were 41,500 men from the tribe of Asher;
there were 53,400 men from the tribe of Naphtali.
NUMBERS 1:44-45
196
NUMBERS 2:12-13
44-45 That was the number of men from each tribe that Aaron and Moses/I and the
twelve leaders of the tribes of Israel listed, along with the names of their clans.
46 The total was 603,550 men.
47 But this number did not include the names of the men of the tribe of Levi,
48 because Yahweh had said to Moses/me,
49 “When you ◄count/write the names of► the men of the tribes of Israel, do not
count the men in the tribe of Levi.
50 Appoint the male descendants of Levi to take care of the Sacred Tent and the
chest inside it that contains the tablets on which are written the Ten Commandments.
They must also take care of the other things that are inside the tent. When you travel,
they are the ones who must carry the tent and all the things that are inside it, and
they must take care of it and set up their tents around it.
51 Whenever it is time for all of you to move to another location, the descendants of
Levi are the ones who must dismantle the tent. And when it is time to stop traveling,
they are the ones who must set up the Sacred Tent again. Any other person who goes
near the Sacred Tent to do this work must be executed.
52 The people of each Israeli tribe must set up their tents in their own area, and
they must set up a flag/banner that represents their tribe.
53 But the male descendants of Levi must set up their tents around the Sacred Tent,
in order to protect the other Israeli people from being punished [MTY] by Yahweh
for coming close to the Sacred Tent. The descendants of Levi are the ones who must
stand around the Sacred Tent to guard it.”
54 So the Israeli people did everything just like Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.
2
Instructions for setting up the Israeli camp
1 Then Yahweh said this to Aaron and Moses/me:
2 “When the Israelis set up their tents, they should set them up in areas that
surround the Sacred Tent, but not close to it. The people of each tribe must set
own clan and a flag that represents their tribe.
the leaders of those tribes and the number of soldiers whom they will lead:
of Judah.
5-6 Nethanel, the son of Zuar, will be the leader of the 54,500 men of the tribe of
Issachar.
7-8 Eliab, the son of Helon, will be the leader of the 57,400 men of the tribe of
Zebulun.
9 So there will be 86,400 troops on the east side of the Sacred Tent. Whenever the
Israelis move to a new location, those three tribes must go in front of the others.
10-11 The tribes of Reuben, Simeon, and Gad must set up their tents on the south
side of the Sacred Tent, close to their tribal flags. These are the names of the leaders
of those tribes and the number of men whom they will lead:
Elizur, the son of Shedeur, will be the leader of the 46,500 men of the tribe of
Reuben.
12-13 Shelumiel, the son of Zurishaddai, will be the leader of the 59,300 men of the
tribe of Simeon.
NUMBERS 2:14-15
197
NUMBERS 3:4
14-15 Eliasaph, the son of Deuel, will be the leader of the 45,650 men of the tribe
of Gad.
16 So there will be 151,450 troops on the south side of the Sacred Tent. Those
three tribes will follow the first group when the Israelis travel.
17 Behind that group will walk the descendants of Levi, who will carry the Sacred
Tent. The Israelis will march in the same order that they always set up their tents.
Each tribe will carry its own flag.
18-19 The tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin must set up their tents on
the west side of the Sacred Tent, close to their tribal flags. These are the names of
the leaders of those tribes and number of men whom they will lead:
Elishama, the son of Ammihud, will be the leader of the 40,500 men of the tribe
of Ephraim.
20-21 Gamaliel, the son of Pedahzur, will be the leader of the 32,200 men of the
tribe of Manasseh.
22-23 Abidan, the son of Gideoni, will be the leader of the 35,400 men of the tribe
of Benjamin.
24 So there will be 108,100 troops on the west side of the Sacred Tent. Those three
tribes will follow the second group, behind the descendants of Levi.
25-26 The tribes of Dan, Asher, and Naphtali must set up their tents on the north
side of the Sacred Tent, close to their tribal flags. These are the names of the leaders
of those tribes and the number of men whom they will lead:
Ahiezer, the son of Ammishaddai, will be the leader of the 62,700 men of the tribe
of Dan.
27-28 Pagiel, the son of Ocran, will be the leader of the 41,500 men of the tribe of
Asher.
29-30 Ahira, the son of Enan, will be the leader of the 53,400 men of the tribe of
Naphtali.
31 So there will be 157,600 troops on the north side of the Sacred Tent. Those
three tribes will be last. They must carry their own flags when the Israelis travel.”
32 So there were 603,550 Israeli men who were able to fight who were listed
according to their families’ ancestors.
33 But just as Yahweh had commanded, the names of the descendants of Levi
were not included.
34 The Israelis did everything that Yahweh had told Moses/me.
They set up their
tents close to their tribal flags, and when they traveled to a new location, they walked
with their own clans and family groups.

The sons of Aaron
1 These are some of the things that happened to Aaron and Moses/me when Yahweh
spoke to Moses/me on Sinai Mountain.
2 Aaron’s four sons were Nadab the oldest, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
3 They were appointed [MTY] (OR, Moses/I appointed them) to be priests.
4 But, while Yahweh was watching, Nadab and Abihu died in the Sinai Desert
because they burned incense in a manner that was different from what Yahweh had

who were left to be priests, along with their father Aaron.
6 “Bring the men of the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron, in order that they
7 They will serve Aaron and all the other Israeli people, while they do their work
inside the Sacred Tent and outside it.
8 They must serve all the Israeli people by taking care of all the things that are
inside the Sacred Tent.
9 Appoint them to help Aaron and his two sons. I have chosen them from all the
Israeli people to do that.
10 Appoint Aaron and his two sons to do the work that priests do. But anyone else
who comes close to the Sacred Tent to do that work must be executed.”
11 Yahweh also told Moses/me,
12 “Note that from all the Israelis, I have chosen the men of the tribe of Levi to take
the places of all the firstborn sons of the Israeli people. The male descendants of Levi
belong to me,
13 because truly all the firstborn males belong to me. That is because on the day
that I killed all the firstborn sons of the people of Egypt, I spared all the firstborn sons
of the Israelis and set them apart for myself. I also set apart the firstborn males of
your domestic animals. They belong to me, Yahweh.”
14 Yahweh spoke to Moses/me again in the Sinai Desert. He said,
15 “Count the male members of the tribe of Levi. Write down their names and the
names of their clans and family groups. Count all the males who are at least one
month old.”
16 So Moses/I counted them, just as Yahweh commanded.
17 Levi had three sons, whose names were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
18 Gershon had two sons: Libni and Shimei. The clans that were descended from
them had the same names as those two sons.
19 Kohath had four sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. The clans that were
descended from them had the same names as those four sons.
20 Merari had two sons: Mahli and Mushi. The clans that were descended from
them had the same names as those two sons.
Those are the clans that were descended from Levi.
21 The two clans descended from Gershon are those that were descended from his
sons Libni and Shimei.
22 In those two clans there were 7,500 males who were at least one month old.
23 They were told to set up their tents on the west side of the Sacred Tent.
24 The leader of those two clans was Eliasaph, the son of Lael.
25 Their work was to take care of the Sacred Tent, including the coverings of the
tent, the curtain at the entrance of the tent,
26 the ◄curtains/large pieces of cloth► that formed the walls around the courtyard
that is around the tent and around the altar, the curtains that were at the entrance
of the courtyard, and the ropes for fastening the tent. They also did all the work of
taking care of the things outside the Sacred Tent.
27 The clans that were descended from Kohath were those descended from his four
sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
28 In those four clans there were 8,600 males who were at least one month old. The
work of the men of the clans was to take care of the things that are inside the Sacred
Tent.
29 They set up their tents on the south side of the Sacred Tent.
30 The leader of those four clans was Elizaphan, the son of Uzziel.

on which the priest put the sacred bread, the lampstand, the altars, all the items that
the priest used in the Sacred Tent, and the curtain that is inside the tent. Their work
was also to take care of the things inside the tent.
32 Aaron’s son Eleazar was the leader of all the male descendants of Levi. He
supervised all the work that was done at the Sacred Tent.
33 The clans that were descended from Merari were those descended from his sons
Mahli and Mushi.
34 In those two clans there were 6,200 males who were at least one month old.
35 They were told to set up their tents on the north side of the Sacred Tent. The
leader of those two clans was Zuriel, the son of Abihail.
36 The work of the men of those two clans was to take care of the frames that held
up the tent, the crossbars, the pillars, and the bases. They also did all the work that
was connected with those items.
37 Their work was also to take care of the posts that held up the curtains that formed
the walls of the courtyard, and all the bases, tent pegs, and ropes that fastened those
curtains.
38 Aaron and Moses/I and Aaron’s sons were told to set up their/our tents in the
area in front of the Sacred Tent, on the east side. Their/Our work was to supervise
the work that would be done in and around the Sacred Tent, for the benefit of the
Israeli people. Only the priests were permitted to do that. Yahweh declared that we
should execute anyone else who went near the tent to do the work that the priests do.
39 When Aaron and Moses/I counted all the males who were at least one month old,
who belonged to the clans descended from Levi, the total was 22,000.
40 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Now count all the other firstborn males in Israel
who are at least one month old, and write down their names.
41 Also, set apart for me the descendants of Levi to be substitutes for the firstborn
males of the other Israelis. And set apart for me the livestock of the descendants of
Levi to be substitutes for the firstborn livestock of the other Israeli people.”
42 So Moses/I did that. He/I counted the firstborn males of all the Israeli people, as
Yahweh had commanded.
43 The total of those who were at least one month old was 22,273.
44 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me,
45 “Set apart the descendants of Levi to be substitutes for the firstborn males of the
other Israeli people. The descendants of Levi belong to me, Yahweh.
46 There are 273 more firstborn males of the other Israeli people than of the
descendants of Levi.
47-48 To pay for these 273 males, collect five pieces of silver for each of them. Each of
those pieces of silver must weigh the same as each of the silver coins that are stored
in the Sacred Tent. Give this silver to Aaron and his sons.”
49 So Moses/I did that. He/I collected the silver from those 273 males.
50 The total was 1,365 pieces of silver. Each silver coin weighed the same as each
of the silver coins stored in the Sacred Tent.
51 Moses/I gave these silver coins to Aaron and his sons, as Yahweh had commanded.

4 “The work of these descendants of Kohath will be to take care of the sacred items
that are used when the people worship at the Sacred Tent.
5 When you Israelis move to another location, Aaron and his sons must enter the
tent to take down the curtain that separates the Very Holy Place from the other part
of the Sacred Tent. They must cover the sacred chest with that curtain.
6 Then they must cover that with a nice covering made from the skins of goats.
Over that they must spread a blue cloth. Then they must insert into the rings on the
chest the poles for carrying it.
7 “Then they must put a blue cloth over the table on which the priests put the sacred
bread. On top of the cloth they must put the bowls for incense, the pans, the other
dishes, the jars for the wine that will be offered as a sacrifice, and the sacred bread.
8 Over all of this they must spread a scarlet/red cloth. Finally, they must put on top
a nice covering made from the skins of goats. Then they must insert into the rings at
the corners of the tables the poles for carrying it.
9 “Then with another blue cloth they must cover the lampstand, the lamps, the lamp
snuffers, the trays, and the special jars of olive oil to burn in the lamps.
10 They must cover the lampstand and all the other items with a nice covering made
from the skins of goats. They must place all these things on a frame for carrying them.
11 “Then they must spread another blue cloth over the gold altar which is used for
burning incense. Over this they must spread a nice covering made from the skins of
goats. Then they must insert into the rings of that altar the poles for carrying it.
them in a blue cloth, cover that with a nice covering made from the skins of goats,
13 “Then they must remove the ashes from the altar on which they have burned
sacrifices. Then they must cover the altar with a purple cloth.
14 Then they must spread on top of the cloth all the items used at the altar—the pans
for carrying the hot coals, the meat forks, the shovels, the bowls for containing the
blood to sprinkle on the people, and all the other containers. Then they must spread
over all those things a nice covering made from the skins of goats. Then they must
insert into the rings at the sides of the altar the poles for carrying it.
15 “Then Aaron and his sons have finished covering all these sacred things, the
Israeli people will be ready to move to a new location. The descendants of Kohath
must come and carry all the sacred things to the next place where you Israelis will
set up your tents. But the descendants of Kohath must not touch any of these sacred
items, because they will immediately die if they touch them. They are the ones who
will carry these things, but they must not touch them.
16 “Aaron’s son Eleazar will have the work of taking care of the olive oil for the
lamps, the nice-smelling incense, the grain which will be burned on the altar each
day, and the olive oil for anointing the priests. Eleazar is the one who will supervise
the work that is done at the Sacred Tent and the men who take care of everything
that is in it.”
17 “Then Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses/me,
18-20 “When the descendants of Kohath approach the sacred items in the Sacred Tent
to take them to another location, Aaron and his sons must always go in with them and
show each of them what work to do and what things to carry. But the descendants of

42 They/We also counted the descendants of Merari, writing also the names of their
clans and family groups.
43 They/We counted all the men who were between 30 and 50 years old who were
able to work at the Sacred Tent.
44 The total was 3,200 men.

45 They were the descendants of Merari who were able to work. Aaron and Moses/I
counted them as Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.
46 So Aaron and Moses/I and the Israeli leaders counted all the descendants of Levi,
writing also the names of their clans and family groups.
47 They/We counted all the men who were between 30 and 50 years old. They
were ones who were able to work at the Sacred Tent and who carried the tent and
everything that was connected with it.
48 The total was 8,580 men.
49 They/We completed the counting of all the descendants of Levi, as Yahweh had
commanded Moses/me. And they/we told each man what work he was to do and
what things he must carry when they moved to a new location.

Expelling those who were ritually impure
2 “Tell this to the Israeli people: ‘You must send away from your ◄camp/area where
you have your tents► any man or woman who has leprosy and anyone who has a
discharge of some fluid from his body, and anyone who has become unacceptable to
God because of having touched a corpse.
3 Send them away from there in order that they will not touch people in the camp
area where I live among you and cause them to become unacceptable to me.’ ”
4 So Moses/I told that to the Israeli people, and the Israeli people obeyed what
Yahweh commanded Moses/me.
Paying for committing crimes
5 Yahweh also told Moses/me,
6 “Tell this to the Israeli people:
‘If someone ◄commits a crime against/ does
something wrong to► another person, I consider that that person has done wrong
to me.
7 That person must confess that he or she is guilty, and he or she must pay to the
person to whom wrong was done what others consider to be a suitable/proper payment
for what he has done, and he must pay an extra 20 percent.
8 If the person against whom the wrong was done has died and there is no relative
to whom the money can be paid, then the money belongs to me, and it must be paid
to the priest. In addition, the one who did the wrong must give a male sheep to the
priest to sacrifice in order that ◄that person’s sin may be forgiven/I can forgive that
person for his sin►.
9 All the sacred offerings that the Israelis bring to the priest belong to the priest.
10 The priest can keep those gifts.’ ”
Suspecting a wife of committing adultery
11 Yahweh also said this to Moses/me:
12 “Tell this to the Israeli people: ‘Suppose a man thinks that his wife has slept with
another man,
13 but neither he nor anyone else knows if it is true or not, because no one saw her
doing that.
14 But if the woman’s husband is jealous, and if he suspects that she has committed
adultery, and he wants to know whether that is true or not,
15 he should take his wife to the priest. He must take along as an offering two quarts/
liters of barley flour. The priest must not pour olive oil or incense on it, because this
is an offering that the man has brought because he ◄is jealous/wants his wife to sleep
only with him►. It is an offering to find out if she is guilty or not. Neither olive oil
NUMBERS 5:16
203
NUMBERS 6:4
nor incense should be used because are associated with joy and this is not a time for
joy.
16 The priest must tell the woman to stand in front of the altar in my presence.
17 He must put some sacred water in a clay jar, and then he must put some dirt
from the floor of the Sacred Tent into the water.
18 He must untie/unfasten the woman’s hair. Then he must put in her hands the
grain that her jealous husband is offering to determine whether she has committed
adultery or not. The priest must hold the bowl that contains bitter water that will
cause ◄the woman to be cursed/bad things to happen to the woman► if she is guilty.
19 The priest must require her to solemnly declare that she will tell the truth. Then
he must say to her, “Has another man had sex [EUP] with you? Have you faithfully
slept only with your husband or not? If you have not slept with another man, nothing
bad will happen to you if you drink the water.
20 But if you have had sex with another man, Yahweh will curse you.
21-22 Your womb will shrivel up and your stomach will swell up. You will never be
able to give birth to children, and as a result, everyone will curse you and avoid you.
If you have committed adultery, when you drink this water, that is what will happen to
you.” Then the woman must answer, “If I am guilty, I will not object if that happens.”
23 ‘Then the priest must write with ink on a small scroll these ◄curses/bad things
24-25 The priest must take from her the offering of barley flour that she is holding,
26 and burn part of it as a sacrifice. Then the woman must drink the bitter water.
27 If the woman has committed adultery, the water will cause her to suffer greatly.
Her stomach will swell up and her womb will shrink, and she will be unable to give
birth to children. And then her ◄relatives/fellow Israelis► will curse her.
28 But if she ◄is innocent/ has not committed adultery►, her body will not be
harmed, and she will still be able to give birth to children.
29 ‘That is the ritual that must be performed when a woman who is married has
been unfaithful to her husband,
30 or when a man is jealous and suspects that his wife has had sex with another
man. The priest must tell that woman to stand at the altar in my presence and obey
these instructions.
31 Even if the woman has not done what the husband suspected, he will not be
punished [MTY] for doing something wrong by bringing his wife to the priest. But if
his wife is guilty, she will suffer as a result.’ ”

Rules about Nazir-men
1 Yahweh also said this to Moses/me:
2 “Tell this to the Israeli people: ‘If any of you wants to make a solemn promise to
dedicate himself to belong to me in a special way, after you obey these instructions,
you will be called a Nazir-man, which means “dedicated man”.
3 You must not drink any wine or other alcoholic/fermented drink. You must not
drink any vinegar made from wine or from any other alcoholic/fermented drink. You
must not drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins.
4 You must not eat anything that comes from grapevines, not even the skins or seeds
of grapes, during the time that you are a Nazir-man.
NUMBERS 6:5

NUMBERS 6:20
5 ‘Even your hair will be dedicated to me during the time that you area Nazir-man,
so you must never allow anyone to cut your hair. Until the time that your solemn
promise to dedicate yourself to me is ended, you must allow your hair to grow long.
6 And you must not go near a corpse during the time that you are a Nazir-man.
7 Even if the person who died is your father or your mother or your brother or your
sister, you must not cause yourself to become unacceptable to me by coming close to
the corpse. Your long hair [MTY] shows that you belong to me in a special way, so
you must not cut your hair.
8 You are required to keep doing this all the time that you are dedicated to me in
this special way.
9 ‘If anyone dies very suddenly when he is near you, then your hair that you have
dedicated to me is no longer sacred. So you must wait seven days and then shave it
all off. Then you must perform a special ritual to cause yourself to become acceptable
10 The next day you must bring two doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the

on the altar, I will forgive you for having come close to a corpse, and when your hair
grows again it will be dedicated to me again.
12 The amount of time that you were set apart for me the previous time does not
count, because you had become unacceptable to me by coming close to a corpse during
the time that you were a Nazir-man. So you must again make a solemn promise to
dedicate yourself to me for the entire amount of time that you indicated the previous
time. And you must also sacrifice a one-year-old lamb for not doing what you were
required to do.
13 ‘When the time that you promised to dedicate yourself to me is ended, go to the
entrance of the Sacred Tent
14 and offer as sacrifices to me three animals that have no defects: Offer a one-yearold ram that will be burned completely, a one-year-old female lamb as a sacrifice to
enable me to forgive your sins, and one full-grown ram as a sacrifice to maintain
fellowship with me.
15 ‘When you bring those animals, you must also bring some wine to offer as a
sacrifice. And you must also bring a basket of bread that you have made with very
good flour and olive oil. But you must not put any yeast in the bread. Also brush/
spread some olive oil on some thin wafers and bring them to the priest.
16 ‘The priest will put the young lamb and the young ram on the altar and

and he will also burn on the altar some of the bread and the grain and wine.
18 ‘After that, you must stand at the entrance of the Sacred Tent and shave off your
hair. Then you must put that hair in the fire that is under the animal that has been
sacrificed on the altar to maintain fellowship with me.
19 ‘The meat from the ram’s shoulder must be boiled. After it is cooked, the priest
will take it along with one of the loaves of bread and one wafer which has been
brushed with olive oil, and he will put them in your hands.
20 Then the priest will take them back and lift them up high to dedicate them to me.
They now belong to the priest, and he is permitted to eat some of the meat from the

ram’s shoulder and from its ribs and from one of its thighs, because that meat is his
share of the sacrifice. After that, you will no longer be a Nazir-man, and you will
again be permitted to drink wine.
21 ‘Those are the regulations about the offerings that Nazir-men solemnly promise
to bring to me to end their time of being dedicated to me. They must bring these
offerings, but if they want to, they may bring additional offerings. And they must
do everything that they solemnly promised to do when they dedicated themselves to
me.’ ”
The blessing for the people
22 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
23 “Tell Aaron and his sons that when they ask me to bless the people, they must
say,
and protect you,
and act kindly toward you,
and cause things to go well for you.’ ”
I will bless them.”

The offerings brought to the Sacred Tent
1 When Moses/I had finished setting up the Sacred Tent, he/I dedicated [MTY] it
to Yahweh. He/I also dedicated the things that are inside the tent, and the altar for
burning sacrifices, and all the things that would be used at the altar.
2 Then the leaders of the twelve Israeli tribes, the same men who had helped Aaron
and Moses/me to count the men who could fight in battles,
3 came to the tent, bringing gifts to Yahweh. They brought six sturdy/large carts
and twelve oxen, one ox from each of the leaders and a cart from each of the two
leaders.
4 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me,
5 “Accept these gifts, in order that the descendants of Levi can use them for carrying
the sacred items that are here at the Sacred Tent.”
6 So Moses/I took the carts and oxen and gave them to the descendants of Levi.
7 He/I gave two carts and four oxen to the descendants of Gershon for their work,
8 and he/I gave four carts and eight oxen to the descendants of Merari for their
work. Aaron’s son Ithamar was the supervisor of all their work.
9 But he/I did not give any carts or oxen to the descendants of Kohath, because they
took care of the sacred items that were to be carried on their shoulders, not on carts.
10 On the day that the altar was dedicated [MTY], the twelve leaders brought other
gifts to be dedicated and put them in front of the altar.
11 Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Each of the next twelve days one leader should bring
his gifts for the dedication of the altar.”
12-83 These are the gifts that each of the leaders brought:
—a silver dish that weighed ◄more than three pounds/1.5 kg.►, and a silver bowl
that weighed ◄almost two pounds/800 grams►, both of which were full of good
flour and mixed with olive oil to be offerings of grain; they both were weighed
using the standard scales;
—a small gold dish that weighed ◄four ounces/14 grams►, filled with incense;
NUMBERS 7:84-88
206
NUMBERS 8:6
—a young bull, a full-grown ram, and a one-year-old ram, to be sacrifices to be
completely burned on the altar;
—a goat to be sacrificed to enable me to forgive the people for the sins they have
committed;
—and two bulls, five full-grown rams, five male goats, and five rams that were
one-year-old, to be sacrifices to maintain the people’s fellowship with Yahweh.
This was the order in which the leaders brought their gifts:
on the first day, Nahshon, son of Amminadab from the tribe of Judah brought his
gifts;
on the next/second day, Nethanel, son of Zuar, from the tribe of Issachar;
on the next/third day, Eliab, son of Helon, from the tribe of Zebulun;
on the next/fourth day, Elizur, son of Shedeur, from the tribe of Reuben;
on the next/fifth day, Shelumiel, son of Jurishhaddai, from the tribe of Simeon;
on the next/sixth day, Eliasaph, son of Deuel, from the tribe of Gad;
on the next/seventh day, Elishama, son of Ammihud, from the tribe of Ephraim;
on the next/eighth day, Gamaliel, son of Pedahzur, from the tribe of Manasseh;
on the next/ninth day, Abidan, son of Gideoni, from the tribe of Benjamin;
on the next/tenth day, Ahiezer, son of Ammishaddai, from the tribe of Dan;
on the next/eleventh day, Pagiel, son of Acran, from the tribe of Asher;
84-88 When the altar was dedicated to Yahweh, those twelve leaders brought these
—twelve silver plates and twelve silver bowls, weighing a total of about ◄60
pounds/27.6 kg.►, each of them being weighed on the scales kept in the Sacred
—twelve gold dishes filled with incense, weighing a total of about ◄three pounds/
1.4 kg.►, each being weighed on those same scales;
—twelve bulls, twelve full-grown rams, and twelve one-year-old rams, to be
sacrifices that were completely burned, along with the grain offerings;
—twelve goats to be sacrificed to forgive the people for the sins they have
committed;
—and 24 bulls, 60 full-grown rams, 60 goats, and 60 rams that were one-year-old,
to be sacrifices to maintain the people’s fellowship with Yahweh.
89 Whenever Moses/I entered the Sacred Tent to talk with Yahweh, he/I heard
Yahweh’s voice speaking between the two images of creatures with wings that were
above the lid of the sacred chest.

2 “Tell Aaron to put the seven lamps on the lampstand and place them in such a
way that they shine toward the front of the lampstand.”
3 So Moses/I told him what Yahweh said, and he did that.
4 The lampstand had been made from gold that had been hammered from one large
lump of gold, from its base to the decorations at the top that resembled flowers. The
lampstand was made exactly like Yahweh had told Moses/me that it should be made.
Instructions for dedicating the descendants of Levi
5 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
6 “You must cause the descendants of Levi to be acceptable to me by setting them
apart from the other Israeli people.

NUMBERS 8:26
7 Do that by sprinkling them with water which will symbolize their being freed/
cleansed from the guilt of their sins. Then they must shave off all the hair on their
bodies and wash their clothes.
8 Then they must bring to the Sacred Tent one bull and some grain mixed with olive
oil. Those things will be burned as sacrifices. They must also bring another bull that

11 Aaron must then present them to me to be a gift from the Israeli people, in order
that they can work for me at the Sacred Tent.
12 “After that, the descendants of Levi must place their hands on the heads of the

13 The descendants of Levi must stand at the altar in front of Aaron and his sons,
14 This ritual will show that the descendants of Levi are set apart from the other
Israelis and that they belong to me.
15 “After the descendants of Levi have been made acceptable to me, and presented
to me like a special offering, they may start to work at the Sacred Tent.
16 They will belong to me. They will work for me as substitutes for the firstborn
males of all the Israelis, who also belong to me.
17 All the firstborn males in Israel, both the people and the animals, are mine. When
I caused all the firstborn sons of the people of Egypt to die, I ◄spared/did not kill►
the firstborn males of the Israelis. I set them apart to belong to me. I said that the
firstborn males of all their domestic animals would also belong to me.
18 But now I have chosen the descendants of Levi to take the places of the firstborn
males of other Israelis.
19 I have appointed the descendants of Levi to help Aaron and his sons at the Sacred
Tent, as Aaron and his sons offer the sacrifices so that the Israeli people’s sins will
be forgiven, and to prevent the Israelis from coming close to the tent with the result
that a plague would cause many of them to become sick and die.”
20 Aaron and Moses/I and the other Israelis helped the descendants of Levi to do
everything that Yahweh had commanded.
21 The descendants of Levi sprinkled themselves with water to symbolize that they
had been freed/cleansed from the guilt of their sins, and they washed their clothes.
Then Aaron brought them to the altar to present them to Yahweh, and he offered
sacrifices to cleanse them from the guilt of their sins and cause them to become
acceptable to Yahweh.
22 After that, the descendants of Levi started to work at the Sacred Tent to assist
Aaron and his sons. They did that just as Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.
23 Yahweh also said this to Moses/me:
24 “The descendants of Levi who are between 25 and 50 years old will work at the
Sacred Tent.
25 But after they become 50 years old, they must ◄retire/not do that work any
more►.
26 They may help the other descendants of Levi to do their work at the Sacred Tent,
but they must not do the work themselves. That is what you must tell them about
the work they will do.”

1 One year after the Israelis left Egypt, during the month of March, while they were
in the Sinai Desert, Yahweh said to Moses/me,
2 “Tell the Israeli people that they must celebrate the Passover Festival again.
3 They must do it on the fourteenth day of this month, early in the evening, and
they must obey all the instructions about it that I gave you previously.”

10 “Tell this to the Israeli people: If any of you or your descendants touch a corpse
trip at the time to celebrate the Passover, you will still be permitted to celebrate it.
11 But you must celebrate it exactly one month later, early in the evening of the
fourteenth day of that month. Eat the meat of the lamb for the Passover Festival with
bread that is baked without yeast and eat bitter herbs.
12 Do not leave any of it until the next morning. And do not break any of the lamb’s
bones. Obey all the regulations about celebrating the Passover.
13 But if any of you has not done anything that would make you unfit to celebrate
the Passover Festival, and you are not away from home on a long trip, and you do
not sacrifice to me at the proper time, you will no longer be allowed to associate with
my people. ◄You will be punished/I will punish you►.
14 Foreigners who live among you may also celebrate the Passover Festival, if they
obey all my commands concerning it.”
A cloud covered the Sacred Tent
15-16 On the day that the Sacred Tent was set up, a cloud covered it. From the time
that the sun set until the time that the sun rose the next day, the cloud resembled a
huge fire. And that is what happened every day that we/the Israelis were in the desert.
17 When the cloud rose up and started to move to a new location, we/they followed
it. When the cloud stopped, we/the Israelis stopped there and set up their tents.
18 We/They traveled when Yahweh, by causing the cloud to move or stop, signaled
to us/them when to move and when to stop. When the cloud stayed over the Sacred
Tent, we/the Israelis stayed at that place.
19 Sometimes the cloud stayed over the tent for a long time, so when that happened,
we/they did not travel.
20 Sometimes the cloud remained over the tent for only a few days. We/The people
stopped and set up our/their tents as Yahweh commanded us/them, and we/they
traveled to a new location when Yahweh commanded us/them to do that.
21 Sometimes the cloud stayed in one place for only one day. When that happened,
when the cloud rose up into the sky the next morning, then we/ they traveled.
Whenever the cloud moved, during the day or during the night, we/they traveled.

up into the sky, we/they started to travel.
23 When Yahweh commanded us/them to stop and set up our/their tents, we/they
did that. When he told us/them to move, we/they moved. We/They did whatever
Yahweh told Moses/me that we/they should do.

The silver trumpets
1 Yahweh also told Moses/me,
2 “Tell someone to make two trumpets by hammering each one from one lump of
silver. Blow the trumpets to summon the people to come together and also to signal
that they must move their tents to a new location.
3 If both trumpets are blown, it means that everyone must gather together at the
entrance of the Sacred Tent.
4 If only one trumpet is blown, it means that only the twelve leaders of the tribes
must gather together.
5 If the trumpets are blown loudly, the tribes that are to the east of the Sacred Tent
should start to travel.
6 When the trumpets are blown loudly the second time, the tribes that are to the
south should start to travel. The loud blasts on the trumpet will signal that they
should start to travel.
7 When you want only to gather the people together, blow the trumpets, but do not
blow them as loudly.
8 “The priests who are descended from Aaron are the ones who should blow the
trumpets. That is a regulation that will never be changed.
9 When you fight against enemies who attack you in your own land, tell the priests
to blow the trumpets loudly. I, Yahweh, your God, will hear that, and I will rescue
you from your enemies.
10 Also tell the priests to blow the trumpets when the people are happy, and at
the festivals each year, and at the times when they celebrate the new moon each
month. Tell them to blow the trumpets when the people bring offerings that will be
completely burned, and when they bring offerings to maintain fellowship with me.
If they do that, it will help you to remember that I, Yahweh your God, will help you.”

27 The group from the tribe of Naphtali went last. Ahira, the son of Enan, was their
leader.
28 That was the order in which the groups of Israeli tribes traveled.
29 One day Moses/I said to his/my brother-in-law Hobab, the son of Reuel from the
Midian people-group, “We are on the way to the place that Yahweh promised to give
to us. Come with us, and we will take good care of you, because Yahweh has promised
to do good things for us Israeli people.”
30 But Hobab replied, “No, I will not go with you. I want to return to my own land
and to my own family.”
31 But Moses/I said, “Please do not leave us. You know the places where we can set
up our tents in this desert, and you can guide us.
32 Come with us. We will share with you all the good things that Yahweh gives to
us.”
33 So Hobab agreed to go with them. The Israelis left Sinai Mountain, which they
called Yahweh’s Mountain, and they walked for three days. The men carrying the
sacred chest went in front of the other people for those three days, and they kept
looking for a place to set up their tents.
35 Each morning when the men who were carrying the sacred chest started to walk,
“Yahweh, arise!
Scatter your enemies!
Cause those who hate you to run away from you!”
36 And each time the men stopped to set down the sacred chest, Moses/I said,
Yahweh sent fire because the people complained
1 One day the people complained to Yahweh about their troubles.
When Yahweh
heard what they were saying, he became angry. So he sent a fire which burned among
the people at the edge of their camp.
NUMBERS 11:2

NUMBERS 11:19
2 Then the people cried out to Moses/me, and he/I prayed to Yahweh. Then the fire
stopped burning.
3 So they called that place Taberah, which means ‘burning’, because the fire from
Yahweh had burned among them.
Seventy leaders were chosen to help Moses
4 Then some troublemakers from other people-groups who were traveling with the
Israelis began to want better food. And when they started complaining the Israeli
people also started to complain.
5 They said, “We wish we had some meat!
6 We remember the fish that we ate while we were in Egypt, fish that was given
to us without ◄cost/asking us to pay for it►. And we had all the cucumbers, melons,
leeks, onions, and garlic that we wanted. But now we do not have any desire to eat,
because all we have to eat is this manna!”
7 The manna resembled small white seeds.
8 Each morning the people would go out and gather some from the surface of the
ground. Then they made flour by grinding it or pounding it with stones. Then they
added water and boiled it in a pot, or they made flat cakes with it and baked them.
The cakes tasted like bread that was baked with olive oil.
9 Each night the manna came down on their ground where their tents were, like
dew from the sky.
10 Moses/I heard all the Israeli people complaining as they were standing in the
entrances of their tents. Yahweh became very angry, and Moses/I was also very
perturbed.
11 He/I went into the Sacred Tent and asked Yahweh, “Why have you caused me,
your servant, to experience this trouble [RHQ]? Act mercifully to me! What wrong
people [RHQ]?
take care of them like a woman carries around her baby and ◄nurses it/gives it her
ancestors [RHQ]?
saying, ‘Give us some meat to eat!’
[MET], and I cannot carry this very heavy load any more.
15 If you intend to act like this toward me, kill me now. If you are really concerned
about me, be kind to me and kill me to end my misery of trying to take care of them!”
16 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Summon 70 men whom you know are leaders
among the Israeli people. Tell them to stand with you in front of the Sacred Tent.
17 I will come down and talk with you there. Then I will take some of the power of
my Spirit that you have, and I will put that power on them also. They will help you
to take care of some of the things that the people are concerned about, in order that
you will not need to do it alone.
18 “Furthermore, say to the people, ‘Make yourselves acceptable to me, and
tomorrow you will have meat to eat. You were complaining, and Yahweh heard you
when you were saying, “We want some meat to eat. We had better food in Egypt!”
Now Yahweh will give you some meat, and you will eat it.
19 You will eat meat not only for one or two days, nor only for five or ten or 20
days.

20 You will eat meat every day for one month, and then you will loathe/despise it,
and it will cause you to want to vomit. This will happen because you have rejected
Yahweh who is here among you, and you have wailed in his presence, saying “We
would have had better food to eat if we had not left Egypt [RHQ].” ’ ”
21 But Moses/I replied to Yahweh, “There are 600,000 men plus women and children
here with me, so ◄why do you say ‘I will give them plenty of meat every day for a
month!’?/it does not seem right for you to say ‘I will give them plenty of meat every
day for a month!’► [RHQ]
22 Even if we killed all the sheep and cattle, that would not [RHQ] be enough to
provide meat for all of them Even if we caught all the fish in the sea and gave it to
them, that would not be enough [RHQ]!”
23 But Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Do you think that I [SYN] have no power? You
will now see if I can do what I say I will do.”
24 So Moses/I went out from the Sacred Tent and told the people what Yahweh had
said. Then he/I gathered together the 70 leaders and told them to stand around the
Sacred Tent.
25 Then Yahweh came down in the cloud that was above the tent and spoke to Moses/
me. He took some of the power of the Spirit that he had given to Moses/me and gave it
to the 70 leaders. By means of the power of the Spirit within them, they ◄prophesied/
spoke messages that Yahweh gave them►, but they did that only once.
26 Two of the leaders whom Moses/I appointed, Eldad and Medad, were not there
when the rest of them gathered together. They had not left their tents to go and stand
around the Sacred Tent. But Yahweh’s Spirit came on them also, and they started to
◄prophesy/speak messages from Yahweh►.
27 So a young man ran and told Moses/me, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in
all their tents!”
28 Joshua, who had helped Moses/me since he was a young man, said, “Sir, tell them
to stop doing that!”
Do you think that I want to be the only one who prophesies► [RHQ]? I wish that
all Yahweh’s people could ◄prophesy/speak messages from Yahweh►. I wish that
Yahweh would give the power of his Spirit to all of them!”
30 Then Moses/I and all the leaders went back to their/our tents.
31 Then Yahweh sent a strong wind from the sea. It blew quail into the area all
around the camp for miles in every direction, and caused the quail to fall onto the
ground. They were piled up on the ground about ◄3 feet/1 meter► high!
32 So the people went out and gathered up the quail all that day, and all that night,
and all of the following day. It seemed as though everyone gathered at least 50 bushels!
They spread the quail out on the ground all around the camp, so that the quail would
dry out.
33 Then they cooked them and started to eat them. But while they were still eating
the meat [MTY], Yahweh showed that he was very angry with them. He struck them
with a severe plague/sickness, and many people died.
34 The people who died and were buried were the ones who had said they wanted
to eat meat like they had formerly eaten in Egypt. So they called that place KibrothHattaavah, which means ‘graves of those who craved’.
35 From there, the Israelis continued walking east until they arrived at Hazeroth
town, where they stopped and stayed for a long time.

Miriam and Aaron were jealous of Moses
1-2 Moses’/My older sister Miriam and his/my older brother Aaron were saying this:
“Is Moses the only one to whom Yahweh has spoken messages to tell to us [RHQ]?
Does Yahweh not speak messages to us two also?” They told people that they were
saying that because Moses/I had married a woman who was a descendant of the Cush
people-group, but they were really saying that because they ◄were jealous/did not want
Moses/me to be the only leader of the Israeli people►. But Yahweh heard what they
were saying.
3 The truth was that Moses/I was very humble. He/I was more humble than anyone
else on the earth and Moses/I had not appointed himself/myself to be their leader.
4 So immediately Yahweh spoke to Moses/me and to Aaron and Miriam. He said,
“All three of you must go and stand at the Sacred Tent.” So they/we did that.
5 Then Yahweh descended to the entrance of the tent in a cloud that resembled a
huge white pillar. He told Aaron and Miriam to step forward, so they did.
6 Then he said to them,
“Listen to me!
When a prophet is among you,
I usually reveal myself to him by allowing him to see visions,
and I speak to him in dreams.
7 But that is not the way I speak to my servant Moses.
I trust that he will lead my people well.
8 So I talk to him face-to-face.
parables.
So you should be afraid to criticize my servant Moses!”
10 When the cloud rose up from the Sacred Tent, Aaron looked at Miriam, and he
saw that her skin was as white as snow, because she now had leprosy.
11 Aaron said to Moses/me, “My master, please do not punish us for this sin that we
have foolishly committed.
12 Do not allow Miriam to be like a baby that is already dead when it is born, whose
flesh is already half decayed!”
13 So Moses/I cried out to Yahweh, saying, “God, I plead with you to heal her!”
14 But Yahweh replied, “If her father had rebuked her for doing something wrong
by spitting in her face, she would have been ashamed for seven days. She should be
ashamed because of what she has done. So send her outside the camp for seven days.
Then she will not have leprosy any more, and she may return to the camp.”
15 So they sent her outside the camp for seven days. ◄The people/We► did not
move to another location until she returned.
16 But after she returned, they/we left Hazeroth and moved north in the Paran Desert
and set up their/our tents there.

Twelve Israeli men explored Canaan
1 Yahweh said to Moses/me,
2 “Send some men to Canaan land to explore it. That is the land that I will give to
you Israelis. Send men who are leaders in their tribes.”
NUMBERS 13:3
214
NUMBERS 13:29
3 So Moses/I did what Yahweh commanded him/me.
He/I sent out twelve Israeli
men who were all leaders of their tribes. He/I sent them from their/our camp at
Paran in the desert.
4 These are the names of the men and the tribes they belonged to:
Shammua, the son of Zaccur, from the tribe of Reuben;
5 Shaphat, the son of Hori, from the tribe of Simeon;
6 Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, from the tribe of Judah;
7 Igal, the son of Joseph, from the tribe of Issachar;
8 Hoshea, the son of Nun, from the tribe of Ephraim;
9 Palti, the son of Raphu, from the tribe of Benjamin;
10 Gaddiel, the son of Sodi, from the tribe of Zebulun;
11 Gaddi, the son of Susi, from the tribe of Manasseh;
12 Ammiel, the son of Gemalli, from the tribe of Dan;
13 Sethur, the son of Michael, from the tribe of Asher;
14 Nahbi, the son of Vophsi, from the tribe of Naphtali;
15 and Geuel, the son of Maki, from the tribe of Gad.
16 Those are the names of the men whom Moses/I sent out to explore Canaan. Before
they left, Moses/I gave Hoshea a new name, Joshua, which means ‘Yahweh is the one
who saves.’

desert in the south all the way to Rehob town near Lebo-Hamath in the north.
22 In the south, they went to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, huge men
descended from Anak, lived. Hebron was a city that was built seven years before Zoan
city was built in Egypt.
23 In one valley, they cut from a grapevine one cluster of grapes. Because it was very
large, they needed two men to carry it on a pole. They also picked some pomegranates
and some figs to carry back to their camp.
24 They called that place Eshcol which means ‘cluster’ because they had cut that
huge cluster of grapes there.
25 After they explored the land for 40 days, they returned to their camp.
The report about Canaan
26 They came to Aaron and Moses/me and the rest of the Israeli people in the desert
at Paran. They reported to everyone what they had seen. They also showed them the
fruit that they had brought back.
27 But this is what they reported to Moses/me: “We arrived in the land that you sent
us to explore. It is truly a beautiful land, and it is very fertile [IDM]. Here is some of
the fruit.
28 But the people who live there are very strong. Their cities are large and are
surrounded by walls. We even saw some of the huge descendants of Anak there.
29 The descendants of Amalek live in the southern part of the land, and the
descendants of Heth, Jebus, and Amor live in the hilly area to the north. The

descendants of Canaan live along the coast of the Mediterranean sea and along the
Jordan River.”
30 When they said that, the people were afraid and started to cry out very loudly. But
Caleb told the people who were standing near Moses/me to be quiet. Then he said,
“We should go there and take the land, because we are certainly able to conquer it!”
31 But the men who had gone with him said, “No, we cannot attack and defeat those
people! They are much stronger than we are!”
explored. They said, “The land that we explored is very large; we cannot conquer it.
33 We even saw the descendants of Nephili there. The descendants of Anak whom
we saw there are descended from the giant Nephili people. When we saw them, we
felt as small as grasshoppers [SIM], and they thought that we looked like grasshoppers
too!”
14
The Israeli people continued to complain
1 That night, all the Israeli people cried loudly.
2 The next day they all complained to Aaron and Moses/me. All the men said, “We
wish that we had died in Egypt, or in this desert!
And our wives and children will be taken away to be slaves. Instead of going to
Canaan. It would be better for us to return to Egypt!”
4 Then some of them said to each other, “We should choose a leader who will take
us back to Egypt!”
5 Then Aaron and Moses/I bowed down to pray in front of all the Israeli people who
had gathered there.
6 Joshua and Caleb, two of the men who had explored the land, tore their clothes
because they were very dismayed.
7 They said to the Israeli people, “The land that we explored is very good.
8 If Yahweh is pleased with us, he will lead us into that very fertile [IDM] land, and
he will give it to us.
9 So do not rebel against Yahweh! And do not be afraid of the people in that land!
We will ◄gobble them up/completely destroy them► [MET]! They do not have anyone
who will protect them, but Yahweh will be with us and help us. So do not be afraid
of them!”
10 Then all the Israeli people talked about killing Caleb and Joshua by throwing
stones at them. But suddenly Yahweh’s glory appeared to them at the Sacred Tent.
11 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “How long will these people reject me [RHQ]?
I am tired of them not believing in what I can do, in spite of all the miracles I have
performed among them [RHQ]!
12 So I will cause a ◄plague/widespread sickness► to strike them and get rid of
them. But I will cause your descendants to become a great nation. They will be a
nation that is much greater and stronger than these people are.”
13 But Moses/I replied to Yahweh, “Please do not do that, because the people of Egypt
will hear about it! You brought these Israeli people from Egypt by your great power,
14 and the people of Egypt will tell that to the descendants of Canaan who live in this
land. Yahweh, they have already heard about you. They know that you have ◄been
with/helped► these people and that they have seen you face-to-face. They have heard
NUMBERS 14:15
216
NUMBERS 14:34
that your cloud is like a huge pillar that stays over them, and by using that cloud you
lead them during the day, and the cloud becomes like a fire at night to give them light.
15 If you kill these people all at one time, the people-groups who have heard about
your power will say,
16 ‘Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land that he promised to give to
them, so he killed them in the desert.’
17 “So Yahweh, now show that you are very powerful. You said,
18 ‘I do not quickly become angry; instead, I love people very much, and I forgive
people for having sinned and having disobeyed my laws. But I will always punish
[LIT] people who are guilty of doing what is wrong. When parents sin, I will punish
them, but I will also punish their children and their grandchildren and their greatgrandchildren and their great-great-grandchildren.’
19 So, because you love people like that, forgive these people for the sins that they
have committed, just like you have continued to forgive them ever since they left
Egypt.”
20 Then Yahweh replied, “I have forgiven them, as you requested me to.
21 But, just as certainly as I live and that people all over the world can see my
◄glory/glorious power►, I solemnly declare this:
22 All these people saw my glory and all the miracles that I performed in Egypt and
in the desert, but they disobeyed me, and many times they tested whether they could
continue to do evil things without my punishing them.
23 Because of that, not one of them will see the land that I promised their ancestors
that I would give to them. No one who rejected me will see that land.
24 But Caleb, who serves me well, is different from the others. He obeys me
completely. So I will bring him into that land that he has already seen, and his
descendants will inherit/possess some of it.
25 So, since the descendants of Amalek and Canaan who are living in the valleys in
Canaan are very strong, when you leave here tomorrow, instead of traveling toward
Canaan, go back along the road through the desert towards the Red Sea.”
Yahweh punished the Israelis
26 Then Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses/me,
27 “How long will the wicked people of this nation keep complaining about me
[RHQ]? I have heard everything that they have grumbled/complained against me.
28 So now tell them this: ‘Just as certainly as I, Yahweh, live, I will do exactly what
you said would happen.
29 I will cause all of you to die here in this desert! Because you grumbled about
me, none of you who are more than 20 years old and who were counted when Moses
counted everyone
30 will enter the land that I solemnly promised to give to you. Only Caleb and Joshua
will enter that land.
31 You said that your children would be taken from you to become slaves, but I will
take them into the land, and they will enjoy living in the land that you ◄rejected/said
that you could not conquer►.
32 But as for you adults, you will die here in this desert.
33 And like shepherds wander around in the desert as they take care of their sheep,
your children will wander around in this desert for 40 years. Because you adults
were not loyal/faithful to me, your children will suffer until you all die in the desert.
34 You will suffer for your sins for 40 years. That will be one year for each of the 40
days that the twelve men explored Canaan land. And I will be like an enemy to you.’
NUMBERS 14:35
217
NUMBERS 15:8
35 This will certainly happen because I, Yahweh, have said it! I will do these things to
every one in this group who conspired against me. They ◄conspired against/decided
together to reject► me here in the desert, and they will all die right here in this
desert!”
36 Then the ten men who had explored Canaan and who had urged the people to
rebel against Yahweh by giving reports that discouraged the people
38 Of the twelve men who had explored Canaan, only Joshua and Caleb remained
39 When Moses/I reported to the Israeli people what Yahweh had said, many of
40 So the people got up early the next morning and started to go toward the hilly
area in Canaan. They said, “We know that we have sinned, but now we are ready to
enter the land that Yahweh promised to give to us.”
41 But Moses/I said, “Yahweh commanded you to return to the desert, so why are
you now disobeying him [RHQ]? It will not ◄succeed/be possible►.
42 Do not try to enter the land now! If you try, your enemies will defeat you, because
Yahweh will not ◄be with/help► you.
43 When you begin to fight the descendants of Amalek and Canaan, they will
slaughter you! Yahweh will abandon you, because you have abandoned him.”
44 But even though Moses/I did not leave the camp, and the sacred chest that
contained the Ten Commandments was not taken from the camp, the people began
to go towards the hilly area in Canaan.
45 Then the descendants of Amalek and Canaan who lived in that hilly area came
down and attacked them and chased them as far south as the town of Hormah.

Instructions about offerings
1 Then Yahweh told Moses/me,
2 “Tell this to the Israeli people:
When you arrive in the land that I am giving to
you,
3 you must offer to me special sacrifices which will be pleasing to me when the
priest burns them on the altar. Some of them may be offerings that will be completely
burned on the altar. Some of them may be to indicate that you have made a solemn
promise to me. Some of them may be offerings that you yourselves have decided to
make. Some of them may be offerings at one of the festivals that you celebrate each
year. These offerings may be taken from your herds of cattle or from your flocks of
sheep and goats.
4 When you give these offerings, you must also bring to me a grain offering of two
quarts/liters of nice flour mixed with one quart/liter of olive oil.
5 When you offer a lamb to be a sacrifice to be completely burned, you must also
pour on the altar one quart/liter of wine.
6 ‘When you offer a ram to be a sacrifice, you must also bring an offering of four
quarts/liters of finely-ground flour mixed with ◄a third of a gallon/1.3 liters► of olive
oil.
7 And also pour on the altar ◄a third of a gallon/1.3 liters► of wine. While they are
being burned, the smell will be very pleasing to me.
8 ‘Sometimes you will offer a young bull to be completely burned on the altar.
Sometimes you will offer a sacrifice to indicate that you have made a solemn promise
to me. Sometimes you will offer a sacrifice to maintain fellowship with me.

NUMBERS 15:27
9 When you offer these sacrifices, you must also offer a grain offering of six quarts/
10 Also pour on the altar two quarts/liters of wine to be an offering. While those
11 Each time someone offers a bull or a ram or a male lamb or a young goat to be
a sacrifice, it must be done that way.
12 You must obey these instructions for each animal that you bring to me for an
offering.
13 ‘All of you people who have been Israelis all of your lives must obey these
regulations when you offer sacrifices that will be pleasing to me when they are
burned on the altar.
14 If any foreigners visit you or live among you, if they also want to bring a sacrifice
that will be pleasing to me when it is burned on the altar, they must obey these same
instructions.
15 I consider that those who have always been Israelis and those who are foreigners
are equal, and so they must all obey the same instructions. All of your descendants
must also continue to obey these instructions.
16 You Israelis and the foreigners who live among you must all obey the same
instructions.”
17 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
18 “Tell these instructions to the Israeli people: Yahweh says this: ‘When you arrive
in the land to which I am taking you,
19 and you eat the crops that are growing there, you must set some of them aside
to be a sacred offering to me.
20 Each year set aside some of the first grain that you gather after you have threshed
it. Bake a loaf of bread from the first flour that you grind and bring it to me to be a
sacred offering.
21 Every year, you and your descendants must continue to make and bring to me a
loaf of bread baked [MTY] with flour from the first part of the grain that you harvest.’ ”
When people sin unintentionally or deliberately
22 “ ‘There may be times when you Israelis do not obey all these instructions that I
have given to Moses to tell you, but not because you intended to disobey them.
23 There may be times when some of your descendants do not obey all these
instructions that I have given to Moses to tell to you.
24 If you or they sin by forgetting to obey these instructions and none of the Israeli
people realize that they were doing that, one young bull as an offering for all the
people must be brought to the priest. That will be pleasing to me when it is burned
and a male goat, to be sacrificed to enable me to forgive them for the sins they have
committed.
25 By offering these sacrifices, the priest will make atonement for all of you Israeli
people. Then, as a result of their bringing to me an offering to be burned on the altar,
◄you will be forgiven/I will forgive you►, because you sinned without realizing that
you were sinning.
26 You Israeli people and the foreigners who are living among you will all be
forgiven.
27 If one person commits a sin without realizing that he was sinning, that person
must bring to me a female goat to be an offering to enable me to forgive that person
for the sins that person has committed.
NUMBERS 15:28
219
NUMBERS 16:5
28 The priest will offer it to be a sacrifice to remove the guilt of that person, and
that person will be forgiven.
29 You Israelis and all the foreigners who live among you must obey these same
instructions.
30 But those who disobey my commands ◄deliberately/because they want to►, both
Israelis and the foreigners who live among you, have sinned against me by doing that.
So ◄they must be expelled/you must expel them► from your camp.
31 They have despised my commands and deliberately disobeyed them, so they must
be punished for their sin by not being allowed to live among you any more.’ ”
A man is punished for working on the Sabbath
32 One day, while the Israelis were in the desert, some of them saw a man who was
gathering firewood on the Sabbath/rest day.
33 Those who saw him doing that brought him to Aaron and Moses/me and the rest
of the Israeli people.
34 They guarded him carefully, because they did not know what to do to punish him.
35 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “The man must be executed. All of you must kill
him by throwing stones at him outside the camp.”
36 So they all took the man outside the camp and killed him by throwing stones at
him, as Yahweh had commanded Moses/me that they should do.
Putting tassels on clothing
37 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
38 “Tell this to the Israeli people: You and all your descendants must twist threads
together to make tassels, and then attach them with blue cords to the bottom edges
of your clothes.
39 When you look at the tassels, you will remember all the instructions that I gave
to you, and you will obey them, instead of doing what you desire and as a result
causing yourselves to become unacceptable to me.
40 Seeing those tassels will help you to remember that you must obey all my
commands and that you must be ◄my holy people/dedicated to me►.
41 Do not forget that I am Yahweh, your God. I am the one who brought you out of
Egypt in order that you might belong to me. I am Yahweh, your God.”

Several men rebelled against Moses
the son of Peleth. Those three men were from the tribe of Reuben.
among the Israeli people to join them in rebelling against Moses/me.
3 They came together to criticize Aaron and Moses/me. They said to them/us, “You
two are using more authority than you should! Yahweh has set apart all of us Israeli
people, and he is with/helping all of us. So why do you act as though you are more
important than the rest of us people who belong to Yahweh [RHQ]?”
4 When Moses/I heard what they were saying, he/I prostrated himself/myself on the
ground.
5 Then he/I said to Korah and those Israeli leaders who were with Korah, “Tomorrow
morning Yahweh will show us whom he has chosen to be his priest, and who is holy
and allowed to come near to him. Yahweh will permit only those whom he chooses
to come into his presence.
NUMBERS 16:6
220
NUMBERS 16:25
6 So Korah, tomorrow you and those who are with you must prepare your pans to
burn incense.
7 Then you must light a fire in them and burn the incense in the presence of Yahweh.
Then we will see which one of us Yahweh has chosen to be his holy servant. It is you
men who are descendants of Levi who are trying to use more authority than you
should!”
8 Then Moses/I spoke again to Korah. He/I said, “You men who are descendants of
Levi, listen to me!
9 The God of us Israelis has chosen all of you to be close to him in order that you
can work for him at his Sacred Tent and serve the people. ◄Is that unimportant/Does
that mean nothing► to you [RHQ]?
10 Yahweh has brought you, Korah, and your fellow descendants of Levi, near to
himself. Now are you demanding to become priests also?
11 It is really Yahweh against whom you and your fellow descendants of Levi are
rebelling. Aaron is not the one about whom you are really complaining [RHQ].”
12 Then Moses/I summoned Dathan and Abiram, but they refused to come. They sent
a message saying, “We will not come to you!
13 You brought us out of Egypt, which was a very fertile [IDM] land, in order to
cause us to die here in this desert. That was bad. But now you are also trying to boss
us [RHQ], and that is worse.
14 You have not given us a new land to live in, a land that has good fields and
vineyards. You are only trying to [RHQ] trick these people. So we will not come to
you.”
15 Then Moses/I became very angry. He/I said to Yahweh, “Do not accept the grain
offerings that they have brought. I have not taken anything from them, not even one
donkey, and I have never done anything wrong to them, so they have no reason to
complain about me.”
16 Then Moses/I said to Korah, “You and all those who are with you must come here
tomorrow and stand in front of Yahweh. Aaron will also be here.
17 You and all the 250 men who are with you must each take a pan in which to burn
incense, and put incense in it, to burn it to be an offering to Yahweh. Aaron will do
the same thing.”
18 So the next day each of those men got a pan to burn incense. They put in it
Tent with Aaron and Moses/me.
19 Then Korah summoned all the people who supported him and who were against
Moses/me, and they also gathered at the entrance of the tent. Then the glory of
Yahweh appeared to all of them/us,
20 and Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses/me,
21 “Get away from all these people, in order that I can get rid of them immediately!”
22 But Aaron and Moses/ I prostrated themselves/ ourselves on the ground. We
pleaded with Yahweh, saying, “God, you are the one who caused all these people
to live [MTY]. Only one of these men has sinned; so, ◄is it right for you to be angry
with all the people?/it is not right for you to be angry with all the people!► [RHQ]”
24 “Okay, but tell all the people to get away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and
25 So Moses/I stood up and went to the tents of Dathan and Abiram. The Israeli
221
NUMBERS 16:45
26 He/I told the people, “Get away from the tents of these wicked men, and do not
touch anything that belongs to them! If you touch anything, you will die because of
their sins!”
27 So all the people moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
Dathan and Abiram came out of their tents with their wives and children and babies,
and stood at the entrances of their tents.
28 Then Moses/I said, “I was not the one who decided to do all these things that I
have done. It was Yahweh who chose me and sent me to do them. And now he will
prove that to you.
29 If these men die in a normal way, then it will be clear that Yahweh did not choose
me.
30 But if Yahweh does something that has never happened before, if he causes the
ground that is under their feet to open up and swallow these men and their families
and all their possessions, and they fall into the opening and are buried while they
are still alive, then you will know that these men have insulted Yahweh.”
31 As soon as Moses/I said this, the ground split open beneath those men.
32 It swallowed them and their families and all those who were standing there with
Korah and all of their possessions.
33 They fell into the opening in the ground while they were still alive, and all their
possessions fell into the opening also. They disappeared, and the ground closed back
up again.
34 They screamed as they fell, and all the people who were standing nearby heard
them scream. The people were terrified and cried out as they ran away, saying, “We
do not want the ground to swallow us also!”
35 And then a fire from Yahweh came down from the sky and burned up the 250
men who were burning the incense!
36 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me,
37 “Tell Aaron’s son Eleazar to take the pans that had incense in them away from
the fire and to scatter the burning coals. The pans that those men were carrying are
◄holy/dedicated to me► because they burned incense to me in them.
38 Those men have now died because of their sin; so Eleazar must take their pans
and hammer the metal to make it become very thin. He must make a covering for the
altar with that metal. Those pans were used to offer incense to me, so they are ◄holy/
dedicated to me►. What happened to those pans will now warn the Israeli people.”
39 So Eleazar the priest collected the 250 pans for burning incense that had been
used by the men who died in the fire. He hammered the pans very thin to make a
covering for the altar, as Yahweh told Moses/me should be done.
40 That warned the Israeli people that only those who were descendants of Aaron
were permitted to burn incense for an offering to Yahweh. If anyone else did that,
the same thing that happened to Korah and those who were with him would happen
to them.
41 But the following morning, all the Israeli people started to complain against Aaron
and Moses/me, saying “You have killed many people who belonged to Yahweh!”
42 When all the people gathered together to protest about what Aaron and Moses/I
it, and the glory of Yahweh had appeared.
44 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me,
45 “Get away from these people, in order that I can get rid of them immediately
without injuring you two!” But Aaron and Moses/I prostrated themselves/ourselves
on the ground and prayed.
NUMBERS 16:46
222
NUMBERS 18:1
46 Moses/I said to Aaron, “Quickly take another pan and put in it some burning/hot
coals from the altar. Put incense in the pan, and carry it out among the people to
atone for the sins of the people. Yahweh is very angry with them, and I know that a
◄severe plague/bad sickness► has already started among them.”
47 So Aaron did what Moses/I told him. He took the burning incense out among the
people. The plague had already started to strike the people, but Aaron continued to
burn the incense so that God would forgive them for the sins they had committed.
48 He stood between the people who had already died and those who were still
alive, and then the plague stopped.
49 But 14,700 people had already died from that plague/sickness, in addition to the
people who died with Korah.
50 Then after the plague had ended, Aaron and Moses/I returned to the entrance of
the Sacred Tent.

Aaron’s walking stick budded
1 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me,
2 “Tell the Israeli people to bring to you twelve walking sticks.
They should bring
one from each of the leaders of the twelve tribes. You should carve each leader’s
name on his stick.
3 There must be one stick for the leader of each tribe, so you must carve Aaron’s
name on the stick for the tribe of Levi.
4 Put those sticks inside the Sacred Tent, in front of the sacred chest that has in it
the tablets on which the Ten Commandments are written. That is the place where I
always talk with you.
5 Buds will sprout on the stick of the man whom I have chosen to be the priest. When
the people see that, they will stop their constantly complaining about you because they
will realize that you are the one whom I have chosen.”
6 So Moses/I told the people what Yahweh had said. Then each of the twelve Israeli
leaders, including Aaron, brought his walking stick to Moses/me.
7 Moses/I placed the sticks inside the Sacred Tent in front of the sacred chest.
8 The following morning, when he/I went into the tent, he/I saw that Aaron’s
stick, which represented the tribe of Levi, had sprouted, it had produced leaves and
blossoms, and it had also produced almonds that were ripe!
9 Moses/I brought all the sticks out of the Sacred Tent and showed them to the
people. Each of the twelve leaders took back his own stick.
and let it stay there permanently. That will be a warning to people who want to rebel
11 So Moses/I did what Yahweh had commanded.

13 Everyone who comes close to Yahweh’s Sacred Tent dies. Are the rest of us going
to die, also?” [RHQ]

The duties of the priests and Levites
1 Yahweh said to Aaron, “You and your sons and the other members of your father’s
family are the ones ◄who will be punished/whom I will punish► if anything bad

223
NUMBERS 18:17
happens to the things inside the Sacred Tent. But only you and your sons will be
punished if the priests do something bad.
2 Require that those who belong to your tribe, the tribe of Levi, must assist you and
your sons while you perform your work at the Sacred Tent.
3 But while they do that work, they must not go near the sacred items inside the
tent or near the altar. If they do that, they will die, and you will die, too!
4 They may assist you in doing all the work to take care of the Sacred Tent, but no
one else is permitted to come near the place where you are working.
5 “You are the ones who will do the sacred work inside the Sacred Tent and at the
altar. If you obey these instructions, I will not become very angry with the Israeli
people again.
6 I myself have chosen the descendants of Levi from the other Israelis in order that
they may be your special helpers. They are like a gift that I have given you to work
at the Sacred Tent.
7 But it is you and your sons, who are the priests, who must perform all the rituals
concerning the altar and with what happens inside the Very Holy Place. I am giving
to you this work of serving as priests. So anyone else who tries to do that work must
be executed.”
The offerings for the priests and Levites
8 Yahweh also said to Aaron, “I myself have appointed you to take care of all the
sacred offerings that the Israeli people bring to me. I have given all these sacred
offerings to you and to your sons. You and your descendants will get a share of these
offerings permanently.
9 The parts of the offerings that are not completely burned on the altar belong to
you. Those parts of the sacred offerings, including the offerings of grain, the offerings
for sins and for the people to be forgiven for not giving me what they are required
to give, are set apart, and are to be given to you and your sons.
10 You must eat those offerings in a sacred place, near the Sacred Tent. You and all
of the other males in your clan may eat them, but you must consider those offerings
to be holy/dedicated to me.
11 “The priests lift up high the sacred offerings while they are standing in front of
the altar. All of those offerings that the Israelis offer to me belong to you and your
sons and daughters. They will always be your share. All the members of your family
to eat from these offerings.
me—the best olive oil and new wine and grain.
13 All of the first crops that people harvest and bring to me belong to you. Anyone
in your family who has performed the ritual to become acceptable to me is permitted
to eat that food.
14 “Everything in Israel that is set apart to belong to me also belongs to you.
15 The firstborn males, both humans and domestic animals, that are offered to me,
will be yours. But people must buy back their firstborn sons and the firstborn animals
that may not be used for sacrifices.
16 They must buy them back when they are one month old. The price that they
must pay for each one is five pieces of silver. They must weigh the silver on the scales
that are in the Sacred Tent.
17 “But they are not permitted to buy back the firstborn cattle or sheep or goats.
They are holy and have been set apart for me. Slaughter them and sprinkle their
NUMBERS 18:18
224
NUMBERS 19:2
blood on the altar. Then completely burn the fat of those animals on the altar to be
an offering to me. The smell as they burn will be very pleasing to me.
18 The meat from those offerings will be yours, just like the breast and right thigh
of animals that are presented to me to maintain fellowship with me as the priest lifts
them up high in front of the altar are yours.
19 Anything that the Israeli people present to me as holy/sacred gifts, I am giving
to you. They are for you and your sons and daughters to eat. They will always be
your share. This is an agreement that I am making with you, an agreement that
will ◄last forever/never be changed►. I am also making this agreement with your
descendants.”
20 Yahweh also said to Aaron, “You priests will not receive any of the land or the
property like the other Israeli people will receive. I am what you will receive.
21 “Then the Israeli people bring to me a tenth of all the crops and of their newborn
animals, I will give that to you descendants of Levi. That will be your payment for
the work you do at the Sacred Tent.
22 The other Israelis must not go near that tent. If they go near it, I will consider
that their doing that is a sin, and they will die for committing that sin.
23 Only the descendants of Levi are permitted to work at the Sacred Tent, and they
will be punished if anything bad happens to it. That is a law that will never be
changed. You descendants of Levi will not receive any land among the other Israeli
people,
24 because I will give you one tenth of all the crops and animals that the Israelis
bring to be offerings to me. That is why I said that you will not receive any land like
the other Israelis will receive.”
25 Yahweh said to Moses/me,
26 “Tell this to the descendants of Levi: ‘When you receive one tenth of all the crops
and animals from the Israeli people, you must give one tenth of all that to me to be a
sacred offering.
27 Just like the other Israelis give one tenth of the grain and wine that they produce,
your sacred offering to me. You must present it to Aaron.
30 “Also, tell this to the descendants of Levi: ‘When you present those best portions
they came from your own grain fields and vineyards.
31 You descendants of Levi and your families are permitted to eat the rest of that
food, and you may eat it wherever you want to, because it is your payment for the
work that you do at the Sacred Tent.
32 If you give to the priests the best portions of what you receive, you will not be
punished by me for accepting one tenth of the gifts that the people bring to me. But
you must consider those gifts to be sacred/holy. If you sin by eating those things
in ways that are contrary to these regulations that I have given to you, you will be
executed.’ ”
19
The ritual for removing the guilt of sin
1 Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses/me,
2 “I am now giving to you another regulation. Tell the Israeli people to bring to you
one reddish-brown cow that has no defects. It must be an animal that ◄has never
been/no one has ever► used for plowing ground.
NUMBERS 19:3
3 Give it to Eleazar, the priest.
225
NUMBERS 19:19
He must take it outside the camp and slaughter it
and drain the blood in a basin.
4 He must dip one of his fingers in the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times
on the ground near the Sacred Tent.
5 Then, while Eleazar watches, the cow must be burned completely—its hide, its
meat, the rest of its blood, and even its dung.
6 Eliezer then must take a stick of cedar wood, a stalk of a plant named hyssop, and
some scarlet/red yarn, and throw them into the fire where the cow is burning.
7 “Then the priest must wash his clothes and bathe. After doing that, he may return
to the camp. But he will be unfit for doing any sacred work until that evening.
8 The man who burns the cow must also wash his clothes and bathe, and he will
also be unacceptable to me until that evening.
9 “Then someone who has not become unacceptable to me must gather up the ashes
of the cow and put them in a ◄sacred place/place that is acceptable to me► outside
the camp. The ashes must be kept there for the people of Israel to use when they mix
it with water for the ritual to remove the guilt of sin.
10 The man who gathers up the ashes of the cow must also wash his clothes, and he
also will be unfit to do any more sacred work until that evening. That is a regulation
that will never be changed. It must be obeyed by you Israeli people and by any
foreigners who live among you.
11 “All those who touch a corpse will be unacceptable to me for seven days.
12 On the third day and on the seventh day after touching a corpse, in order to
become acceptable to me again, they must have sprinkled on them some of that water
for removing the guilt of their sin. If they do not do that on both of those days, they
13 All those who touch a corpse, and do not perform in the correct way the ritual
be permitted to live among the Israeli people. The water to remove the guilt of sin
was not sprinkled on them, so they continue to be unacceptable to me.
14 “There is another ritual that must be performed when someone dies inside a
tent. All those who were inside that tent when that person died or who enter that
tent will be unacceptable to me for seven days.
15 Any jars that are inside that tent that are not covered are not permitted to be
used.
16 If someone who is out in a field touches the corpse of someone who was
murdered, or who died from natural causes, or if someone touches a bone from
some human or touches a grave, that person will be unacceptable to me for seven
days.
17 “For someone like that to become acceptable to me again, some of the ashes from
the cow that was burned must be taken and put in a jar. Then some fresh water must
be poured over the ashes.
18 Then someone who is still acceptable to me must take a stalk of a plant named
hyssop and dip it into the water. Then that person must sprinkle some of the water on
the tent where that person died, on the things that are in the tent, and on the people
who were in the tent. He must also sprinkle some of that water on any person who
touched a human bone or who touched a person who died, or who touched a grave.
19 On the third day and on the seventh day after that, the person who is acceptable
to me must sprinkle some of that water on those who have become unacceptable
to me. On the seventh day, the people who are performing that ritual to become
NUMBERS 19:20
226
NUMBERS 20:13
acceptable to me again must wash their clothes and bathe. If they do that, on that
evening they will become acceptable to me again.
20 “If those who have become unacceptable to me do not become acceptable to me
again by doing this, they will no longer be permitted to live among the Israeli people,
because they have defiled my Sacred Tent. They did not sprinkle on themselves the
water that removes the guilt of their sins, so they remain unacceptable to me.
21 That is a law for the Israeli people that will never be changed. Those who sprinkle
that water on themselves must then wash their clothes. And anyone who touches
that water which removes guilt for sins will remain unacceptable to God until that
evening.
22 “If someone touches a thing or a person that has become unacceptable to me,
that person will remain unacceptable to me until that evening.”

Water flowed from a rock
1 In March/April of the next year, the Israeli people traveled/walked to the Zin
Desert and ◄camped/set up their tents► near Kadesh town. While they/we were
there, Moses’/my older sister Miriam died and was buried there.
2 There was no water for the people to drink there, so they came to Aaron and
Moses/me.
3 They complained and said, “We wish that we had died in front of Yahweh’s Sacred
4 ◄Did you bring us, who are Yahweh’s people, into this desert to die along with
with our livestock!► [RHQ]
there are no figs, no grapes, and no pomegranates here. And there is no water for us
6 Aaron and Moses/I turned away from the people and went to the entrance of
the Sacred Tent and prostrated themselves/ourselves on the ground. Then Yahweh
appeared to them/us with his bright glory,
7 and he said to Moses/me,
8 “You and Aaron must take Aaron’s walking stick with you and gather all the people
together. While the people are watching, command that water will flow out of that
large rock over there. Water for the people will flow from it; all they and all their
livestock will have enough water to drink.”
9 So Moses/I did what Yahweh told him/me to do. He/I took Aaron’s walking stick
from the place in the Sacred Tent where it was kept.
10 Then Aaron and he/I summoned all the people to gather at the rock. Then Moses/
I shouted to them, “All you rebellious people, listen! Is it necessary for us to give you
water from this rock?”
11 Then Moses/I raised his/my hand and instead of speaking to the rock, he/I struck
the rock two times with the walking stick. And water gushed/poured out. So all the
people and their livestock drank all the water that they wanted.
12 But Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses/me, “You did not believe that I could
demonstrate my power to the Israeli people and give them water without your striking
the rock. So you will not lead them into the land that I am giving to them!”
13 Later this place was called Meribah, which means ‘arguing’, because there the
Israeli people argued with Yahweh, and there he showed his power to them by giving
them water.
NUMBERS 20:14

NUMBERS 21:1
The king of Edom refused to allow the Israelis to travel through his country
14 While the people were at Kadesh town, Moses/I sent messengers to the king of
Edom to tell him this:
“Your relatives, the Israeli people, are sending you this message. You know the
many troubles/hardships that have happened to us.
15 You know that our ancestors went down to Egypt. You know that they stayed
there for many years. They suffered because the rulers of Egypt caused them to
become their slaves and to work very hard.
16 “But when they called out to Yahweh, he heard them and sent an angel who
brought them out of Egypt. Now we have set up our tents here at Kadesh, a town
at the border of your land.
17 Please allow us to travel through your country. We will be careful to not walk
through your fields and your vineyards. We will not even drink water from your
wells. As we travel, we will stay on the king’s highway, the main road that goes from
the south to the north, and we will not leave that road until we have crossed the
border of your country in the north.”
18 But the king of Edom refused. He replied, “Stay out of my country! If you try to
enter it, I will send my army to attack you!”
19 The Israeli messengers replied, “If we travel through your country, we will stay
on the main road. If we and any of our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay
for it. We want only to travel through your country. We do not want anything else.”
20 But the king replied, “No! Stay out of our country! We will not allow you to
travel through our land!” Then he sent the strongest soldiers in his army to prevent
the Israelis from entering his country.
21 So, because the king of Edom refused to allow the Israelis to travel through his
country, the Israelis turned and traveled a different way.
Aaron died
22 The Israeli people left Kadesh. They went to Hor Mountain,
23 which is at the border of Edom. While they were there, Yahweh said to Aaron and
Moses/me,
24 “It is time for Aaron to die [EUP]. He will not enter the land that I am giving to
you Israelis, because the two of you disobeyed me when I told you to speak to the rock
to cause the water to flow at Meribah.
25 Now you, Moses, take Aaron and his son Eleazar up on Hor Mountain.
26 There you must remove Aaron’s robes that he wears when he does the work of a
priest, and put them on his son, Eleazar. Aaron will die up there.”
27 So Moses/I did what Yahweh commanded. The three of them/us climbed up Hor
Mountain, while all the Israeli people watched.
28 At the top of the mountain, Moses/I took off the robes that Aaron wore while he
did the work of a priest and put them on Eleazar. Then Aaron died there on the top
of the mountain, and Eleazar and Moses/I went back down.
29 When the Israeli people realized that Aaron had died, they all mourned for him
for 30 days.

The Israelis defeated the Canaan people
1 The king of Arad city lived in the area where the Canaan people-group lived, in
the desert in the southern part of the land. He heard a report that the Israelis were
approaching on the road to Atharim village. So his army attacked the Israelis and
captured some of them.
NUMBERS 21:2
“Yahweh, if you will help us to defeat these
people, we will completely destroy all their towns.”
3 Yahweh heard what they requested, and he enabled them to defeat the army of
the Canaan people-group. The Israeli soldiers killed all the people and destroyed
their towns. Ever since that time, that place has been called Hormah which means
‘destruction’.
The bronze snake
4 Then the Israelis left Hor Mountain and traveled on the road towards the Red Sea,
in order to go around the land of Edom. But the people became impatient along the
way,
5 and they began to grumble/complain against God and against Moses/me. They
said, “Why have you brought us out of Egypt to die here in this desert [RHQ]? There
is nothing to eat here, and nothing to drink. And we detest this lousy manna food!”
6 So Yahweh sent poisonous snakes among them. Many of the people were bitten
by the snakes and died.
7 Then the people came to Moses/me and cried out, saying, “We now know that we
have sinned against Yahweh and against you. Pray to Yahweh, asking that he will
take away the snakes!” So Moses/I prayed for the people.
8 Then Yahweh told him/me, “Make a model/image of a poisonous snake, and attach
it to the top of a pole. If those who are bitten by the snakes look at that model, they
will ◄recover/get well►.”
9 So Moses/ I made a snake from bronze and attached it to the top of a pole.
Then, when those who had been bitten by a snake looked at the bronze snake, they
recovered!
The Israelis traveled to Moab
10 Then the Israelis traveled to Oboth and ◄camped/set up their tents► there.
11 Then they left there, and went to Iye-Abarim, in the desert on the eastern border
of Moab.
12 From there they traveled to the valley where the Zered riverbed is, and camped
there.
13 Then they traveled to the north side of the Arnon River. That area is in the desert
next to the land where the Amor people-group lived. The Arnon River is the boundary
between Moab and where the Amor people-group lived.
14 That is why in the book called ‘The Book of the Wars of Yahweh’ it tells about
and the Arnon River
which extend as far as Ar village on the border of Moab.”
previously had said to Moses/me, “Gather the people together, and I will give them
water.”
17 There the Israelis sang this song:
“O well, give us water!
Sing about this well!
18 Sing about this well
which our leaders dug;
they dug out the dirt with their royal scepters and their walking sticks.”
Then the Israelis left that desert and went through Mattanah,
19 Nahaliel, and Bamoth villages.
20 Then they went to the valley in Moab where Pisgah Mountain rises above the desert.

The Israelis defeated kings Sihon and Og
21 Then the Israelis sent messengers to Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group.
This was the message that they/we gave him:
22 “Allow us to travel through your country. We will stay on the king’s highway,
the main road that goes from the south to the north, until we have finished traveling
through your land. We will not walk through any field or vineyard, or drink water
from your wells.”
23 But King Sihon refused. He would not allow them to walk through his land.
Instead, he sent his whole army to attack the Israelis in the desert. They attacked the
Israelis at Jahaz village.
24 But the Israelis completely defeated them and occupied their land, from the
Arnon River in the south to the Jabbok River in the north. They stopped at the border
of the land where the Ammon people-group lived, because the Ammon army was
defending the border strongly.
25 So the Israelis occupied all the cities and towns where the Amor people-group
lived, and some of the Israelis began to live in them. They occupied Heshbon city and
the nearby villages.
26 Heshbon was the capital of the country. It was the city where King Sihon ruled.
His army had previously defeated the army of the king of Moab, and then his people
had begun to live in all of the land of Moab as far as the Arnon River in the south.
27 For that reason, one of the poets wrote long ago,
“Come to Heshbon, the city where King Sihon ruled.
We want the city to be restored/rebuilt.
28 A fire blazed from Heshbon;
it burned down Ar city in Moab,
it destroyed everything on the hills along the Arnon River.
You people who worship your god Chemosh have been ◄annihilated/wiped out►!
The men who worshiped [MET] Chemosh have run away and are now refugees,
and the women who worshiped him have been captured by the army of Sihon, the
king of the Amor people-group.
30 But we have defeated Sihon and those descendants of Amor,
all the way from Heshbon in the north to Dibon city in the south.
We have completely obliterated/destroyed them as far as Nophah and Medeba towns.”
31 So the Israeli people began to live in the land where the Amor people-group lived.
32 After Moses/I sent some men to explore the area near Jazer city, Israeli people
lived there.
his army attacked them at Edrei town.

35 And that is what happened. We Israelis defeated Og’s army, and killed King Og
and his sons and all his people. Not a person survived! And then we Israelis began
to live in their land.

King Balak summoned Balaam
NUMBERS 22:1
230
NUMBERS 22:19
1 Then the Israelis traveled west to the area of Moab that was in the valley of the
Jordan River, across the river from Jericho city.
2 But King Balak, the son of Zippor, who ruled Moab, found out what the Israelis
had done to the Amor people-group.
3 When he saw that the Israelis were very numerous, he and his people became
terrified.
4 So the king of Moab went to the leaders of the Midian people-group and said to
them, “This huge group of Israelis will ◄wipe out/destroy► everything around them,
like an ox devours grass!”
Balak was the king of Moab.
5 He sent messengers to a prophet named Balaam, who was living in his own area,
in Pethor town, near the Euphrates River. He sent this message to request that Balaam
would come to help him:
“A huge group of people has arrived here from Egypt. It looks like they are
covering the entire land! And they have begun to live close to us.
6 Because they are very powerful/numerous, we are afraid of them. So please
come and curse them for me. Then my army may be able to defeat them and expel
them from the land where they are now living. I know that good things will happen
to the people whom you bless, and disasters will happen to the people whom you
curse.”
7 Balak’s messengers, who were leaders of both the Moab and Midian people-groups,
took money with them to pay Balaam in order that he would come and curse the
Israelis. They went to Balaam and told him what Balak had said.
8 Balaam said, “Stay here tonight. Tomorrow morning I will tell you whatever
Yahweh tells me that I should say to you.”
So the leaders from Moab stayed there that night.
9 During the night, God appeared to Balaam and asked him, “◄Who are/Tell me
about► these men who are staying with you.”
10 Balaam replied, “Balak, the king of Moab, sent these men to tell me this:
11 ‘A huge group of people has come from Egypt, and they have spread all over this
area. Please come immediately to curse them. Then I may be able to defeat them and
expel them from this area.’ ”
12 God replied to Balaam, “Do not go with them! I have blessed those people, so
you must not curse them!”
by yourselves, because Yahweh is not allowing me to go with you.”
refused to come with us.”
and they were more important than the men in the first group.
16 They went to Balaam and told him this:
“This is what King Balak says: ‘Please do not allow anything to hinder you from
coming here.
17 I will pay you ◄a lot of money/very well► if you come, and I will do anything
that you ask me to do. Just come and curse these Israeli people for me!’ ”
18 But Balaam answered them, “Even if Balak would give me a palace filled with
silver and gold, I would not do anything to disobey Yahweh, ◄my God/the God whom
I worship►.
19 But stay here one more night, like the other messengers did, and I will find out
if Yahweh has anything more to say to me.”
NUMBERS 22:20
231
NUMBERS 22:37
20 That night God appeared to Balaam again and said to him, “These men have
come to request that you go back with them, so you may go with them, but do only
what I tell you to do!”
Balaam’s donkey spoke to warn him
21 So the next morning, Balaam put a saddle on his donkey and he departed with
two of his servants along with the men from Moab.
22 Even though God had given Balaam permission to go, he was still angry. So he
sent one of his angels to Balaam. This angel stood in the road to block Balaam’s path.
As Balaam and the two servants were riding on their donkeys,
23 Balaam’s donkey saw the angel. The angel was standing in the road and was
holding a sword in his hand, but Balaam did not see him.
Balaam’s donkey turned off the road into a field. So Balaam struck the donkey and
forced it to go back onto the road.
24 Then the angel stood in a place where the road was very narrow, between two
vineyards, with walls on each side of the road.
25 When the donkey saw the angel standing there, it walked very close to the wall
to try to get past the angel. As a result, it bashed Balaam’s foot against the wall. So
Balaam struck the donkey again.
26 Then the angel went further along the road and stood at a place that was
extremely narrow, with the result that the donkey could not get past at all.
27 This time, when the donkey saw the angel, it lay down on the ground with Balaam
sitting on top of it. Balaam became extremely angry, and he struck the donkey again
with his walking stick.
28 Then Yahweh enabled the donkey to speak! It said to Balaam, “What bad thing
have I done to you that caused you to strike me three times?”
29 Balaam shouted, “I struck you because you have caused me to appear to be
foolish! If I had a sword with me, I would kill you!”
always ridden! Have I ever done anything like this previously?”
31 Then Yahweh enabled Balaam to see the angel standing on the road, holding a
the ground in front of the angel.
32 The angel asked him, ‘◄Why did you strike your donkey three times?/ You should
certainly not have struck the donkey three times! [RHQ] I have come to block your
path because what you are planning to do is wrong.
33 Three times your donkey saw me and turned away from me. If it had not done
that, I would certainly have killed you already, but I would have allowed the donkey

34 Then Balaam said to the angel, “I have sinned. But I did not realize that you were
standing there, trying to block my path. So if you do not want me to continue going,
I will return home.”
35 But the angel replied, “I will allow you to go with these men, but you must say

town alongside the Arnon River that was at the border of his own land.
37 When he arrived where Balaam was, he said to him, “I sent you [RHQ] a message
saying that you should come immediately [RHQ]! Why did you not come immediately?
Did you think that I was not able to pay you a lot of money for coming?”

NUMBERS 23:12
38 Balaam replied, “I have come here now, but I am not able to say anything that I
want to. I will say only the words that God tells me to say [MTY].”
39 Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath-Huzoth town.
40 There Balak killed some cattle and sheep as sacrifices, and offered parts of the
meat to Balaam and the leaders who were with him.
41 They slept there, and the next morning Balak took Balaam part way up the
mountain to Bamoth-Baal village. From there, they could see some of the Israeli
people who were down below.
Balaam blessed the Israeli people
23
1 Balaam said to King Balak, “Build seven altars for me here. Then kill seven young
bulls and seven rams for a sacrifice.”
2 So Balak did that. And then he and Balaam each burned a young bull and a ram
as a sacrifice on each altar.
3 Then Balaam said to Balak, “You stand here close to your burned offerings, and I
will go and ask Yahweh if he has something else to tell me. Then I will tell you what
he says to me.”
Then Balaam went by himself to the top of a hill,
4 and God appeared to him there. Balaam said to him, “We have built seven altars,
and I have killed and burned a young bull and a ram as a sacrifice to you on each
altar.”
5 Then Yahweh gave Balaam a message to give to King Balak. Then he said, “Go
6 When Balaam returned to Balak, Balak was standing with the leaders from Moab
7 This is the message that Balaam told them:
“Balak, the King of Moab, summoned me to come here from Syria;
he brought me here from the hills at the eastern side of Syria.
He said, ‘Come and curse the descendants of Jacob for me,
saying that bad things will happen to these Israeli people!’
8 But ◄how can I curse people whom God has not cursed?/I certainly cannot curse
people whom God has not cursed!► [RHQ]
◄How can I condemn people whom Yahweh has not condemned?/I cannot condemn
people whom Yahweh has not condemned!► [RHQ]
9 I have seen them from the tops of the rocky peaks.
I see that they are a group of people who live by themselves;
they have separated themselves from other nations.
10 ◄Who can count the descendants of Jacob; they are as numerous as particles of
<dust/dirt>?/No one can count the descendants of Jacob; they are as numerous
as particles of <dust/dirt>!► [RHQ]
◄Who can count even a quarter of the Israeli people?/No one can count even a quarter
of the Israeli people!► [RHQ]
I wish/hope that I will die like righteous people die;
I hope that I will die peacefully like they will die.”
11 Then Balak said, “What have you done to me [RHQ]? I brought you here to curse
my enemies, but instead you have ◄blessed them/asked Yahweh to bless them►!”
12 But Balaam replied, “I can [RHQ] say only what Yahweh tells me to say. I cannot
say anything else.”
Balaam prophesied about the Israelis again
NUMBERS 23:13
233
NUMBERS 23:30
13 Then King Balak told Balaam, “Come with me to another place.
There you will
see only part of the Israeli people, and you will be able to curse those people for me.”
14 So Balak took Balaam to a field on the top of Pisgah Mountain. There, again he
built seven altars and offered a young bull and a ram as a sacrifice on each altar.
15 Then Balaam said to the king, “Stand here close to your burned offerings, while
I go and talk with Yahweh.”
16 So Balaam did that, and Yahweh appeared to Balaam again and gave him another
message. Then he said, “Go back to Balak and tell him that message.”
17 So Balaam returned to where the king and the leaders from Moab were standing,
next to the altar where Balak had burned the sacrifices. Balak asked him, “What did
Yahweh say?”
18 Then Balaam told him this message:
“Balak, listen carefully;
hear what I have to say, you son of Zippor [DOU]!
19 God is not a human being.
Humans lie, but God never lies.
Whatever he has said that he will do, he does.
So he has blessed them, and I cannot change that.
they have declared that he is their true king.
So the descendants of Jacob will not be harmed;
they will not have any troubles [DOU].
22 God brought them out of Egypt where they were slaves;
he is as strong as a wild ox.
23 When people curse [PRS] the descendants of Jacob, they will not be harmed;
when people work sorcery on them, it will have no power.
So now people will say about the descendants of Jacob,
‘God has done wonderful things for the Israelis!’
24 They are very strong, like lionesses that are ready to attack other animals;
they stand firm like lions.
The lions refuse to rest until they have killed and eaten their prey,
and drunk the blood of the animals they slaughtered.”
25 Then Balak said to Balaam, “If you will not curse them, then I certainly do not
want you to bless them!”
26 But Balaam replied, “I told you that I must do only what Yahweh tells me to do!”
Balaam prophesied about the Israelis a third time
27 Then King Balak said to Balaam, “Come with me; I will take you to another place.
Perhaps it will please God to allow you to curse them from that place.”
28 So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor Mountain where they could look down
and see the Israelis in the desert.
29 Balaam again told Balak, “Build me seven altars again and kill seven young bulls
and seven rams for a sacrifice.”
30 So Balak did what Balaam told him to do. He burned a young bull and a ram on
each altar as sacrifices.

NUMBERS 24:14
24
1 Balaam now realized that Yahweh wanted to bless the Israeli people, not curse
them. So he did not use magic/divination like a shaman would do to find out what
Yahweh wanted, as he often did. Instead, he turned toward the desert.
2 He saw the Israeli people camped there in their tents, with each tribe gathered in
its own group. Then the Spirit of God took control of him,
3 and enabled him to give this prophetic message to Balak:
“I, Balaam, the son of Beor, am giving this prophecy;
I am speaking as a man who sees what will happen in the future clearly speaks.
4 I hear this message from God;
I see a vision from him who is all-powerful.
My eyes are open as I prostrate myself in front of him.
like gardens alongside a river.
They are like strong aloe trees/plants that Yahweh has planted,
like strong cedar trees that grow along the rivers.
7 Your water buckets will always be full;
the seeds that you plant will always have plenty of water to make them grow.
the kingdom that he rules will be honored.
8 God brought the Israelis out of Egypt,
leading them along with his great power [MTY] like a wild ox has.
He devastates all the nations that oppose him;
he breaks all those people’s bones into pieces,
and shoots them with his arrows.
9 The Israelis are like lions that crouch and lie down, ready to pounce on their prey
[SIM].
They are like lionesses that are resting, but ready to attack;
no one [RHQ] would dare to arouse them!
God will bless everyone who blesses you Israelis,
and he will curse everyone who curses you.”
10 Then King Balak was extremely angry with Balaam. He showed with his hands
that he was very angry, and he shouted at Balaam, “I summoned you here to curse
11 So now, get out of here! Go back home! I said that I would pay you a lot of money
12 Balaam said to Balak, “Do you not remember what [RHQ] I told the messengers
that you sent to me? I said,
13 ‘Even if Balak would give me a palace filled with silver and gold, I would not
disobey Yahweh. I cannot do anything bad or anything that is good that he does not
approve of.’ And I told you that I could say only what Yahweh says to me.
14 So yes, I will return to my people, but first, allow me to tell you what will happen
to you Moab people in the future.”
Balaam prophesied a fourth time
NUMBERS 24:15
235
NUMBERS 25:3
15 So Balaam said this to Balak:
“I, Balaam, son of Beor, am again giving a prophecy,
speaking as a man who sees what will happen in the future clearly speaks.
16 I hear a message from God;
I know things that God, who lives in heaven, has revealed to me.
I see a vision from him who is all-powerful.
My eyes are open as I prostrate myself in front of him.
A man who is a descendant of Jacob will appear like a star [MET];
He will crush the heads of you people of Moab;
18 The Israelis will occupy Edom,
and they will conquer their enemies who live near Seir Mountain.
The Israeli people will be victorious/strong.
19 A ruler who is a descendant of Jacob will come;
he will get rid of the people who still live in the city where Balaam first met Balak.”
Balaam’s final prophecies
20 Then Balaam looked out over where the Amalek people-group lived,
and he
prophesied this:
“The Amalek people-group were the greatest nation,
but they will be wiped out.”
21 Then he looked out over the area where the Ken people-group lived, and he
prophesied this:
“You think that the place where you live is secure/safe
like a nest that is made in the cliffs [MET],
22 but you will be wiped out
when the army of Assyria conquers you.”
23 Balaam ended his prophecies by saying,
“Also, ◄who can <survive/escape> when God does all these things?/no one will be
able to <survive/escape> when God does all these things!► [RHQ]
24 Ships will come from Cyprus Island,
and the men in those ships will defeat the armies of Assyria and Eber.
But God will get rid of those men, too.”
25 Then Balaam and Balak returned to their homes.
25
The Israelis worshiped Baal
1 While the Israelis were camped at a place called Acacia Grove, some of the men
caused themselves to become unacceptable to God by having sex with some of the
women of the Moab people-group who lived in that area.
2 Then those women invited the men to come when the sacrifices were being offered
to their gods. The Israeli men accepted. They went to the feasts with the women and
worshiped the gods of the Moab people-group.
3 By doing that, those Israeli people joined the women in worshiping the god
Baal add who the Moab people-group thought lived on Peor Mountain. That caused
Yahweh to become very angry with his people.
NUMBERS 25:4
236
NUMBERS 26:8
4 Yahweh said this to Moses/me: “Seize all the leaders of those men who are doing
this and execute them while I am watching. Do that in the daytime. After you do
that, I will no longer be angry with the Israeli people.”
5 So Moses/I said to the other Israeli leaders, “Each of you must execute your men
who have joined others in worshiping Baal.”
6 But later, while Moses/I and many [HYP] other people were crying at the entrance
of the Sacred Tent, while they/we were watching, one of the Israeli men brought a
woman from the Midian people-group into his tent and started to have sex with her.
7 When Phinehas, who was the grandson of Aaron, saw that, he grabbed a spear
8 and rushed into the man’s tent. He thrust the spear completely through the man’s
body and into the woman’s belly and killed both of them. When he did that, the
◄plague/serious illness► that had started to strike the Israelis stopped.
9 But 24,000 people had already died from that plague.
10 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me,
11 “Phinehas has caused me to stop being angry with the Israeli people, by being
as eager as I am to stop this sinful behavior. I was ready to get rid of all the Israeli
people because I was extremely angry, but Phinehas has prevented me from doing
that.
12 Now tell him that I am making a special peace agreement with him.
13 In this agreement, I am promising to give to him and to his descendants the right/
authority to be priests. I am doing this because he showed that he was very eager to
honor me, his God, by stopping this sinful behavior. He has caused the Israeli people
to become acceptable to me again by causing them to be forgiven for their sin.”
14 The Israeli man who was killed with the woman of the Moab people-group was
named Zimri. He was the son of Salu, who was the leader of a family from the tribe
of Simeon.
15 The woman’s name was Cozbi. She was the daughter of Zur, who was the leader
of one of the clans of the Midian people-group.
16 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me,
17 “Take your men and attack the Midian people-group and kill them.
18 They have become your enemies, because they tricked you Israeli people and
induced/persuaded many of you to worship Baal, and because one of your men had
sex with Cozbi, who was the daughter of a leader of the Midian people-group. She
was killed at the time the plague started because the people sinned at Peor Mountain.”
26
The people were counted again
1 After the plague ended, Yahweh said to Eleazar and Moses/me,
2 “Count all the people of Israel again. Write down the names of all the men who are
at least 20 years old who are able to fight in battles, along with their family names.”
3 So while the Israelis were on the plains where the Moab people-group lived,
Eleazar and Moses/I told this to the Israeli leaders:
4 “Write down the names of all the Israeli men who are at least 20 years old, as
Yahweh has commanded us.”
So they did that, and this is a record of all the descendants of Jacob who came out
of Egypt who were still alive.
5-7 They counted 43,730 men from the tribe of Reuben, Jacob’s oldest son. They were
8 Pallu’s son was Eliab
NUMBERS 26:9
237
NUMBERS 26:58
9 and his grandsons were Nemuel, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram were
the leaders who joined with Korah to conspire against Aaron and Moses/me and
rebelled against Yahweh.
10 But the earth opened up and swallowed them and Korah. Yahweh also sent a fire
that burned up 250 men who supported those three men. That was a warning to
all the Israeli people that they should respect and obey the leaders whom Yahweh
had appointed.
11 But the descendants of Korah did not die on that day.
12-14 The Israeli leaders counted 22,200 men from the tribe of Simeon. They were
in clans descended from Nemuel, Jamin, Jakin, Zerah, and Shaul.
15-18 They counted 40,500 men from the tribe of Gad. They were in clans descended
from Zephon, Haggi, Shuni, Ozni, Eri, Arod, and Areli.
19-22 They counted 76,500 men from the tribe of Judah.
They were in clans
descended from Shelah, Perez, Zerah, Hezron, and Hamul. Judah’s other two
sons, Er and Onan, died in Canaan without having had any children.
23-25 They counted 64,300 men from the tribe of Issachar. They were in clans
descended from Tola, Puvah, Jashub, and Shimron.
26-27 They counted 60,500 men from the tribe of Zebulun. They were in clans
descended from Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
28-34 They counted 52,700 men from the tribe of Manasseh, who was one of the
sons of Joseph. They were in clans descended from Machir, from his son Gilead,
Hepher’s son Zelophehad did not have any sons, but he had five daughters—
35-37 They counted 32,500 men from the tribe of Ephraim, who was Joseph’s
other son. They were in clans descended from Shuthelah, Becher, Tahan, and
Shuthelah’s son Eran.
38-41 They counted 45,600 men from the tribe of Benjamin. They were in clans
descended from Bela, Ashbel, Ahiram, Shephupham, and Hupham, and from
Bela’s two sons—Ard and Naaman.
42-43 They counted 64,400 men from the tribe of Dan. They were in one clan
descended from Shuham.
44-47 They counted 53,400 men from the tribe of Asher. They were in clans descended
from Imnah, Ishvi, and Beriah, and from Beriah’s two sons—Heber and Malkiel.
Asher also had a daughter named Serah.
48-50 They counted 45,400 men from the tribe of Naphtali. They were in clans
descended from Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
51 The total of the Israeli men whom the leaders counted was 601,730.
52 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me,
53 “Divide Canaan land among the tribes. Distribute the land according the number
of people in each tribe that are on your lists.
54-56 Decide by ◄casting lots/throwing stones which are marked► to determine
which group will get which area, but give the largest areas to the groups with the
most people.”
57 The leaders also counted the male descendants of Levi.
They were in clans
descended from Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
58 These also included people from the clans of Libni, Hebron, Mahli, Mushi, and
Korah. All of them were descendants of Levi. Kohath was the ancestor of Amram,
NUMBERS 26:59
238
NUMBERS 27:13
59 whose wife was Jochebed. She also was a descendant of Levi, but she was born
in Egypt. She and Amram had two sons, Aaron and Moses/me, and their/our older
sister Miriam.
60 Aaron’s sons were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
61 But Nadab and Abihu died when they burned incense for a sacrifice to Yahweh
in a way that disobeyed what Yahweh had commanded.
62 The leaders counted 23,000 men from the descendants of Levi who were at least
one month old. But these men were not counted when the rest of the Israeli people
were counted, because they were not given any land.
63 Those were the men whom Eleazar and Moses/I said should be counted. They
counted the Israeli people on the plains where the Moab people-group lived, on the
64 None of the men whom they counted were on the lists that were made by Aaron
and Moses/me when the Israelis were in the Sinai Desert,
65 because Yahweh had said about them, “They will all die in this desert,” and that
is what happened. The only ones who were still alive were Jephunneh’s son Caleb
and Nun’s son Joshua.
27
The request of the daughters of Zelophehad
1 One day the five daughters of Zelophehad came to Moses/me. They were Mahlah,
Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
2 They came to the entrance of the Sacred Tent and stood in front of Eleazar, Moses/
me, the tribal leaders, and many [EUP] other Israeli people.
3 They said, “Our father died during the time that we were in the desert, and he did
not have any sons. But he was not among those who supported Korah, who rebelled
against Yahweh. He died just because he was a sinner like everyone else.
4 ◄Why should the name of his clan disappear with the result that we do not receive
any land only because our father had no sons?/It is not right that the name of his clan
disappear with the result that we do not receive any land only because our father had
no sons.► [RHQ] So give us some land like our relatives will be getting!”
5 So Moses/I asked Yahweh what to do about their request.
6 And Yahweh replied,
7 “What the daughters of Zelophehad are requesting is right. You must give them
some land, just as you are giving to their father’s relatives. Give to each of them some
of the land that would have been given to their brothers if they had any.
8 “Also tell this to the Israeli people: ‘If a man who has no sons dies, give the things
that his sons would have inherited to his daughters.
and daughters would have inherited.
or daughters or brothers would have inherited.
others would have inherited.’ That will be a rule for the Israeli people, because I am
giving this as a command to you, Moses, to tell them.”
Joshua was chosen to be the Israelis’ new leader
12 One day, Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Climb to the top of the Abarim Mountains
east of the Jordan River. Then look out over the land that I am giving to the Israeli
people.
13 After you have seen it, you will die [EUP] just like your older brother Aaron did.
NUMBERS 27:14
239
NUMBERS 28:9
14 The reason that you will die and not enter that land is that you both disobeyed my
instructions/commands in the Zin Desert. When the Israeli people rebelled against
me there at Meribah, near Kadesh, I told you to speak to the rock to cause water to
flow out of it. But because you struck the rock instead of speaking to it, you did not
show the people my holy power.”
15 Then Moses/I said this to Yahweh:
a new leader for the Israeli people.
17 Appoint someone who will lead your people when they go to fight a battle, so
that they will not just wander around like sheep that do not have a shepherd.” [SIM]
18 Yahweh replied, “Get Joshua, the son of Nun, who has my Spirit within him. Lay
your hands on him to appoint him.
19 Cause him to stand in front of Eleazar the priest, as all the people are watching,
and commission/appoint him to be the new leader of the Israeli people.
20 Give to him some of the authority that you now have, in order that all the Israeli
people will know that they must obey him.
21 When you all need me to guide you, Joshua will stand in front of Eleazar. Then
by ◄casting lots/throwing marked stones on the ground► Eleazar will find out what
they should do.”
22 So Moses/I did what Yahweh commanded. He/I presented Joshua to Eleazar and
to all the Israeli people.
23 Moses/I laid his/my hands on him and commissioned/appointed him to do the
work that Yahweh told Moses/me to tell him to do.
28
The daily offerings
1 Yahweh said this to Moses/me:
2 “Tell this to the Israeli people:
Bring to me the offerings that will be burned on
the altar. When they are burned, the smell will be very pleasing to me. And tell them
that they must bring them at the proper/right time.

offerings while you were at Sinai Mountain. When those offerings are burned on the
altar, the smell will be very pleasing to me.
7 When they burn each lamb, they must also pour on the sacred altar one quart/
liter of wine.
8 In the evening, when they offer the second lamb, they must also bring the same
offerings of grain and wine as they burned in the morning. When they are burned,
the smell will also be very pleasing to me.”
The offerings on the Sabbath

12 Also bring with each bull an offering of six quarts/liters of finely-ground flour
mixed with olive oil. With each male sheep make an offering of four quarts of finelyground flour mixed with olive oil.
13 Also bring an offering of two quarts/liters of finely-ground flour mixed with olive

14 With each bull, also bring two quarts/liters of wine. With each male sheep, bring
◄1-1/3 quarts/1.2 liters► of wine. With each lamb, bring one quart/liter of wine. These

On the second day, bring twelve bulls. On the third/next day, bring eleven bulls. One

These animals will be in addition to the offerings of animals and grain and wine that

39 “At your festivals, these are the offerings that you must bring to me: The offerings
that will be completely burned on the altar, the offerings of grain and wine, and the
offerings to maintain fellowship with me. Those are in addition to the offerings that
you give to me because you promised to do something, and other special offerings
that you want to give to me.”
40 Then Moses/I told to the Israeli people all the things that Yahweh had commanded
him/me.
30
Rules about special promises to Yahweh
1 Moses/I spoke with the leaders of the Israeli tribes. He/I told them these commands
that Yahweh had given to him/me:
2 “If a man solemnly promises Yahweh that he will do something, he must do what
he promised.
3 “If a young woman who is still living with her parents solemnly promises to
Yahweh to do something,
4 and if her father hears about what she promised, and if he does not object, she
must do what she promised [DOU].
5 But if her father hears about what she promised and does not allow her to do
that, then she does not need to do what she promised. Yahweh will forgive her for
not doing what she promised.
6 “If a woman promises Yahweh that she will do something, but then she gets
married,
7 if her husband hears about what she promised to do, and he does not object, she
must do what she promised [DOU].
8 But if her husband hears about it and does not allow her to do that, she does not
need to do what she promised, and Yahweh will forgive her for not doing what she
promised.
9 “If a widow or a woman who has been divorced makes a promise, she must do
what she promised.
10 “If a woman who is married promises [DOU] to do something,
NUMBERS 30:11
243
NUMBERS 31:15
11 and if her husband hears about it but does not object, she must do what she
promised.
12 But if he hears about it and does not allow her to do that, she does not need to
do what she promised, and Yahweh will forgive her for not doing it.
13 A woman’s husband may require her to do what she has promised, or he may
not allow her to do what she has promised.
14 If he does not object for several days after he hears about it, she must do what
she promised.
15 But if he waits a long time after she has promised to do something and then he
tells her that he will not permit her to do it, if she does not do what she promised,
she will not be punished; her husband is the one whom Yahweh will punish.”
16 Those are the rules that Yahweh gave to Moses/me for husbands and wives, and
for young women who are still living with their parents.
31
The Israelis attacked the Midian people-group
1 Yahweh spoke to Moses/me and said,
2 “Before you die, tell the Israeli people that they should ◄pay back/get revenge on►
the Midian people-group for what they did to you.”
3 So Moses/I said to the people, “Get some men prepared for battle. Yahweh will
enable them to ◄pay back/get revenge on► the Midian people-group for what they
did to us.
4 Select 1,000 men from each tribe to fight.”
5 So 12,000 men prepared for fighting in the battle, 1,000 from each tribe.
6 When Moses/I sent them to the battle, Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest,
went with them. He took with him some of the things from the Sacred Tent and the
trumpets that would be blown to give the signal to start the battle.
7 The Israeli men fought the soldiers from the Midian people-group, as Yahweh
had told Moses/me to tell them to do, and they killed every man from the Midian
people-group.
8 Among those whom they killed were the five kings of the Midian people-group—
Beor.
away their cattle, their flocks of sheep, and herds of goats, and all their other
10 Then they burned down all the houses in the towns and villages where the people
of the Midian people-group lived,
11 but they took home with them all the women and children and animals and
possessions.
12 They brought all these to Eliezer and Moses/me, and to the rest of the Israeli
people who were at their/our camp on the plains where the Moab people-group lived,
near the Jordan River, across from Jericho.
13 Eleazar and all the leaders of the people and Moses/I went outside the camp to
greet/meet with them.
14 But Moses/I was angry with some of the men who had returned from the battle.
He/I was angry with the army officers and the men who were commanders of 1,000
men and those who were commanders of 100 men.
15 He/I asked them, “Why did you allow the women to live [RHQ]?
NUMBERS 31:16
244
NUMBERS 31:47
16 They are the ones who did what Balaam suggested and urged/persuaded our
people to worship Baal instead of Yahweh. As a result, Yahweh caused a plague to
strike his people while they were at Peor.
17 So, now you must kill all the boys of the Midian people-group, and also kill all
the women who have had sex [EUP] with any man.
18 Spare only the girls who are virgins [EUP]. You can keep them to be your wives
or your slaves.
19 All of you who have killed someone or touched the corpse of someone who was
killed in the battle must stay outside the camp for seven days. On the third day and
on the seventh day, you must perform the ritual to cause you and those whom you
have captured to become acceptable to God again.
20 You must also wash your clothes and anything that you took to the battle that is
made of leather or goat’s hair or wood.”
21 Then Eleazar said to the soldiers who had returned from the battle, “This is what
Yahweh has instructed Moses:
22 You must put into a fire any gold or silver or bronze or iron or tin or lead things
that you brought back from the battle.
23 Put everything that will not burn into the fire, and then they will be acceptable
for you to use. But also sprinkle those things with the water that causes things and
people to become acceptable to God. The things that would burn if you put them in a
fire, sprinkle them with that water.
24 On the seventh day, wash your clothes, and then you will become acceptable to
God again. After you do that, you may return to the camp.”
Dividing the captured goods
25 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
26 “Tell Eleazar and the leaders of the family groups that they must write down a
list of all the goods, the women, and the animals that were captured in the battle.
27 Then they must divide all those things, half given to the men who fought in the
28 From the men who fought in the battle, take one from every 500 people and from
29 Take these things to Eleazar to ◄be my share/belong to me►.
30 And from the half that belongs to the ordinary people, take one item from every
50. That includes people, cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats, and other animals. Give those
things to the descendants of Levi who take care of my Sacred Tent.”
31 So Eleazar and Moses/I did what Yahweh commanded.
32-35 There were 675,000 sheep, 72,000 cattle, 61,000 donkeys, and 32,000 virgins
that they had captured from the Midian people-group.
36 The men who fought in the battle took 337,000 sheep from the battle,
37 and they gave 675 of them to Yahweh.
38 They took 36,000 cattle and gave 72 of them to Yahweh.
39 They took 30,500 donkeys, and they gave 61 of them to Yahweh.
40 They took 16,000 virgins, and they dedicated 32 of them to Yahweh.
41 Moses/I gave to Eleazar all the animals that had been given to Yahweh, as Yahweh
had commanded.
42-46 Moses/I separated what those who had fought in the battle received from what
the other people received. The people had taken 337,500 sheep, 36,000 cattle, 30,500
donkeys, and 16,000 virgins,
47 From what the people received, Moses/ I took one from every 50 items and
dedicated them to Yahweh. That included animals and people. As Yahweh
NUMBERS 31:48
245
NUMBERS 32:14
commanded, he/I gave them all to the descendants of Levi who took care of the
Sacred Tent.
48 Then the army officers and those who commanded 1,000 men and those who
commanded 100 men came to Moses/me.
49 They said, “We, who are your servants, have counted the soldiers whom we
command, and we found that none of them ◄is missing/has been killed►.
50 So to thank Yahweh for that, we have brought to him a gift of the gold items that
we found after the battle: Gold arm bands and bracelets and rings and earrings and
necklaces. This will enable us to be forgiven for our sins.”
51 So Eleazar and Moses/I accepted the gold items that they brought.
52 The total of it weighed about ◄420 pounds/190 kg.►.
53 Each soldier had taken these things for himself.
54 Eleazar and Moses/I accepted these gold items from these commanders and put
them in the Sacred Tent to remind the Israeli people about how Yahweh had helped
them defeat the Midian people-group.
32
The land east of the Jordan River
1 The people of the tribes of Reuben and Gad had much livestock.
They saw that
the land near Jazer city and the Gilead region east of the Jordan River had good grass
for the animals to graze on.
me. They said,
4 Yahweh has enabled us Israelis to capture some land that is very good for animals
Nebo, and Beon towns.
5 If it pleases you, we would like this land to be ours, instead of land on the other
side of the Jordan River.”
6 Moses/I replied to the leaders of the tribes of Gad and Reuben, “It is not right for
[RHQ] your fellow Israelis to go to fight in wars and you stay here!
7 If you do that, you will cause the other Israelis to be discouraged, with the result
that they will not cross the Jordan River to the land that Yahweh is giving to them
[RHQ].
8 Your ancestors did the same kind of thing. I sent them from Kadesh-Barnea to see
what the land of Canaan was like.
9 They went as far as Eshcol Valley, but when they saw the huge people in the land,
they returned and caused the Israeli people to be discouraged, saying ‘We should not
try to enter the land that Yahweh said that he is giving to us.’
10 So Yahweh became very angry with them, and he solemnly declared this:
11-12 ‘From all the people who came out of Egypt, the only ones who are at least
20 years old who will see the land that I promised to give to Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, are Jephunneh’s son Caleb and Nun’s son Joshua, because they trusted me
completely. None of the other people who came out of Egypt will even see that land,
because they have not completely believed in my power.’
13 So Yahweh was angry with the Israeli people, and as a result he has caused us
to wander in this desert for 40 years. Finally, all the people who had sinned against
Yahweh by refusing to trust him died, one by one.
14 And you are acting like your ancestors did! You sinful Israeli people are going to
cause Yahweh to be more angry with you than he was with our ancestors
NUMBERS 32:15
246
NUMBERS 32:38
15 If you stop trusting him, he will cause you and all your fellow Israelis to stay
longer in the desert, and he will get rid of all of you!”
16 Then the leaders of the tribes of Reuben and Gad said to Moses/me, “First we will
build pens for our animals and build cities for our families here.
17 Then our families will live in strong cities with walls around them, and they will
be safe from the people who live in this land. Then we will get ready to fight battles.
We will help the other Israelis to get land on the other side of the river.
18 We will not return to our homes until every Israeli has received some land.
19 We will not take any land on the west side of the Jordan River; our land will be
here on the east side.”
20 So Moses/I told them, “Okay, I will tell you what you all must do. You must get
ready to fight battles for Yahweh.
21 You all must cross the Jordan River carrying your weapons.
22 After Yahweh helps us to take that land from the people who live there, you will
be permitted to return to your homes. You will have done what you have promised
Yahweh and the Israeli people that you would do, and you may keep this land to be
your own, given to you by Yahweh.
23 “But if you do not do these things, you will be sinning against Yahweh, and he
24 Now you can build cities for your families and pens for your animals, but after
25 The leaders of the tribes of Gad and Reuben replied, “We will do what you have
asked us to do [MTY], because you are our leader.
26 Our wives and children and our cattle and sheep and goats will stay here in the
cities in the Gilead area,
27 but we will prepare to go to battle. We will take our weapons and go across the
Jordan River and fight for Yahweh, just as you, our leader, have said.”
28 So Moses/I gave instructions about them to Eleazar, Joshua, and the leaders of
the Israeli tribes.
29 Moses/I said to them, “If the men from the tribes of Gad and Reuben prepare for
battle and cross the Jordan River with you, in order to do what Yahweh desires and
help you to take that land, give them the Gilead area to belong to them.
30 But if they do not take their weapons and go with you prepared to fight, they will
not receive this land. They will need to accept some land in Canaan, like the rest of
you will do.”
31 The leaders of the tribes of Gad and Reuben replied, “We will do what you have
said and what Yahweh has said.
32 We will cross the river into Canaan land, and we will do what Yahweh desires
and be prepared for battle. But our land will be here on the east side of the Jordan
River.”
33 So Moses/I agreed to give that land to the tribes of Gad and Reuben and to half of
the tribe of Joseph’s son Manasseh. That land was previously the land where Sihon,
the king of the Amor people-group, ruled, and the land where Og, the king of Bashan
region, ruled, including its cities and surrounding land.
34 The people of the tribe of Gad rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,
35 Atroth-Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,
36 Beth-Nimrah, and Beth-Haran cities. Those were cities with strong walls around
them. And they also built pens for their sheep.
37 The people of the tribe of Reuben rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,
38 Nebo, Baal-Meon, and Sibmah cities. When they rebuilt Nebo and Baal-Meon,
they gave new names to those cities.
NUMBERS 32:39
247
NUMBERS 33:19
39 The
descendants of Manasseh’s son Makir went to the Gilead region and
compelled the people of the Amor people-group to leave that area.
40 So Moses/I gave Gilead to the family of Makir, and they started to live there.
41 Jair, who was also a descendant of Manasseh, went and captured the small towns
in that region, and he named them the Towns of Jair.
42 A man named Nobah went and captured Kenath city and the nearby towns, and
then he put his own name to be the new name of that area.

50 While we were there on the plains of the Moab region near the Jordan River,
across from Jericho, Yahweh spoke to Moses/me. He said,
Canaan region,
statues and all their idols made of metal. Wreck all the places where they worship
their idols.
53 Take their land from them and start to live there, because I have given their land
to you for you to own.
54 “Divide up the land by throwing ◄lots/small stones which have been marked► to
decide which group will get which area. Give the larger areas to the groups that have
more people, and give the smaller areas to the groups that have fewer people. Each
tribe will receive its own land.
55 If you do not force the people who live there to leave, they will cause you to have
much trouble. They will be like sharp hooks in your eyes, and like thorns in your
sides. And they will bring trouble to you, in that land where you will be living.
56 And then I will punish you, as I had planned to punish them.”
The boundaries of the land of Canaan
34
1 Yahweh said to Moses/me,
2 “Tell this to the Israeli people: You will soon enter Canaan land, and it will become
yours. These will be the borders of the land:
3 On the south you will receive part of the Zin Desert, near the border of the Edom
region. On the east side, the border will start at the south end of the Dead Sea.
4 It will extend to a little south of the Scorpion Pass, and extend west through the
Zin Desert and south of Kadesh-Barnea. From there it will extend to Hazar Addar
and from there to Azmon.
5 From Azmon it will extend west to the dry riverbed at the border of Egypt and
then to the Mediterranean Sea.
6 The border on the west will be the Mediterranean Sea.
7 The border on the north will start from the Mediterranean Sea and extend east
to Hor Mountain.
8 From there it will extend to Lebo-Hamath and then to Zedad.
9 From there the border will extend to Ziphron, and it will end at Hazar-Enan.
10 The border on the east will start at Hazar-Enan and extend south to Shepham.
11 From there it will extend east of Ain to Riblah and then along the hills that are
east of Galilee Lake.
12 Then the border will extend south along the Jordan River and end at the Dead
Sea.
Those will be the borders around your country.”
13 So Moses/I told all that to the Israeli people. Then he/I said to them, “That is the
land that you will receive. You must throw ◄lots/stones that have been marked► to
decide which area will go to each of the nine and a half tribes, because Yahweh has
commanded that it should be divided among them.
14 The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh have already
received the land in which they will live.
15 They have received land on the east side of the Jordan River, across from Jericho.”
16 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me,
17 “These are the men who will divide the land: First, Eleazar and Joshua.
18 But one leader from each of the twelve tribes will help them divide the land.
19-28 “From the tribe of Judah, appoint Jephunneh’s son Caleb.

From the tribe of Issachar appoint Azzan’s son Paltiel.
From the tribe of Asher appoint Shelomi’s son Ahihud.
From the tribe of Naphtali appoint Ammihud’s son Pedahel.”
29 Yahweh commanded that all those were the men who should divide the Canaan
region among the Israeli people.
35
The towns given to the Levites
1 Yahweh told this to Moses/me while the Israeli people were on the plain in the
Moab region near the Jordan River, across from Jericho:
2 “Tell the Israeli people that from the land that they will receive, they must give to
the descendants of Levi some cities in which they can live. They must also give them
some land around these cities.
3 Those will be for the descendants of Levi to live in, and around the cities will be
land for their cattle and flocks of sheep and goats and other animals.
4 “The land that you give them for their animals must extend out for ◄1,500 feet/
450 meters► from the walls of the cities.
5 Also measure ◄3,000 feet/900 meters► in each direction out from the walls of
each city. That additional land will be land for their animals outside the walls of the
cities.”
The cities of safety
6 “Six of the cities that you give to the descendants of Levi will be cities to which
people can run to be safe. If someone accidentally kills someone else, the one who
killed that person may run to one of those cities to be safe.
7 You must also give to the descendants of Levi 42 other cities and the land around
those cities, for their animals,.
8 The Israeli tribes that have the most people must give them more cities than the
tribes that have fewer people give. Each tribe must give some of its cities to the
descendants of Levi, but the tribes that have more land must give more cities, and
the tribes that have less land will give fewer cities.”
9 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
10 “Tell this to the Israeli people: When you cross the Jordan River and enter the
Canaan region,
11 you must choose some cities to which people can run to be safe/protected. If
someone kills another person ◄accidentally/without planning to do that►, the one
who killed that person may run to one of those cities and be safe.

that will be on the west side, in the Canaan region.
NUMBERS 35:15
251
NUMBERS 35:33
15 Those six cities will be cities where Israeli people may run to and be safe, and
where foreigners and other people who are living among you can also run to and be
safe. Any of those people who accidentally kills someone may run to one of those
cities and be safe/protected there.
16-18 “But you must consider that anyone who kills another person with an iron
weapon or with a big rock or with a piece of wood, is a murderer, and the one who
killed the other person must be executed.
19 A relative of the person who was murdered must be the one who executes the
murderer as soon as he finds him.
20 If someone shoves another person over a cliff or throws something at another
person
21 or hits that person with his hand/fist and causes that person to die, if he did it
because he hated that person, then you must consider that he is a murderer, and must
be executed. A relative of the person who was killed must be the one who executes
the murderer as soon as he finds him.
22 “But someone might accidentally shove someone else, or accidentally throw
something at another person and hit him, not because he hates that person.
23 Or he might drop a rock on someone that he did not see. If the one who does
that does not plan to hurt anyone and does not hate the person that was killed,
24 the people of that city must decide whether the relative of the dead person has
the right to get revenge, or whether the one who killed the other person truly did it
◄accidentally/without planning to do it►.
25 If they decide that the killer planned to kill the other person, they must not allow
him to stay in their city. But if they decide that it was done accidentally, they must
protect the killer from being killed by the dead person’s relative. They must send the
killer to one of the cities where he will be safe/protected, and allow him to stay there
until the Supreme Priest dies. After that, the killer may go back to his home, because
the dead person’s relative no longer has the right to get revenge.
26 “But while the Supreme Priest is still living, the person who is in that safe city
must not leave that city.
27 If he goes outside the city, and if a relative of the dead person finds him, that
relative is permitted to kill that person, and people will not consider that the relative
is guilty of murder.
28 The killer must stay in that city where he will be safe/protected until the Supreme

Land for Zelophehad’s daughters
36
1 The family leaders of the clan of Gilead of the tribe of Manasseh went to Moses/
me and the other family leaders of the Israeli people.
2 They said to Moses/me, “Yahweh commanded you, our leader, to apportion the
land to the Israeli tribes by throwing ◄lots/stones that have been marked► to decide
which group would get which area. Yahweh also commanded you to give the land that
belonged to our fellow Israeli Zelophehad to his daughters.
3 But if his daughters marry men from the other Israeli tribes, that land will no
longer belong to our tribe. People of other tribes will get it. So some of our land will
no longer belong to us.
4 When the Year of Celebration comes, when all the land that has been bought by
someone is returned to its original owners, the land that belonged to Zelophehad will
belong to the tribes of the men that his daughters marry. So some of our land, the
land that we received from our fathers, will be taken from us, and we will never own
it again.”
5 Yahweh told Moses/me what to reply to them, so Moses/I said this to them: “These
men from the tribe of Manasseh are right.
6 This is what Yahweh is saying to the daughters of Zelophehad: ‘Each of you may
marry anyone you want to, but you must marry only someone from your own tribe.’
7 In that way, the land that belongs to Israelis will not be passed from one tribe
to another tribe. Each Israeli will keep the land in the tribe that belonged to his
ancestors.
8 A woman who inherits her father’s land may get married, but she must marry
someone from her own tribe. In that way, every Israeli will keep the land that
belonged to his ancestors.
9 The land must not be passed from one tribe to another tribe. Each Israeli tribe
must keep the land that it received from its ancestors.”
10 Zelophehad’s daughters obeyed what Yahweh told Moses/me.
11 The five daughters—Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah and Noah—married their
12 The men whom they married were from the tribe of Manasseh, so their land

River, across from Jericho.

DEUTERONOMY 1:15
This book contains the account of Moses’ final speeches
to the Israeli people. We call this book
Deuteronomy
Introduction to Moses’ first speech
1 In this book is written what Moses/I said to the Israeli people. He/I told them these
things when they/we were in the desert, on the east side of the Jordan River. They/
We had set up our tents near a place named Suph, between Paran town on the one
side of the river and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab towns on the other side of
the river.
2 To walk from Sinai Mountain to the Kadesh-Barnea oasis, people usually travel
for only eleven days, going by way of the hilly area named Edom.
3 Forty years after ◄the Israelis/we► left Egypt, in the middle of January, Moses/I
told the Israeli people everything that Yahweh had commanded him/me to tell them.
4 This was after they/we had defeated Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group,
who lived in Heshbon city, and Og, the king of the Bashan region who lived in
Ashtaroth and Edrei towns.
5 Moses/I told them these things while the people were in the Moab region, on the
east side of the Jordan River. He/I ◄explained to them/enabled them to understand►
God’s laws. This is what he/I said to them:
6 “Yahweh our God said to us when we were at Sinai Mountain, ‘You have stayed
for a very long time at the bottom of this mountain.
7 So now continue traveling. Go to the hilly area where the Amor people-group lives
and to the nearby areas—to the Jordan River Valley, to the hilly region, to the western
◄foothills/hills at the bottom of the mountains►, to the desert area to the south, to
the Mediterranean Seacoast, to all of Canaan land, to the Lebanon Mountains, and
northeast to the great Euphrates River.
8 Note that I will give that land to you. I, Yahweh, promised to your ancestors
Abraham and Isaac and Jacob that I would give it to them and to their descendants.
So now go and occupy it.’ ”
Moses reminded them that he had appointed leaders
9 Moses/I also said to the people, “When we were still at Sinai Mountain, I told your
ancestors ‘It is a very big burden/responsibility for me to govern all of you. So I
cannot do it by myself.
10 Yahweh our God has caused us Israelis to now become as numerous as the stars
in the sky.
11 And I hope/desire that Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors worshiped, will
cause us to become 1,000 times as numerous as we are now and that he will bless us
just like he promised to do.
12 But I certainly cannot [RHQ] ◄solve/deal with► all of your complaints/problems.
13 So choose some men from your tribes who are wise and who have good sense
and who are respected. Then I will appoint them to be your leaders.’
14 Your ancestors replied, ‘What you have suggested is good for us to do.’
15 So I took the wise and respected men that your ancestors chose from your tribes,
and I appointed them to be your leaders. I appointed some to ◄rule/have authority►
over 1,000 people, some to have authority over 100 people, some to have authority
DEUTERONOMY 1:16
254
DEUTERONOMY 1:32-33
over 50 people, and some to have authority over ten people. I also appointed other
officers from throughout your tribes.
16 I instructed/told your leaders, ‘Listen to the disputes that occur among your
people. Judge each dispute, including disputes between close relatives and quarrels
between your people and people from other countries who live among you.
17 You must ◄be impartial/not favor one person more than another►; you must
treat poor people and important people equally. You must not worry about what
anyone will think about how you decide matters, because you will decide matters as
God wants you to. If any quarrel/dispute is very difficult and you are unable to decide
it, bring it to me, and I will decide.’
18 At that time I also told you other things that you should do.”
Moses reminded them about sending the spies
19 “Then, just like Yahweh our God commanded us, we left Sinai Mountain and went
through that huge desert that was very ◄dangerous/difficult to travel through►, on
the road to the hilly area where the Amor people-group live. We arrived at KadeshBarnea.
20 I said to your ancestors, ‘We have now come to the hilly area where the Amor
people-group live. This is part of the area that Yahweh our God, the one whom our
ancestors worshiped, is giving to us.
21 Note that Yahweh our God is giving this land to us. So go and occupy it as he
commanded. Do not be ◄at all/even a little bit► afraid.’
some men there to explore the land, in order that they can return and tell us which
23 I thought that it would be good to do that, so I chose twelve men, one man from
24 They went up into the hilly area as far as Eshcol Valley, and they explored all
that area.
25 They picked some of the fruit that they found there and brought it to us. They
reported that the land that Yahweh our God was giving to us is very good/fertile.”
Moses reminded them how God punished them when they refused to go
They rebelled against
what Yahweh our God had commanded them to do, and they would not go into that
land.
27 Your ancestors stayed in their tents and complained saying ‘Yahweh hates us. So
he has brought us here from Egypt just to allow the Amor people-group to destroy us.
28 ◄Why should we go there?/We do not want to go there.► [RHQ] The men whom
we sent there have caused us to become very discouraged/afraid. They have told us
that the people there are much stronger and taller than we are and that there are
extremely high [HYP] walls around their towns. Also they reported that they saw
giants there that are descendants of Anak.’
29 Then I said to your ancestors, ‘Do not be afraid ◄at all/even a little bit► [DOU]
of those people!
30 Yahweh our God will go ahead of you, and he will fight for you, just like you saw
him do for you in Egypt
31 and in the desert. You saw how he brought you safely here, like a man would
carry his son. [SIM]’
32-33 I reminded them that he always went ahead of them while they traveled in
the desert. He directed them by a pillar of fire during the night and a pillar of cloud
26 “But your ancestors refused to go and conquer that land.
DEUTERONOMY 1:34
255
DEUTERONOMY 2:7
during the day. He showed them places to set up their tents. But in spite of what I
said, your ancestors would not trust Yahweh our God.
34 Yahweh heard what they said, and he became angry. He solemnly declared,
35-36 ‘Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, will enter the land. He has obeyed me completely.
So I will give to him and to his descendants some of the land that he explored. He
is the only one of all you people who will enter that land. None of these evil people
will ever see that good land which I solemnly promised to give to your ancestors.’
37 But because of what your ancestors did, Yahweh was also angry with me. He said
to me, ‘You also will not enter that land.
38 Joshua, the son of Nun, who is your helper, will enter it. Encourage him, because
he is the one who will enable you Israeli people to occupy that land.’
39 Then Yahweh said to all of us, ‘You said that your children would be captured by
what is evil. But they are the ones to whom I will give that land, and they will enter
40 But as for you, turn around and go back into the desert, toward the ◄Red Sea/
41 Then your ancestors replied, ‘We have sinned; we have disobeyed Yahweh. So
we will go and attack the people who live in that land, just like Yahweh our God
commanded us to do.’ And each of their men put on his weapons, and they thought
that it would be easy to invade the hilly region.
42 But Yahweh said to me, ‘Tell them, “Do not go up there and attack those people,
because I will not go with you. If you go, your enemies will defeat you.” ’
43 So I told that to your ancestors, but they would not heed what I said. They
again rebelled against what Yahweh commanded them to do. Their soldiers proudly/
arrogantly marched up into that hilly region.
44 Then the men of the Amor people-group who lived in that region came out of
their towns and attacked those soldiers. They pursued your ancestors’ soldiers like
a swarm of bees pursues people, and they pursued them south from the Edom area
and defeated them at Hormah city.
45 So your ancestors went back to Kadesh-Barnea and cried out to request Yahweh
to help them, but he did not heed them. He did not pay any attention to them [DOU].
46 So we stayed there at Kadesh-Barnea for a long time.”
2
Moses reminded them of their wandering in the desert
1 “Then we turned around and went through the desert toward the ◄Red Sea/Gulf
of Aqaba►, as Yahweh told us to do, and we wandered in the Edom area for many
years.
2 Then Yahweh said to me,
3 ‘You have been wandering around this hilly area for a long enough time. Now
turn and travel toward the north.
4 And tell the people that they are about to travel near the land that belongs to the
descendants of Esau, who are also descendants of Isaac. They live in the hilly Edom
region. They will be afraid of you,
5 but do not start to fight against them, because I am not going to give you even a
tiny bit [HYP] of their land. I have given that land to the descendants of Esau.
6 When you travel near their land, buy food and water from them.’
7 Do not forget that Yahweh our God has blessed you in everything that you [SYN]
have done. He knows what has happened to you while you have wandered in this
DEUTERONOMY 2:8
256
DEUTERONOMY 2:25
huge desert. But he has been with you during those 40 years, and as a result you
have had everything that you needed [LIT].
descendants of Esau live. We stayed away from the road through the Jordan River
Valley past Ezion-Geber and Elath towns, and we turned and traveled northeast
toward the desert area where the Moab people-group lives.
9 Yahweh said to me, ‘Do not bother/harass the people of Moab, and do not start
to fight against them, because I am not going to give you any of their land. Do not
forget that they are descendants of Abraham’s nephew Lot, and I have given to them
Ar city, their capital, and the other areas in that country.’ ”
10 A large group of giants called Emim formerly lived there. They were strong and
numerous, and as tall as the giants who were descendants of Anak.
11 They and the descendants of Anak are also called the Repha giants, but the people
of Moab call them Emim.
12 The Hor people-group also formerly lived in the Edom area, but the descendants
their land, just as the Israeli people later expelled their enemies from the land that
13 I also said to the Israeli people, “Then we crossed the Zered Gorge, as Yahweh
14 It had been thirty-eight years from the time we first left Kadesh-Barnea until we
crossed the Zered Gorge. During those years, all the Israeli ◄fighting men/soldiers►
of that generation had died, as Yahweh had vowed would happen.
15 They died because Yahweh opposed them, until he had gotten rid of all of them.
16 After all the men who had been old enough to fight in wars had died [DOU],
17 Yahweh said to me,
18 ‘Today you all must cross the border into the Moab region, near Ar, their capital
city.
19 When you come near the border of the land where the Ammon people-group live,
do not bother/harass them or start to fight against them. They are also descendants
of Lot, so I am not going to give you any of the land that I have given to them.’ ”
Other groups that lived near Canaan
20 That region is also called the land of the Repha giants, who formerly lived there.
The Ammon people-group call them the Zamzum group.
21 They were a large and powerful group, who were as tall as the descendants of
Anak. But Yahweh got rid of them, and the Ammon people-group expelled them and
took their land away from them and started to live there.
22 Yahweh had done the same thing for the descendants of Esau who live in the
hilly area of Edom. He got rid of the Hor people-group, with the result that the Edom
people-group took their land from them and started to live there. They still live there.
23 People who came from Crete Island got rid of the Av group who previously lived
in the land close to the Mediterranean Sea, as far south as Gaza. They took their land
from them and started to live there.
Moses reminded them of crossing the Arnon River
24 “After we had gone through the Moab region, Yahweh said to us, ‘Now cross the
Arnon River. I will help you to defeat [IDM] the army of Sihon, the king of the Amor
people-group, who lives in Heshbon city. So attack their army and start to take their
land from them.
25 Today I will begin to cause everyone, everywhere, to be afraid of you. Everyone
who hears about you will tremble and be terrified.’
DEUTERONOMY 2:26
257
DEUTERONOMY 3:9
26 Then I sent messengers to go from the desert to King Sihon at Heshbon.
I told
them to give this peaceful message to the king:
27 ‘Please allow us to travel through your land. We promise that we will stay on the
road; we will not turn off to the right or to the left.
28 We will pay for any food or water that you allow us to buy. We want only to
walk through your country,
29 until we cross the Jordan River into the land that Yahweh our God is giving to us.
Do for us just as the descendants of Esau who live in the Edom area and the Moab
people-group did for us when they allowed us to go through their areas.’
30 But King Sihon would not allow us to go through his country. That was because
Yahweh our God caused him to be stubborn [IDM]. The result was that Yahweh
31 Yahweh said to me, ‘Listen! I am about to allow you to defeat Sihon’s army and
32 Then Sihon came out of the city with all his army to fight against us at Jahaz town.
all his soldiers.
34 We captured all their cities and destroyed them all. We killed all the men and
women and children; we did not allow any of them to remain alive.
35 We took the valuable things that were in the cities that we captured and also
their cattle.
36 Yahweh our God enabled us to capture [IDM] all their towns from Aroer in the
south, which is at the edge of the Arnon River Valley, to the Gilead region in the north.
Some of their cities had walls around them, but we were able to climb over them.
37 But we did not go near the area where the Ammon people-group live, or the
banks of the Jabbok riverbed, or the towns in the hilly area, or any other place where
Yahweh our God told us not to go.”
3
Moses reminded them of the defeat of King Og
1 “Then we turned north and went toward the Bashan region. Og, the king of that
area, and all his soldiers marched south to fight against us at Edrei town.
2 Yahweh said to me, ‘Do not be afraid of him, because I will enable your army to
defeat [MTY] him and all his army and to capture all their land. Do to him what you
did to Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group, who ruled in Heshbon city.’
3 “So Yahweh enabled us to defeat [IDM] King Og and all his army. We killed them
all; we did not allow any of them to remain alive.
4 There were 60 cities in that region near Argob, in King Og’s kingdom of Bashan.
But we captured all of them
5 All those cities had high walls around them with gates and bars. We also captured
many villages that did not have walls around them.
6 We completely destroyed everything, just as we had done in the area that King
Sihon ruled. We killed all the men, women, and children.
7 But from those cities we took for ourselves all the livestock and other valuable
things.
8 “So at that time we took from those two kings of the Amor people-group all the
land east of the Jordan River, from the Arnon River gorge in the south to Hermon
Mountain in the north.”
9 (That mountain is called Sirion by the people of Sidon city and is called Senir by
the Amor people-group.)
DEUTERONOMY 3:10

DEUTERONOMY 3:25
10 “We captured all the towns on the ◄plateau/high level land►, and all the Gilead
region, and all the Bashan region as far east as Edrei and Salecah towns, which also
belonged to Og’s kingdom.”
11 (Og was the last king who was a descendant of the Repha giants. His bed was
is still [RHQ] in Rabbah city in the Ammon area.)
Moses reminded them of dividing the land east of the Jordan
and Gad the land north of Aroer town near the Arnon River, and some of the hilly
area of the Gilead region, along with the nearby towns.
13 The other part of the Gilead region and all of the Bashan region, which was the
Argob region that King Og had ruled, I allotted to half of the tribe of Manasseh.” (The
entire Bashan region is called the land of the Repha giants.)
14 “Jair, from the tribe of Manasseh, conquered all the Bashan area as far north
as the border of the Geshur and Maacah territories. He gave his own name to the
villages there, and they are still called the villages of Jair.
15 The northern part of the Gilead region I allotted to the Machir clan, who are
descendants of the tribe of Manasseh.
16 I allotted to the tribes of Reuben and Gad the southern part of the Gilead region,
extending south to the Arnon River. The middle of the river is the southern boundary.
The northern boundary is the Jabbok River, which is part of the border of the Ammon
17 To the west their territory extended to the Jordan River Valley, from Galilee Lake
east.
18 At that time, I told you three tribes, ‘Yahweh our God is giving you this land east
of the Jordan River, for you to occupy/capture. So now, give your soldiers weapons,
and send them across the Jordan River ahead of the men from the other Israeli tribes
to help them to conquer/capture the land that has been allotted to them.
19 But your wives and children and your very numerous cattle must stay in the
towns that I have allotted to you.
20 Your men must help your fellow Israelis until Yahweh enables them to live there
peacefully after they capture all the land that Yahweh our God is giving to them on
the west side of the Jordan River, just like he did for you here on the east side of the
river. After that, you all may return to this land that I have allotted to you.’
21 And I told Joshua, ‘You [SYN] have seen everything that Yahweh our God did to
those two kings, Sihon and Og. He will do the same thing to the people who are now
in the land that you will be entering.
22 Do not be afraid of those people, because Yahweh our God is the one who will
fight for you all.’ ”
Moses reminded them that he was not allowed to enter Canaan
23 “At that time, I earnestly prayed, saying
24 ‘Yahweh our Lord, you have merely begun to show me that you are very great
and to show me the powerful things that you can do [MTY]. There is certainly no
[RHQ] god in heaven or on earth who can do the powerful things/deeds that you have
done.
25 So please allow me to cross the Jordan River and to see the good/fertile land on
the west side, the beautiful hilly area and the mountains in Lebanon.’
DEUTERONOMY 3:26
259
DEUTERONOMY 4:14
26 But Yahweh was angry with me because of what your ancestors had made me do,
so he would not pay attention to me. Instead, he said, ‘That is enough talk from you!
Do not talk to me about that again!
27 Climb up to the top of Pisgah Mountain and look toward the west and to the east,
toward the north and to the south. Look at [MTY] it all carefully, because you will
not cross the Jordan River to see the land from there.
28 But tell Joshua what he must do and encourage him to be strong, because he is
the one who will lead the people across the river in order that they can occupy/capture
the land that you will see from the top of the mountain.’
29 So we remained in the Jordan River Valley close to Beth-Peor town.”
4
Moses urged the people to obey God’s laws
1 “Now, you Israeli people, obey all the rules and regulations [DOU] that I will teach
you. If you do that, you will remain alive and you will enter and occupy/capture the
land that Yahweh, the God whom your ancestors worshiped, is giving to you.
2 Do not add anything to what I command you, and do not take anything away from
what I tell you. Obey all the commands of Yahweh our God that I am giving to you.
3 “You have seen what Yahweh did at Baal-Peor Mountain. He got rid of all the
people who worshiped the god Baal there,
4 but you who faithfully continued to worship Yahweh our God are still alive today.
5 “Note that I have taught you all the rules and regulations, just like Yahweh our
God told me to do. He wants you to obey them when you are living in the land that
you are about to enter and occupy.
6 Obey them faithfully because, if you do that, you will show the people of other
nations that you are very wise. When they hear about all these laws, they will say,
‘The people of this great nation of Israel are certainly very wise [DOU]!’
7 Even if other nations are great, there is none [RHQ] of them that has a god who
is as near to them as Yahweh our God is to us! Whenever we call out to him to help
us, he answers/helps us
8 And there is no [RHQ] other nation, even if it is a great nation, that has laws that
are as just/fair as the laws that I am telling to you today.
9 “But be very careful! [DOU, IDM] Do not forget what you [SYN] have seen God do.
Remember those things as long as you are alive. Tell them to your children and your
grandchildren.
10 Tell them about the day that your ancestors stood in the presence of Yahweh our
God at Sinai Mountain, when he said to me, ‘Gather the people together, in order that
they can hear what I say. I want them to learn to have an awesome respect for me
as long as they are alive, and I want them to teach their children to do that also.’
11 Tell them that your ancestors came near the bottom of the mountain, while the

heard him speak, but they did not see him. They only heard his voice.
Commandments that he wants you to obey. He wrote those on two stone tablets.
that you would obey them in the land that you are about to enter and occupy.”
Moses warned them about worshiping idols
DEUTERONOMY 4:15
260
DEUTERONOMY 4:32
15 “On the day that Yahweh spoke to your ancestors at Sinai Mountain, he was
invisible. So, be careful
16 that you do not sin by making for yourselves any idol of something that can be
seen! Do not make an idol that resembles any person, either a man or a woman,
17 or that resembles any animal or any bird
18 or any ◄reptile/creature that scurries across the ground► or any fish in the deep
ocean.
19 And be careful to not look up toward the sky and be tempted to worship anything
that you see there—the sun or the moon or the stars. Yahweh our God has given those
to be a blessing to all people everywhere, but you must not worship them.
20 Yahweh has brought your ancestors out of Egypt, where they were suffering as
though they were in a blazing furnace, in order that they would be people who belong
to him, which is what you are today.
21 “But Yahweh was angry with me because of what your ancestors made me do.
He vowed that I would not cross the Jordan River to enter the good/fertile land that
he is giving to you.
22 He said that I must die here in this land and never cross the Jordan River. But
you will go across it, and you will occupy that land.
23 Be sure that you do not forget the agreement that Yahweh our God made with
you. He commanded you to not make any kind of idol, because he has forbidden that.
24 You must not do that because Yahweh your God will destroy anyone who worships
idols, like [MET] a fire completely destroys things. He wants people to worship only
him, he ◄cannot accept/will punish► people who worship anyone or anything else.
25 “When you have been in the land of Canaan for a long time and you have children
and grandchildren, do not sin by making an idol that represents anything at all,
because Yahweh says that is evil, and if you do that, you will cause him to become
angry with you and punish you.
26 Today I am requesting everyone who is in heaven and everyone who is on the
earth [MTY] to watch what you are doing. If you disobey what I am telling you, you
will soon all die in the land that you will be crossing the Jordan River to occupy. You
will not live very long there; Yahweh will completely get rid of many [HYP] of you.
27 And the rest of you, Yahweh will force you to go and live among the people of
many other nations. Only a few of you will ◄survive/remain alive► there.
28 When you are in those nations, you will worship gods that are made of wood
and stone, gods made by humans, gods that cannot see anything or hear anything or
eat anything or smell anything.
29 But while you are there, if you will try to know Yahweh your God, and if you try
with your entire inner being to know him, he will ◄answer/reveal himself to► you.
30 In the future, after you have been mistreated there and all those bad things
happen to you, you will again worship only Yahweh and obey him.
31 Yahweh is a God who acts mercifully. If you continue to obey him, he will not
abandon you or destroy you or forget the agreement that he solemnly made with
your ancestors.”
Only Yahweh is God
32 “Now think about the past, about the time before you were born, about all the
time since God first created people here on the earth. You could search everywhere,
in heaven and on the earth. ◄Has anything like this ever happened that is as great
as what Yahweh did for the Israeli people?/Certainly nothing has ever happened that
is as great as what Yahweh did for the Israeli people.► [RHQ] ◄Has anyone ever heard
of anything like this?/Certainly no one has ever heard of anything like this.► [RHQ]

DEUTERONOMY 4:49
33 ◄Has any group ever remained alive after they heard a god speak to them from
the middle of a fire, like we did?/Certainly no group has ever remained alive after
they heard a god speak to them from the middle of a fire, like we did.► [RHQ]
34 Certainly no other god has ever tried to take a huge group of people from one
nation to another location, like he did for us when he brought us out of Egypt. We
saw Yahweh our God use great power [MTY, DOU] when he performed many kinds of
[DOU] miracles, and sent plagues, and did many other very terrifying things in Egypt
for us, and rescued us when the army of Egypt tried to fight against us.
35 “Yahweh showed all these things to you, in order that you would know that only
he is truly God, and that there is no other God.
36 He allowed your ancestors to hear him speak from heaven in order that he could
discipline them. Here on the earth he allowed them to see his great fire on Sinai
Mountain, and he spoke to them from the middle of the fire.
37 Because he loved our ancestors, he chose you Israelis who are their descendants,

things will go well for you and for your descendants, and that you will live a long

The cities of refuge
41 Then Moses/I set apart three cities that are on the east side of the Jordan River.
42 If someone accidentally killed another person, a person who had not been his
enemy previously, he could escape to one of those cities. He would be safe/protected
in one of those cities because the people there would protect him.
43 For the tribe of Reuben, Moses/I set apart Bezer city in the ◄plateau/high level►
area. For the tribe of Gad, Moses/I set apart Ramoth city in the Gilead area. For the
Where Moses gave them God’s laws
44 Moses/I gave God’s laws to the Israeli people.
45 They included all the rules and instructions and commands that Moses/I gave to
them, after they/we had come out of Egypt,
46 when they/we were in the valley east of the Jordan River. They/We were across
from Beth-Peor town, in the land that previously was ruled by Sihon, the king of the
Amor people-group, who lived in Heshbon city. Moses/I and the other Israelis had
defeated his army when they/we came out of Egypt.
47 They/We captured Sihon’s land and the land that Og, the king of the Bashan
region, ruled. They were the two kings who ruled the Amor people-group in the area
east of the Jordan River.
48 Their land extended from Aroer town in the south along the Arnon River, as far
north as Sirion Mountain, which most people call Hermon Mountain.
49 It also included all the area east of the Jordan River Valley, all the way south to
the Dead Sea and east to the slopes of Pisgah Mountain.

Moses repeated for them the Ten Commandments
DEUTERONOMY 5:1
262
1 Moses/I summoned all the people of Israel and said to them,
DEUTERONOMY 5:22
“You Israeli people, listen to all the rules and regulations that I am giving to you
today. Learn them and be sure to obey them.
2 When we were at Sinai Mountain, Yahweh our God made an agreement with us.
3 But this agreement was not only for our ancestors. He made it also for us who
are alive now.
4 Yahweh spoke with us face-to-face on that mountain, from the middle of the fire.
5 On that day, I stood between your ancestors and Yahweh to tell them what he
said, because they were afraid of the fire, and they did not climb up the mountain.
This is what Yahweh said:
of the land of Egypt. I am the one who freed you from being slaves there.
8 You must not carve/make for yourselves any idol that represents anything in the
sky or anything that is on the ground or anything that swims in the water.
9 You must not bow down to any idol and worship it, because I am Yahweh God,
and I ◄am very jealous/want you to worship me only►. I punish those who
sin and hate me. I punish not only them, but I will punish ◄their descendants,
down to the third and fourth generation/their children and grandchildren and
great-grandchildren►.
10 But I will steadfastly love ◄thousands of generations/all the descendants► of
those who love me and obey my commandments (OR, I will love for thousands of
generations).
11 Do not use/speak my name carelessly (OR, for wrong/evil purposes), because I
am Yahweh God, the one whom you should worship, and I will certainly punish
those who use/speak my name for wrong/evil purposes [LIT].
12 Do not forget that the seventh day of every week is mine. Dedicate those days to
me just like I, Yahweh your God, am commanding you.
13 There are six days each week for you to do all your work,
14 but the seventh day is a rest day, a day dedicated to me, Yahweh your God. On
that day you must not do any work. You and your sons and daughters and your male
and female slaves must not work. You must not even force your livestock to work,
and you must not tell foreigners to work, those who are living in your country. You
must allow your slaves to rest on that day just like you do.
15 Do not forget that you were slaves in Egypt, and that I, Yahweh your God, brought
you out from there by my very great power. [DOU, MTY] That is the reason that I am
commanding that all of you must rest on the seventh/Sabbath day each week.
16 Honor/Respect your fathers and your mothers, just like I, Yahweh your God, am
commanding you, in order that you may live a long time in the land that I, Yahweh
your God, will give you, and in order that things will go well for you there.
17 Do not murder anyone.
18 Do not ◄commit adultery/have sex with anyone other than your spouse►.
19 Do not steal anything.
20 Do not tell lies about anyone when you are speaking in a court.
21 Do not ◄covet/ desire to have► someone else’s wife, someone else’s house,
someone else’s fields, someone else’s male slave or female slave, someone else’s
livestock, someone else’s donkeys, or anything else that another person owns.’
22 Those are the commandments that Yahweh spoke to your ancestors. When they
were gathered there at the bottom of the mountain, he spoke with a very loud voice
from the middle of the fire, and there were dark clouds surrounding the mountain.
DEUTERONOMY 5:23
263
DEUTERONOMY 6:6
He spoke only those ten commandments, no more. Then he wrote them on two stone
tablets and gave them to me.
23 After your ancestors heard Yahweh’s voice when he spoke to them out of the
darkness, while there was a big fire burning on the mountain, their leaders and
elders came to me,
24 and one of them said, ‘Listen to us! Yahweh our God showed us that he is very
great and glorious when we heard him speak [MTY] from the fire. Today we have
spoken to us.
to us again; his terrible fire will destroy/kill us.
27 So Moses, you go up the mountain and listen to everything that Yahweh our God
what he has said and obey it.’
28 Yahweh heard your leaders say that, so when I went back up the mountain, Yahweh
said to me, ‘I have heard what your leaders have said, and what they have said is
right/correct.
29 I surely wish that they would always think like that and revere me and obey
all my commandments, in order that things may go well for them and for their
descendants forever.
30 So go down and tell them to return to their tents.
31 But then you come back up here and stand near me, and I will give to you all
the rules and regulations that I want them to obey. Then you can teach them to the
people, in order that they will obey them when they are in the land that I am giving
to them.’
32 So I went back down to the people, and I said to them, ‘Be sure that you do
everything that Yahweh our God has commanded us to do. Do not disobey any of
his laws.
33 Conduct your lives as Yahweh our God has commanded us to do, in order that
you may live a long time, and in order that things will go well for you when you are
living in the land that you will occupy.’ ”
6
The commandment to love God
1 “These are the commandments and rules and regulations that Yahweh our God
commanded me to teach to you. He wants you to obey them in the land that you are
about to enter and occupy.
2 He wants you to revere him, and he wants you and your descendants to always
obey all these rules and regulations that I am giving to you, in order that you may
live for a long time.
3 So, you Israeli people, listen to them carefully and obey them. If you do that, things
will go well with you, and you will become a nation with a very large population when
you are living in that very fertile [IDM] land. That is what Yahweh, the God whom
our ancestors worshiped, promised would happen.
4 “You Israeli people, listen! Only Yahweh is our God.
5 You must love him with all your inner being and with all that you feel and with
all that you do.
6 Never forget [IDM] these commands that I am giving to you today.
DEUTERONOMY 6:7
264
DEUTERONOMY 7:1
7 Teach them to your children again and again. Talk about them all the time: When
you are in your houses and when you are walking outside; talk about them when
you are lying down and when you are doing things.
8 Write them on tiny scrolls and fasten them to your arms/wrists, and write them
on bands that you fasten to your foreheads to help you to remember them.
10 “Yahweh our God vowed to your ancestors Abraham and Isaac and Jacob that
not build.
11 He said that the houses in those cities will already be full of many good things
that others put there; you did not put them there. There will be wells that others have
dug. There will be vineyards and olive trees that others planted. So when Yahweh
brings you into that land, and you have all that you want to eat,
12 be sure that you do not forget Yahweh who rescued you from being slaves in
Egypt and gave all these things to you.
13 “You must revere Yahweh our God, and you must serve only him and say that he
should [MTY] punish you if you do not do what you have promised.
14 You must not worship any other gods, the gods that the people-groups who will
live near you worship.
15 Yahweh our God, who lives among you, ◄will not accept/will punish► people
who worship anyone or anything else. So if you worship any other god, Yahweh will
be very angry with you, and he will get rid of you completely.
16 Do not do sinful things to find out if you can do them without Yahweh our God
punishing you, like your ancestors did at Massah.
17 Be sure that you always obey all the laws, the commandments, the rules, and the
regulations that he has given to you.
18 Do what Yahweh says is right and good. If you do that, things will go well with
you. You will be able to enter and occupy the good/fertile land that Yahweh vowed
to give to our ancestors.
19 He will do that by expelling your enemies from that land, just like he promised
to do.
20 “In the future, when your children ask you, ‘Why did Yahweh our God command
us to obey all these rules and regulations?’
21 tell them, ‘Our ancestors were slaves of the king in Egypt, but Yahweh brought
them out of Egypt by his great power [MTY].
22 They saw him do many kinds of miracles [DOU] and do terrifying things to the
people of Egypt and to the king and his officials.
23 He rescued our ancestors from Egypt and brought them here to give them this
land, just like he vowed that he would do.
24 And he commanded us to obey all these laws and to revere him, for our own
good and in order that he would protect our nation and enable us to prosper, as he
is doing now.
25 Yahweh our God will ◄approve of us/consider us to be righteous► if we carefully
obey everything that he has commanded us to do.’ ”
7
The blessings of worshiping God only
1 “Yahweh our God will bring you to the land that you will soon enter and occupy.
As you advance, he will expel from that land seven people-groups that are more
powerful and more numerous than you are. He will expel the Heth people-group, the
DEUTERONOMY 7:2
people-group, the Hiv people-group, and the Jebus people-group.
2 When Yahweh our God enables you to defeat [DOU] them, you must kill all of
them. You must not make ◄an alliance/a peace treaty► with any of them. You must
not act mercifully toward them.
3 You must not marry any of them. You must not allow your daughters to marry
any of their sons or allow your sons to marry any of their daughters.
4 Because, if you did that, those people would cause your children to stop
worshiping Yahweh and to worship other gods. If that happens, Yahweh will be
very angry with you and he will get rid of you immediately.
5 This is what you must do to those people: Tear down their ◄altars/places for
sacrificing animals►, break apart the stone pillars that are dedicated to their male
god Baal, cut down the poles that they use when they worship the goddess Asherah,
and burn their wooden idols.
6 You must do that because you are a group of people who belong to Yahweh our
God. He has chosen you from among all the people-groups in the world to be his own
special people.
7 “It was not because you were more numerous than any other people-group that
Yahweh preferred you; you are one of the smallest people-groups on the earth.
8 Instead, it is because Yahweh loved you and because he wanted to do what he
vowed to your ancestors. That is the reason that he rescued you by his great power
[MTY], and freed you from being slaves [MTY] of the king of Egypt.
9 So do not forget that Yahweh our God is the only/true God. He will do what he
agreed to do for you, and he will faithfully love ◄for 1,000 generations/forever► all
those who love him and who obey his commandments.
10 But for those who hate him, he will ◄pay them back/do to them what they
deserve►; he will punish them and quickly get rid of them.
11 “So you must be sure to obey all the commandments and rules and regulations that
I am giving to you today.
12 If you heed these commands and obey them faithfully, Yahweh our God will do
what he has agreed to do for you, and he will faithfully love you, which is what he
vowed to your ancestors that he would do.
13 He will love you and bless you. He will enable you to have many children [DOU].
He will bless your fields, with the result that you will have plenty of grain and grapes
to make wine and plenty of olive oil. You will have many cattle and sheep. He will do
all these things for you in the land that he promised to your ancestors that he would
give to you.
14 He will bless you more than he will bless any other people-group. All of you will
be able to have/produce children [LIT]. All of your livestock will be able to produce
offspring.
15 And Yahweh will protect you from all illnesses. You will not be afflicted with any
of the dreadful diseases that our ancestors knew about in Egypt, but all your enemies
will be inflicted with those diseases.
16 You must get rid of all the people-groups that Yahweh our God will enable you to
conquer. Do not [SYN] act mercifully toward any of them. And do not worship their
gods, because if you do that, it would be like falling into a trap from which you will
never be able to escape.
17 “Do not think to yourselves, ‘These people-groups are more numerous/powerful
than we are, so we certainly cannot [RHQ] expel them.’
DEUTERONOMY 7:18
266
DEUTERONOMY 8:6
18 Do not be afraid of them. Instead, think about what Yahweh our God did to the
king of Egypt and to all the people whom he ruled.
19 Do not forget the terrible plagues that your ancestors saw Yahweh inflict on
the people of Egypt, and the many [DOU] miracles that he performed, and the very
powerful [DOU, MTY] way by which he brought your ancestors out of Egypt. Yahweh
our God will do the same kind of things to the people-groups that you are afraid of
now.
20 Furthermore, he will cause them to become terrified, and he will destroy those
who remain alive and run away to hide from you.
21 Do not be afraid of those people, because Yahweh our God will be with/among
you. He is a great God; he is the one you should be afraid of.
22 He will expel those people-groups gradually. You should not try to expel all of
them at one time, because if you did that, the number of wild animals would quickly
increase, and you would not be able to get rid of them.
23 Instead, Yahweh will enable you to defeat your enemies one people-group at a
24 He will enable you to defeat [IDM] their kings. After you kill them, their names
stop you; you will destroy all of them.
25 You must burn the wooden idols that represent their gods. Do not desire to take
the silver or gold decorations that are on those idols, because if you take them for
yourselves, they will be like a trap to cause you to want to worship those idols. Yahweh
hates the worship of those idols.
26 You must not bring any of those disgusting idols into your houses, because if you
do that, God will curse you like he curses them. You must hate and despise [DOU]
those idols, because they are things that Yahweh has cursed.”
8
Moses urged them to remember and obey
1 “You must faithfully obey all the commandments that I am giving you today.
If
you do that, you will live a long time, you will become very numerous, and you will
occupy the land that Yahweh solemnly promised your ancestors that he would give
to you.
2 And do not forget how Yahweh our God led us as we traveled through the desert
during these past 40 years. He caused you to have many problems/difficulties, because
he wanted to cause you to realize that you needed to trust him and not yourselves.
And he wanted to test you, to find out what you intended to do [IDM], whether you
would obey his commandments or not.
3 So he caused you to have/experience difficulties. He allowed you to become
hungry. Then he gave you manna food from heaven, food that you and your ancestors
had never eaten before. He did that to teach you that people need food for their
bodies; but they also need food for their spirits, which comes from paying attention to
everything that Yahweh says [MTY].
and our feet did not swell from walking a very long way through the desert.
children.
wants you to do, and revere him.
DEUTERONOMY 8:7
267
DEUTERONOMY 9:3
7 He is about to bring you into a good/fertile land, which has streams which flow
down from the hills and pour/flow out of springs in the valleys.
8 It is a land on which wheat and barley grow, a land where there are fig trees and
pomegranates, and a land where there are olive trees and honey.
9 It is a land where there will be plenty of food for you, where you will ◄not lack
anything/have everything that you need► [LIT], a land which has iron ore in its rocks
and from which you can dig copper ore from its hills.
10 Every day you will eat until your stomachs are full, and you will thank Yahweh
our God for the fertile/good land that he has given you.
11 But, when that happens, be sure not to forget Yahweh our God by disobeying his
commandments and rules and regulations that I am giving to you today.
12 When your stomachs are full every day, and when you have built good houses
and are living in them,
13 and when the number of your cattle and sheep has greatly increased, and when
you have accumulated a large amount of silver and gold, and the amount of all your
other possessions has greatly increased,
14 be sure that you do not become proud [IDM] and forget Yahweh our God, who
rescued your ancestors from being slaves in Egypt and brought them out from there.
15 Do not forget that he led them while they traveled through that huge and terrible
desert, where there were poisonous snakes and scorpions. And do not forget that
where the ground was very dry and there was no water, he caused water to flow for
them out of ◄solid/very hard► rock.
16 Do not forget that in that desert he gave your ancestors manna to eat, food that
they had never eaten before. He caused them to have/experience many problems/
difficulties, because he wanted them to realize that they needed to trust him and not
themselves. And he wanted to test them, to find out whether they intended to obey
him, in order that when those difficulties ended, he would do many good things for
them.
17 Be sure that you do not think to yourselves, ‘I have acquired all these things by
my own power [MTY] and ability.’
18 Do not forget that it is Yahweh our God who has enabled you to become rich. He
does this because he faithfully does what he solemnly promised our ancestors that
he would do.
19 “ solemnly warn you that if you forget Yahweh our God and turn to other gods
and start to serve them and worship them, you will certainly be destroyed.
20 If you do not obey Yahweh our God, he will certainly destroy you just like he will
destroy the people-groups that you will fight against.”

The reason that God will enable them to be victorious
1 “You people of Israel, listen to me! You will soon [HYP] cross the Jordan River. In
the land that you will enter, there are large cities that have very high walls around
them that seem to [HYP] extend up to the sky. There are people-groups in that land
that are more numerous and more powerful than you are.
2 Those people are very tall and strong.
Some of them are giants who are
descendants of Anak. You know about them, and you have heard people say that
no one [RHQ] can defeat the descendants of Anak.
3 But I want you to know that Yahweh our God will go ahead of you. He will be
like a raging/roaring fire. While you advance, he will defeat and destroy them. As a
DEUTERONOMY 9:4
268
DEUTERONOMY 9:18
result, you will quickly be able to expel some of them and kill the others, which is
what Yahweh promised that you would do.
4 “After Yahweh our God has expelled them for you, do not say to yourselves, ‘It
is because we are righteous that Yahweh has enabled us to capture this land.’ The
truth is that it is because the people in that land are wicked that Yahweh will expel
them as you advance.
are righteous that you will enter and capture that land. It is because those peoplegroups are very wicked that Yahweh our God will expel them as you advance, and
that he would do.
is giving you this good/fertile land. I say that because you are not righteous; you are
a very stubborn [IDM] people.”
Moses reminded them of the golden calf
7 “Never forget what your ancestors did in the desert that caused Yahweh our God
to become angry. From the day that we left Egypt until the day that we arrived here,
you and your ancestors have continually rebelled against him.
8 Even at Sinai Mountain your ancestors caused Yahweh to become angry. Because
he was very angry, he was ready to get rid of all of them.
9 When I climbed the mountain to receive from him the stone tablets on which he
had written the Ten Commandments that he was giving to them, I stayed there 40
days and nights, and during that time I did not eat or drink anything.
10 Yahweh gave me the two stone tablets on which he had written the commandments with his own fingers. They were the words/commandments that he had spoken
to your ancestors from the fire on that mountain, when they were gathered together
at the bottom of the mountain.
11 “At the end of those 40 days and nights, Yahweh gave me those two stone tablets
on which he had written those commandments.
12 But then he said to me, ‘Go down the mountain immediately, because the people
whom you are leading, the people whom you led out of Egypt, have committed a
terrible sin! They have very quickly done what I commanded them not to do. They
have made for themselves a metal statue of a calf to worship.’
13 Then Yahweh said to me, ‘I have been watching these people, and I see that they
are very stubborn.
14 So do not try to stop me. I am going to destroy all of them, with the result that
no one anywhere will remember ◄their names [MTY]/that they ever existed►. Then
I will enable you to become the ancestor of a nation that will be more numerous and
more powerful than they are.’
15 So I turned and went down the mountain, carrying in my hands the two stone
tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written. Fire was burning all over the
mountain.
16 I looked, and I was shocked to see that your ancestors had committed a great
sin against Yahweh. They very quickly had begun to do what Yahweh our God had
commanded them not to do. They had requested Aaron to make for them a metal
image of a calf to worship.
17 So while they were watching, I lifted up those two stone tablets and threw them
on the ground, and they broke into pieces.
18 Then I ◄prostrated myself/lay► on the ground in Yahweh’s presence as I had
done before, and I did not eat or drink anything for 40 days and nights. I did that
DEUTERONOMY 9:19
269
DEUTERONOMY 10:6
because your ancestors had sinned against Yahweh and caused him to become very
angry.
19 I was afraid/worried that because Yahweh was very angry with them, he would
get rid of all of them. But again I prayed that he would not do that, and again he
20 Yahweh was also very angry with Aaron for making that golden calf and was ready
prayer.
So I took that statue and I melted it in a fire and crushed it and ground it into very
tiny pieces [HYP]. Then I threw those tiny pieces into the stream that flowed down
the mountain.
22 Your ancestors also caused Yahweh to become very angry by what they did at
places which they named Taberah, Massah, and Kibroth-Hattaavah.
23 And when we were at Kadesh-Barnea, Yahweh said to your ancestors, ‘Go up and
capture the land that I am about to give to you!’ But they rebelled against him. They
did not trust him, and they did not obey what he told [MTY] them to do.
24 Your ancestors rebelled against Yahweh from the first day that I knew them, in
Egypt.
25 So, as I said, I lay on the ground in Yahweh’s presence for 40 days and nights,
because Yahweh had said that he would get rid of your ancestors.
26 And I prayed to Yahweh, saying, ‘Lord God, these people belong to you; do not
destroy them. They are people whom you rescued and brought out of Egypt by your
very great power. [DOU, MTY]
27 Do not forget what you promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Please ignore
these stubborn and wicked people and the sin that they have committed.
28 If you do not do that, and if you get rid of them, the people of Egypt will hear
about it and say that you were not able to bring them into the land that you promised
to give to them. They will say that you took them into the desert only to kill them
there because you hated them.
29 Do not forget that they are your people. You chose them to belong to you. You
brought them out from Egypt by your very great power [DOU, MTY].’ ”
10
A new copy of the Ten Commandments
1 “Then Yahweh said to me, ‘Cut two stone tablets like the first ones. And make a
wooden chest to put them in. Then bring the tablets up to me on this mountain.
2 I will write on those tablets the same words that I wrote on the first tablets, the
ones that you broke. Then you can put them in the chest.’
3 “So I made a chest. I used wood from an acacia tree to make it. Then I cut two
tablets of stone like the first ones, and I went up the mountain carrying the tablets.
4 There Yahweh wrote on the tablets the same Ten Commandments that he had
written on the first tablet. They are the commandments that he told to your ancestors
from the middle of the fire on the mountain, when they were gathered at the bottom
of the mountain. Then Yahweh gave the tablets to me,
5 and I turned and went down the mountain. Then, just as he had commanded, I
put them in the chest that I had made. And they are still there.”
6 (Then, from the wells that belonged to the people of Jaakan, the Israeli people
traveled to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and his son Eleazar took his
place and became the Supreme Priest.

tribes did. What they received was the work/privilege of being Yahweh’s priests,
which is what he said that they should do.)
10 “I stayed on the mountain 40 days and nights, just like I did the first time. I
prayed to Yahweh, and he ◄answered my prayers/did what I requested► again and
said that he would not destroy your ancestors.
11 Then Yahweh said to me, ‘Continue your journey, going in front of the people, to
occupy the land that I vowed your ancestors that I would give to you.’ ”
What Yahweh required
12 “Now, you Israeli people, I will tell you [RHQ] what Yahweh our God requires/
demands that you do. He requires you to revere him, to conduct your lives as he
wants you to, to love him, and to serve him wholeheartedly [DOU],
13 and to obey all of his commandments [DOU] which I am giving to you today for
your benefit.
14 “Do not forget that Yahweh our God owns even the sky and everything that is in
it. He also owns the earth and everything that is on it.
15 But in spite of owning all those things, Yahweh loved your ancestors, and from
all the people-groups on the earth he chose us, their descendants, and we are still his
people.
16 So you must stop sinning [MET] and stop being stubborn [IDM]!
17 Yahweh our God is greater than all gods, and he is greater than all rulers. He is
very powerful [DOU] and awesome. He ◄is impartial/does not do things that favor
one ◄group/person► more than others►, and he does not accept bribes.
18 He makes sure that orphans and widows are treated fairly. He loves even
◄foreigners/people from other countries► who live among us Israeli people, and he
gives them food and clothes.
19 So you must love those foreigners too, because you were once foreigners when
you were living in Egypt.
20 Revere Yahweh our God and worship only him. ◄Be faithful to/Have a close
relationship with► him, and say that he should punish you if you do not do what you
promise.
21 He is the one whom you must praise. He is our God, and we have seen the great
and amazing things that he has done for us.
22 When our ancestors, Jacob and his family, went down to Egypt, there were only
seventy of them. But now Yahweh our God has caused us to be as numerous as the
stars in the sky.”
11
Moses reminded them of the great things that God did
1 “Because of all that Yahweh your God has done for you, you must love him and
continually obey all his rules and regulations and commandments.
DEUTERONOMY 11:2
271
DEUTERONOMY 11:20
2 It was you and your ancestors, not your children, whom he disciplined by causing
all of you to have/experience difficulties. So, starting today, continue to think about
how very great and very powerful he is [DOU, MTY].
3 Think about the various miracles [DOU] that he performed in Egypt. Think about
what he did to the king of Egypt and to his country.
4 Think about what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and their chariots.
Think about how he caused the Red Sea to flood/cover over them while they were
pursuing your ancestors, and how the army of Egypt was completely ◄wiped out/
destroyed►.
5 Think about what Yahweh did for your ancestors in the desert before you arrived

6 Think about what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the two sons of Eliab from the
tribe of Reuben. While all of your ancestors were watching, the earth split open, and
they fell into the opening and disappeared, along with their families and their tents,
their servants, and their animals.
7 You [SYN] and your ancestors have seen all these miracles that Yahweh performed.
8 So, obey all the commandments that I am giving you today, in order that you will
be strong and able to cross the river and occupy the land that you are about to enter,
9 and in order that you will live for a long time in that land, the land that
Yahweh solemnly promised your ancestors that he would give to them and to their
descendants, a land that is very fertile [IDM].
where your ancestors lived. In Egypt, after they planted seeds, it was necessary for
11 But the land that you are about to enter is a land where there are many hills and
12 Yahweh takes care of that land. He [SYN] watches over it every day, from the
beginning of each year to the end of each year.
13 Today I am commanding you to love Yahweh our God and to serve him with your
entire inner beings. If you do that,
14 each year he will send rain on your land at the ◄right times/times when it is
needed►, ◄in the autumn/at the end of the dry season► and ◄in the spring/before
the next dry season starts►. As a result, you will have grain and grapes to make wine
and olives to make olive oil.
15 And he will cause grass to grow in your fields for your livestock to eat. You will
have all the food that you want.
16 “But I warn you, do not turn away from Yahweh our God and start to worship
other gods,
17 because if you do that, Yahweh will become very angry with you. He will prevent
any rain from falling. As a result, the crops will not grow, and you will soon die from
hunger in the good land that Yahweh is about to give to you.
18 So, keep thinking [IDM] about these commands. Write them on tiny scrolls and
fasten them to your arms/wrists, and write them on bands that you fasten to your
foreheads to help you to remember them.
19 Teach them to your children again and again. Talk about them all the time: When
you are in your houses and when you are walking outside; talk about them when you
are lying down at night and when you are getting up in the morning.
20 Write them on the doorposts and on the gates of your houses.
DEUTERONOMY 11:21
272
DEUTERONOMY 12:7
21 Do that in order that you and your children will live for a long time in the land
that Yahweh promised to our ancestors that he would give to them. That land will
belong to you and your descendants as long as there is a sky above the earth.
22 “Faithfully continue to obey what I am commanding you to do—to love Yahweh
our God, and to conduct your lives as he wants you to do, and to ◄be faithful to/have
a close relationship with► him.
23 If you do that, Yahweh will expel all the people-groups in that land as you
advance, people-groups that are more numerous and more powerful than you are.
24 All the ground in that land on which you walk will be yours. Your territory will
extend from the desert in the south to the Lebanon Mountains in the north, and from
the Euphrates River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west.
25 Yahweh our God will cause all the people in that land to be afraid of you, which
is what he promised, with the result that no people-group will be able to stop you.
26 “Listen carefully: Today I am telling you that Yahweh will either bless you or he
will curse you.
27 If you obey the commandments of Yahweh our God that I am giving to you today,
he will bless you.
that you have never known about before, he will curse you.
occupy, some of you must stand on top of Gerizim Mountain and proclaim what will
cause Yahweh to bless you, and the others must stand on top of Ebal Mountain and
proclaim what will cause Yahweh to curse you.”
30 (Those two mountains are [RHQ] west of the Jordan River, west of the Jordan
Valley near the huge oak tree at Moreh village in the land where the Canaan peoplegroup lives. They live close to the sacred trees near Gilgal.)
31 “You will soon cross the Jordan River to occupy the land that Yahweh our God is
giving to you. When you enter that land and start to live there,
32 be sure to obey all the rules and regulations that I am giving to you today.”
The one place for worship
12
1 “◄I will now tell you again/These, again, are► the rules and regulations that you
must faithfully obey in the land that Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors worshiped,
is giving to you to occupy. You must obey these laws all the time that you are alive.
2 You must destroy all the places where the people-groups that you will expel
worship their gods, on the tops of mountains and hills and under big green trees.
3 You must tear down their altars and smash their sacred pillars. Completely burn
the statues of their goddess Asherah in fires, and chop down their wooden idols, in
order that no one will ever worship them [MTY] in those places again.
4 “Do not worship Yahweh like the people in Canaan worship their gods.
5 Instead, you must go to the place that Yahweh will choose. It will be in the area
where one of your tribes will live. That is where you must go to worship Yahweh.
6 That is the place where you must bring your sacrifices that will be completely
burned on the altar, and your other sacrifices, ◄your tithes/ten percent of all of your
crops►, other offerings that you decide to give, and the firstborn animals from your
cattle and sheep.
7 There, in the presence of Yahweh our God, who has greatly blessed you, you and
your families will eat the good things that you have worked to produce, and you will
be happy.
DEUTERONOMY 12:8
273
DEUTERONOMY 12:22
8 “When you are in that land, you must not do some of the things that we have been
doing. Until now, you have all been worshiping Yahweh the way you wanted to,
9 because you have not yet arrived in the land which Yahweh is giving to you, where
you will be able to live peacefully.
10 But when you cross the Jordan River, you will start to live in the land that Yahweh
our God is giving to you. He will protect you from all your enemies that will surround
you, and you will live peacefully/safely.
11 “Yahweh will choose one place where he wants you to worship him. That is
the place to which you must bring all the offerings that I command you to bring:
The sacrifices that must be completely burned on the altar, your other sacrifices,
other offerings that you yourselves decide to give, ◄your tithes/ten percent of all
your crops►, and all the special offerings that you will solemnly promise to give to
12 Rejoice there in the presence of Yahweh, along with your children, your male
forget that the descendants of Levi will not have their own land, like you will have.
13 Be sure that you do not offer sacrifices anywhere you want to.
14 You must offer them only in the place that Yahweh will choose for you, in an
area that belongs to one of your tribes. That is the only place where he wants you to
offer sacrifices that will be completely burned on the altar, and to do the other things
that I am commanding you to do when you worship him.
15 “However, you will be permitted to kill and eat the meat of your animals in the
places where you live. As often as you want to, you may eat the meat of the animals
that Yahweh our God will bless you by giving them to you. Those who have done
things that cause them to become unacceptable to God and those who have not done
things like that may all eat that meat, just like you would eat the meat of a deer or
an antelope.
16 But you must not eat the blood of any animals; you must let the blood drain onto
the ground before you cook the meat.
17 In the places where you live, you must not eat the things that you are offering to
Yahweh: You must not eat the ◄tithes/ten percent► of your grain or of your wine, or
of your olive oil, or the firstborn of your cattle and sheep, or the offerings that you
yourselves decide to give to Yahweh, or any other offerings.
18 Instead, you and your children and your male and female servants and the
descendants of Levi who live in your towns must go to the place that he has chosen
and eat those things there in the presence of Yahweh. And you should rejoice in the
presence of Yahweh about everything that you do.
19 Be sure that you take care of the descendants of Levi all during the time that you
live in your land.
20 “When Yahweh our God gives you much more land than you will have when you
first occupy it, which is what he has promised to do, and you say ‘I would like some
meat to eat’ because you are craving/wanting some meat, you will be permitted to
eat meat whenever you want to.
21 If the place that Yahweh our God chooses to be the place for you to worship him
is far from where you live, you are permitted to kill some of your cattle or sheep that
Yahweh has given to you, and you may eat that meat at the places where you live,
just like I have told you to do.
22 Those who have done things that cause them to become unacceptable to God,
and those who have not done things like that, are all permitted to all eat that meat,
just like you would eat the meat of a deer or an antelope.
DEUTERONOMY 12:23
274
DEUTERONOMY 13:7
23 But be sure that you do not eat the blood of any animal, because it is the blood
that sustains life in living beings, and so you must not eat the life along with the meat.
25 If you obey this command and do what Yahweh says is right for you to do, things
26 “But the sacred offerings that Yahweh has told you to give and the other offerings
27 You must offer there the sacrifices that will be completely burned on Yahweh’s
altar. You must also offer there the sacrifices from which you may eat some of meat
after you kill the animals and drain out the blood and some of it is thrown on the
sides of the altar.
28 Faithfully obey all these things that I have commanded you. If you do that, things
will go well forever for you and your descendants, because you will be doing what
Yahweh our God says is right for you to do and what pleases him.
29 “When you enter the land that you will occupy, as you advance, Yahweh our God
will get rid of the people-groups that live there.
30 After he does that, be sure that you do not worship the gods that they have been
worshiping, because if you do that, you will be caught in the same trap that they
were caught in [MET]. Do not ask anyone about those gods, saying, ‘Tell me how they
worshiped their gods, in order that I can worship them also.’
31 Do not try to worship Yahweh our God like they have worshiped their gods,
because when they worship them, they do disgusting things, things that Yahweh hates.
The worst thing that they do is that they sacrifice their own children and burn them
on their altars.
32 “Be sure to do everything that I have commanded you to do. Do not add anything
to these commands, and do not take anything away from them.”

Moses warned them against idolatry
1 “Possibly there will be people among you who say that they are prophets.
They
may say that they are able to interpret the meaning of dreams or perform various
kinds of miracles [DOU].
2 They will say those things in order to induce/persuade you to worship gods that
you have never known about before. But even if what they predict happens,
3 do not pay attention to what they say. Yahweh our God will be testing you to find
out if you love him with all your inner being.
4 You must conduct your lives as Yahweh our God wants you to, and you must
revere him, and do what he tells you to do [MTY], and worship only him, and ◄be
faithful to/have a close relationship with► him.
5 “But you must execute anyone who falsely says that he is a prophet, or someone
who falsely says that he can interpret dreams, or who tells you to rebel against Yahweh
our God, who rescued your ancestors from being slaves in Egypt. People like that are
only wanting to cause you to stop conducting your lives as Yahweh has commanded
you to do. Execute them, to get rid of this evil among you.
6 It does not matter if even your brother or your daughter or your wife or some
close/dear friend secretly urges you, saying ‘Let’s worship other gods. They are gods
which you or your ancestors have never known about.

near you worship, or gods that groups who live far away worship.

to stop worshiping Yahweh our God, who rescued your ancestors from being slaves
in Egypt.
11 When they are executed, all the Israeli people will hear what happened, and they
will become afraid, and none of them will do such an evil thing again.
12 “When you are living in one of the towns in the land that Yahweh our God is
giving to you, you may hear
13 that some worthless people there among you [IDM] are deceiving the people of
their town, saying, ‘Let’s go and worship other gods,’ but they are gods that you have
never heard about before.
14 Investigate it thoroughly/carefully. If you find out that it is true that such a
disgraceful thing has happened,
15 kill all the people in that town. And kill all their livestock, too. Destroy the town
completely.
16 Gather all the possessions that belonged to the people who lived there and pile
them up in the city plaza. Then burn the town and everything in it, as though it were
an offering to Yahweh that would be completely burned on the altar. The ruins/ashes
must stay there forever; the town must never be rebuilt.
17 None of you Israelis must take for yourselves [IDM] anything that Yahweh has
said must be destroyed. But if you do what I say, Yahweh will stop being angry with
you, and he will act mercifully toward you. And he will cause you to have many
children/descendants, which is what he promised our ancestors that he would do.
18 Yahweh our God will do all those things if you do what he is telling you to do,
and if you obey all the commandments that I am giving to you today and do what
Yahweh says is right for you to do.”

Creatures that were forbidden to be eaten
1 “We are people who belong to Yahweh our God. So, when people die, do not show
that you are grieving by gashing/cutting yourselves or by shaving the hair on your
foreheads like the other people-groups do.
2 We belong to Yahweh alone. Yahweh chose us from all the other people-groups
on the earth to be his special people.
3 “Do not eat anything that Yahweh detests.
4 The animals whose meat you are permitted to eat are cattle, sheep, goats,
5 deer, gazelles, wild goats, antelopes, and mountain sheep.
6 Those are animals that have split hoofs and that also ◄chew their cuds/regurgitate
their food from their stomachs to chew it again►.
7 But there are other animals that chew their cuds that you must not eat. Those are
camels, rabbits, and rock badgers. They chew their cuds, but their hooves are not
split. So they are not acceptable for you to eat.
8 Do not eat pigs. They are unacceptable for you to eat; their hooves are split, but
they do not chew cud. Do not eat the meat of those animals; do not even touch their
dead bodies.
9 You are permitted to eat any fish that has scales and fins.
DEUTERONOMY 14:10
must not eat, because if you eat them, you will become unacceptable to Yahweh.
11 “You are permitted to eat the flesh of any bird that is acceptable to Yahweh.
12 But eagles, vultures, black vultures,
13 buzzards, all kinds of kites,
14 all kinds of crows,
15 ostriches, seagulls,
16 owls, hawks, falcons,
17 pelicans, vultures that eat dead animals, cormorants,
18 storks, herons, hoopoes, and bats, you must not eat.
19 “All insects with wings and which walk on the ground are unacceptable to Yahweh;
do not eat them.
20 But other insects with wings and which hop along the ground are acceptable to
eat.
21 “Do not eat any animal that has died naturally, because its blood has not been
drained out. You may allow foreigners who live among you to eat those things or you
may sell them to other foreigners. But you belong to Yahweh our God; and those who
belong to him are not permitted to eat the meat of animals whose blood has not been
drained out.
“You must not cook a young sheep or goat in its mother’s milk.”
Giving tithes
22 “Once each year you must set apart ◄a tithe/10 percent► of all the crops that are
produced/harvested in your fields.
23 Take those things to the place that Yahweh our God will choose for you to worship
him. There eat the tithes of your grain, your wine, your olive oil, and the meat of the
firstborn male animals of your cattle and your sheep. Do this in order that you may
learn to always revere Yahweh, the one who has blessed you by giving you these things.
24 If the place that Yahweh has chosen for you to worship him is very far from your
home, with the result that you are not able to take there the tithes of your crops with
which Yahweh has blessed you, do this:
25 Sell [IDM] the tithes of your crops, wrap the money carefully in a cloth, and take
it with you to the place of worship that Yahweh has chosen.
26 There, with that money, you may buy whatever you want to—beef or lamb or
wine or fermented drinks. And there, in the presence of Yahweh, you and your
families should eat and drink those things and be happy.
27 But be sure to not neglect/forget to help the descendants of Levi who live in your
towns, because they will not own any land.
28 “At the end of every three years, bring a tithe of all your crops that have been
produced/harvested in that year and store it in your towns.
29 That food is for the descendants of Levi, because they do not have their own
land, and for foreigners who live among you, and for orphans and widows who live
in your towns. They are permitted to come to where the food is stored and take what
they need. Do that in order that Yahweh our God will bless you in everything that
you do.”

The year for canceling debts
1 “At the end of every seven years, you must ◄cancel all debts/tell people who owe
you money that they do not need to pay it back►.
DEUTERONOMY 15:2
277
DEUTERONOMY 15:18
2 Do it like this:
Each of you who has lent money to a fellow Israeli must cancel
that debt. You must not insist that he pay it back. You must do that because Yahweh
has declared that the debts must be canceled every seven years.
3 During that year you may require foreigners who live among you to pay what they
owe you, but you must not try to require that any fellow Israeli pay you what he owes
you.
4-5 Yahweh our God will bless you in the land that he is giving to you. If you obey
Yahweh our God and obey all the commandments that I am giving to you today, there
will not be any poor people among you.
6 Yahweh our God will bless you like he has promised to do, and you will be able to
lend money to people of other people-groups, but you will not need to borrow from
any of them. You will control the finances of many people-groups, but they will not
control your finances.
7 “In the towns that Yahweh our God is giving to you, if there are any Israelis who
are poor, do not be selfish [IDM] and refuse [IDM] to help them.
8 Instead, be generous [IDM] and lend to them the money that they need.
9 Be sure that you do not say to yourself, ‘The year when debts will be canceled is
near, so I do not want to lend anyone any money now, because he will not need to pay
it back when that year comes.’ It would be evil to even think that. If you act in an
unfriendly way toward a needy fellow Israeli, and give him nothing, he will cry out
to Yahweh about you, and Yahweh will say that you have sinned by not helping that
person.
10 Give freely to poor people and give generously [IDM].
11 If you do that, Yahweh will bless you in everything that you do. There will always
be some poor people in your land, so I command you to give generously to poor [DOU]
people.”
Freeing slaves
12 “If any of your fellow Israeli men or women sell themselves to one of you to
become your slave, you must free them after they have worked for you for six years.
When the seventh year comes, you must free them.
13 When you free them, do not allow them to go ◄empty-handed/without giving
them anything►.
14 Give to them generously from the things with which Yahweh has blessed you—
sheep, grain, and wine.
15 Do not forget that your ancestors were once slaves in Egypt, and Yahweh our
God freed them. That is the reason that I am now commanding you to do this.
16 “But one of your slaves may say, ‘I do not want to leave you.’ He loves you and
your family, because you have treated him well.
17 If he says that, take him to the door of your house and, while he stands against
the doorway, pierce one of his earlobes with ◄an awl/a sharp pointed tool►. That

they served you for six years, and you paid them only half as much as you pay the
servants that you hire. If you free them, Yahweh our God will bless you in everything
that you do.”
Rules about sacrificing firstborn animals
DEUTERONOMY 15:19
278
DEUTERONOMY 16:11
19 “◄Set aside for/Dedicate to► Yahweh our God the firstborn male animals from
your cattle and sheep. Do not force them to do any work for you, and do not ◄shear/
cut off► the wool of the firstborn animals to sell the wool.
20 You and your family may kill them and eat their meat in the presence of Yahweh
at the place that Yahweh chooses for you to worship him.
21 But if the animals have any defects, if they are lame or blind, or if they have any
other serious defect, you must not sacrifice them to Yahweh our God.
22 You may kill and eat the meat of those animals at your homes. Those who have
done things that cause them to become unacceptable to God and those who have not
done such things are permitted to eat that meat, just like anyone is permitted to eat
the meat of a deer or an antelope.
23 But you must not eat any of the blood; you must drain all the blood on the ground
when you kill those animals.”
16
The Passover Festival
1 “Each year honor Yahweh our God by celebrating the Passover Festival in the
month of Abib in early spring. It was on a night in that month that Yahweh rescued
your ancestors from Egypt.
2 In order to celebrate that festival, go to the place that Yahweh will choose for you
to worship him, and offer there one young animal from your cattle or your sheep to
be the Passover sacrifice, to honor Yahweh [MTY].
3 When you eat the Passover meal, the bread that you eat must not have yeast in it.
You must eat this kind of bread, which will be called the bread of suffering/misery, for
seven days. This is to help you to remember all during the time that you are alive that
when your ancestors left Egypt, where they were suffering because they were slaves,
they left very quickly. They did not put in yeast and wait for the dough to swell up.
4 During that festival, you must not have any yeast in any house in your land for
seven days. Furthermore, the meat of the animals that you sacrifice on the evening
of the first day of the Passover Festival must be eaten during that night; do not allow
any of it to remain until the next day.
5-6 “To honor Yahweh our God, you must offer the Passover sacrifice only at the
town in the land that Yahweh is giving to you. Offer that sacrifice when the sun is

next morning, you may return to your tents.

bringing to him an offering of grain. Yahweh has blessed you by causing it to grow in
your fields during that year. If you had a big harvest, bring a big offering. If you had
a small harvest, bring a small offering.
11 Each married couple should be joyful in the presence of Yahweh. Their children,
their servants, the descendants of Levi who are in that town, and the foreigners,
DEUTERONOMY 16:12
279
DEUTERONOMY 17:4
orphans, and widows who are living among you, should also be joyful. Bring those
offerings to the place of worship that Yahweh will choose.
12 “When you celebrate these festivals by obeying these commands, remember that
your ancestors were previously slaves in Egypt.”
The Festival of Living in Shelters
13 “Each year, after you have threshed all your grain and pressed the juice from all
your grapes, you must celebrate the Festival of Living in Temporary Shelters for seven
days.
14 Each married couple along with their children, their servants, the descendants of
Levi who are in that town, and the foreigners, orphans, and widows who are living
among you, should be joyful in the presence of Yahweh.
15 Honor Yahweh our God by celebrating this festival for seven days in the place
that Yahweh chooses for you to worship him. You should all be joyful, because Yahweh
will have blessed your harvest and all the other work that you have done.
16 “So, each year all of you Israeli men must gather with your families to worship
Yahweh our God at the place that he will choose, to celebrate three festivals: The
Passover Festival, the Harvest Festival, and the Festival of Living in Temporary
Shelters. Each of you men must bring [LIT] an offering for Yahweh to these festivals
17 in proportion to the blessings that Yahweh has given you during that year.”
Judging people fairly
18 “Appoint judges and other officials throughout your tribes, in all the towns in the
land that Yahweh our God is giving to you. They must judge people fairly/justly.
19 They must not judge unjustly. They must not favor one person more than another.
The judges must not accept bribes, because if a judge accepts a bribe, even if he is
wise and honest, it will be very difficult for him to judge fairly [IDM]; he will do what
the person who gave him the bribe wants him to do and declare that the righteous/
innocent people must be punished.
20 You must be completely fair and just [DOU], in order that you will enter and
occupy the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you.”
Warning against worshiping other gods
21 “When you make an altar to worship Yahweh our God, do not put next to it any
wooden statue that represents the goddess Asherah.
22 And do not set up any stone pillar to worship any idol, because Yahweh hates
them.”
17
Warning against sacrificing defective animals
1 “Do not sacrifice to Yahweh our God any cattle or sheep or goats that have any
defects, because Yahweh hates that kind of gift.”
Punishment for idolatry
2 “When you are living in any of the towns in the land that Yahweh our God is giving
to you, suppose you hear that there is some man or woman who sins by disobeying
the agreement that Yahweh has made with you.
3 Suppose someone tells you that that person has worshiped and served other gods,
or the sun, or the moon, or the stars.
4 If you hear that some person has been doing that, you must investigate it
thoroughly. If you find out that it is true that this detestable thing has happened
in Israel,
5 you must take outside the town the man or woman who has done it.
Then you
must kill that person by throwing stones at him or her.
6 But you are allowed to execute such people only if at least two witnesses testify
that they saw them doing that. They must not be executed if there is only one witness.
7 The ◄witnesses/ones who saw them doing it► must be the first ones to throw
stones at them. Then the other people [MTY] should throw stones at them. By doing
that, you will get rid of this evil practice among you.”
Judging difficult cases
8 “Sometimes it will be very difficult for a judge to decide what really happened. He
might be trying to decide whether, when someone injured or killed another person,
he did it accidentally or deliberately. Or he might be trying to decide if some person
is suing another person unfairly. If in some town it is very difficult to know what
really happened, with the result that the judge cannot decide it, you should go to the
place that Yahweh our God has chosen for you to worship him.
9 There you should present the case to the descendants of Levi who are the priests,
and to the judge who is serving at that time, and they should decide what should be
done.
10 After they make their decision, you must do what they tell you to do.
11 Accept what they have decided, and do what they say that you should do. Do not
try to change in any way what they have decided [IDM].
12 You must execute anyone who proudly/arrogantly disobeys the judge or the priest
who stands there in the presence of Yahweh and decides what should be done. By doing
that, you will get rid of evil practices among you.
13 Then after that person is executed, all the people will hear about it, and they will
be afraid, and none of them will act that way any more.”
Proper behavior for a king
14 “I know that after you have occupied the land that Yahweh our God is giving to
you, and you are living there, you will say, ‘We should have a king to rule over us,
like the kings that other nations around us have.’
15 Yahweh our God will permit you to have a king, but be sure that you appoint
someone whom he has chosen. That man must be an Israeli; you must not appoint
someone who is a foreigner to be your king.
16 After he becomes the king, he should not acquire a large number of horses for
himself. He should not send people to Egypt to buy horses for him, because Yahweh
said to you, ‘Never return to Egypt for anything’!
17 And he must not have a lot of wives, because if he did that, they would turn him
[SYN] away from worshiping only Yahweh. And he must not acquire a lot of silver
and gold.
18 “When he becomes your king, he must appoint someone to copy these laws. He
must copy them from the scroll that is kept by the priests who are descended from
Levi.
19 He must keep this new scroll near him and read from it every day of his life, in
order that he may learn to revere Yahweh, and to faithfully obey [DOU] all the rules
and regulations that are written in these laws.
20 If he does that, he [SYN] will not think that he is ◄better/more important► than
[IDM] his fellow Israelis, and he will completely obey [LIT] Yahweh’s commands. As

What the priests were to receive
1 “The priests, who are all from the tribe of Levi, will not receive any land in Israel.
Instead, they will receive some of the food that other people offer to be burned on the
altar to be sacrificed to Yahweh and some of the other sacrifices that will be offered
to Yahweh.
2 They will not be allotted any land like the other tribes will be. What they will
they should have.
3 “When the people bring an ox or a sheep to be sacrificed, they must give to the
priests the shoulder, the cheeks/jaws, and the stomach of those animals.
4 You must also give to them the first part of the grain that you harvest, and the
first part of the wine that you make, and the first part of the olive oil that you make,
and the first part of the wool that you shear from your sheep.
5 You must do this because Yahweh our God has chosen the tribe of Levi from all of
your tribes, in order that men from that tribe would always be the priests who would
serve him.
6 “If any man from the tribe of Levi who has been living in one of the towns in Israel
living there,
7 he is permitted to serve Yahweh there as a priest, just like the other men from the
tribe of Levi who have been serving there.
8 He must be given the same amount of food that the other priests receive. He
is permitted to keep the money that his relatives give him for selling some of their
possessions.
A warning about pagan practices
9 When you enter the land that Yahweh our God is giving you, you must not imitate
the disgusting things that the people-groups who are there now do.
10 You must not sacrifice any of your children by burning them on your altars. Do
not practice ◄divination/using supernatural power to reveal what will happen in the
future►. Do not do/practice ◄soothsaying/magic to find out what will happen in the
future►. Do not ◄interpret omens/say that because of something that you have seen
you know what will happen►. Do not practice sorcery/witchcraft. Do not practice
◄putting spells on people/saying things to cause bad things to happen to others►.
11 Do not try to talk with spirits of dead people. Do not do/practice magic.
12 Yahweh hates people who do any of those disgusting things. And as you advance
through that land, he is going to expel the people-groups because they do/practice
those disgusting things.
13 But you must always avoid doing any of those things.
The promise to send a prophet like Moses
for you, Yahweh our God does not allow you to do that.
tell you what will happen in the future, and he is the one whom you must heed.
they pleaded with me saying, ‘We do not want Yahweh to speak [MTY] to us again, and
we do not want to see this huge fire that is burning on the mountain!’ Your ancestors
said that because they were afraid that they would die if Yahweh spoke to them again.
DEUTERONOMY 18:17
282
DEUTERONOMY 19:10
17 Then Yahweh said to me, ‘What they have said is true/wise.
18 So I will send from among them a prophet who will be like you.
I will tell him
what to say, and then he will tell people everything that I tell him to say.
19 He will speak for me. And I will punish anyone who does not heed what he says.
20 But if any other person says that he is a prophet and dares to speak a message
which he falsely says comes from me but which I did not tell him to speak, or if
anyone who speaks a message that he says other gods [MTY] have revealed to him,
he must be executed for doing that.’
21 But if you say to yourself, ‘How can we know if a message that someone tells us
does not come from Yahweh?’
22 The answer is that when someone speaks a message about what will happen in
the future, a message that he says was revealed by Yahweh, if what he says does not
happen, you will know that the message did not come from Yahweh. That person has
wrongly claimed that it was revealed to him by Yahweh. So you do not need to be
afraid of anything that he says.”
19
The cities of refuge
1 After Yahweh our God has gotten rid of the people-groups from the land that he
is giving to you, and after you have expelled them from their cities and you start to
2-3 you must divide into three parts the land that he is giving to you. Then choose
a city in each part. You must make good roads in order that people can get to those
cities easily. Someone who kills another person can escape to one of those cities to
be safe/protected.
4 “This is the rule about someone who has killed another person. If someone
◄accidentally/without planning to► kills another person who was not his enemy,
he may escape to one of those cities and be safe/protected there.
5 For example, if two men go into the forest to cut some wood, if the axe head comes
off the handle while one of them is chopping down a tree and the axe head strikes
and kills the other man, the man who was using the axe will be allowed to run to one
of those cities and be safe there, because the people of that city will protect him.
6 Because he accidentally killed someone, and because the man was not his enemy,
he can try to run to one of those cities. If there were only one city, it may be a long
distance to that city. Then if the relative of the man who was killed [MTY], the man
who is supposed/expected to get revenge, is very angry, he may be able to catch the
other person before he arrives at that city.
7 To prevent that from happening, you must choose three cities, not only one, in
order that someone can get to one of those cities quickly.
8-9 “If you do everything that I am today commanding you to do, and if you love
Yahweh our God, and if you conduct your lives as he wants you to do, Yahweh our
God will give you much more land than you will have when you first occupy it,
which is what he promised to do. He will give you all the land which he promised
your ancestors that he would give to you. When he gives you that land, you must
select three more cities to which people may escape.
10 Do this in order that people who ◄are innocent/have killed someone else without
planning to► will not die, and you will not be guilty for allowing them to be executed,
in the land that Yahweh is giving to you.
DEUTERONOMY 19:11
283
DEUTERONOMY 20:4
11 “But suppose someone hates his enemy and hides and waits for that person to
come along the road. Then when he passes by, suddenly he attacks him and murders
him. If the attacker flees to one of those cities to be protected there,
12 the elders of the city where the murdered man lived must not protect the attacker.
They. must send someone to the city to which the other man escaped, and bring him
to [MTY] the relative who is supposed/expected to get revenge, so that he may execute
that man.
13 You must not pity those who murder other people! Instead, you must execute
them, in order that the people in the land of Israel will not murder [MTY] innocent
people, and in order that things will go well for you.”
Warning against moving boundaries
14 “When you are living in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you, do not
move the markers of your neighbors’ property boundaries which were placed there
long ago.”
Warnings about witnesses
15 “If someone is accused of committing a crime, one ◄witness/person who says, ‘I
saw him do it’► is not enough. There must be at least two ◄witnesses/people who
what he says is true.
17 both of them must go to the place where the people worship, to talk to the priests
18 The judges must ◄investigate the case carefully/try to find out which one is telling
the truth►. If the judges determine that one of them has accused the other falsely,
19 that person must be punished in the same way that the other one would have
been punished if the judge decided that he ◄was guilty/had done what is wrong►. By
punishing such people, you will get rid of this evil practice among you.
20 And/ Because when that person is punished, everyone will hear what has
happened, and they will be afraid, and no one will dare to act that way any more.
21 You must not pity people who are punished like that. The rule should be that
a person who has murdered someone else must be executed; one of a person’s eyes
must be gouged out if he has gouged out someone else’s eye, one tooth of a person
who has knocked out the tooth of another person must be knocked out; one hand of
a person who has cut off the hand of another person must likewise be cut off; one
foot of a person who has cut off the foot of another person must also be cut off.”

Rules concerning fighting wars
1 “When your soldiers go to fight your enemies, and you see that they have many
of them, because Yahweh our God, who brought your ancestors safely out of Egypt,
2 When you are ready to start the battle, the Supreme Priest must stand in front of
the troops.
3 He must say to them, ‘You Israeli men, listen to me! Today you are going to fight
against your enemies. Do not be timid or afraid [DOU] or tremble or panic [DOU],
4 because Yahweh our God will go with you. He will fight your enemies for you,
and he will enable you to defeat them.’
DEUTERONOMY 20:5
284
DEUTERONOMY 21:3
5 Then the army officers must say to the troops, ‘If anyone among you has just built
a new house [RHQ] and has not dedicated it to God, he should go home and dedicate
the house. If he does not do that, if he dies in the battle, someone else will dedicate
the house and live in it.
6 If anyone among you has planted a vineyard and has not yet harvested any grapes
from it [RHQ], he should go home. If he stays here and dies in the battle, someone
else will harvest the grapes and enjoy the wine made from them.
7 If anyone among you has become engaged to marry a woman but has not married
her yet [RHQ], he should go home. If he stays here and dies in the battle, someone
else will marry her.’
8 “Then the officers must also say, ‘If anyone among you is afraid or timid [RHQ],
he should go home, in order that he does not cause his fellow soldiers to also stop
being courageous.’
9 And when the officers have finished speaking to the troops, they must appoint
commanders to lead the groups of soldiers.
10 “When you come near a city that is far away to attack it, first tell the people there
that if they surrender, you will not attack them.
to work for you.
your troops must surround the city and break through the walls.
13 Then, when Yahweh our God enables you to capture [IDM] the city, you must kill
all the men in the city.
14 But you are allowed to take for yourselves the women, the children, the livestock,
and everything else that you want to take from the city. You will be allowed to enjoy
all the things that belonged to your enemies; it is Yahweh our God who has given
those things to you.
15 You should do that in all the cities that are far from the land in which you will
settle.
16 “But in the cities that are in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you, you
must kill all the people and all the animals [LIT].
17 You must get rid of them completely. Get rid of the Heth people-group, the Amor
people-group, the Canaan people-group, the Periz people-group, the Hiv people-group,
and the Jebus people-group; that is what Yahweh our God commanded you to do.
18 If you do not do that, they will teach you to sin against Yahweh our God and do
the disgusting things that they do when they worship their gods.
19 “When you surround a city for a long time, trying to capture it, do not cut down
the fruit trees outside the city. You are allowed to eat the fruit from the trees, but do
not get rid of the trees, because they certainly are not [RHQ] your enemies.
20 You are permitted to cut down the other trees and use the wood to make ladders
and towers to enable you to go over the walls and capture the city.”
21
When no one knows who murdered someone
1 “Suppose someone has been murdered in a field in the land that Yahweh our God
is giving to you, and you do not know who killed that person.
2 If that happens, your elders and judges must go out to where that person’s corpse
was found and measure the distance from there to each of the nearby towns.
3 Then the elders in the town that is closest to where the corpse was found must
select a young cow that has never been used for doing work.
DEUTERONOMY 21:4
285
DEUTERONOMY 21:20
4 They must take it to a place near a stream where the ground has never been
plowed or planted. They must break its neck there in that valley.
5 The priests must go there also, because Yahweh our God has chosen them from
the tribe of Levi to serve him and to be his representatives [MTY] when they bless
people. And he has also chosen them to settle disputes in which someone has been
injured.
6 The elders from the closest town must wash their hands over the young cow whose
neck was broken,
7 and they must say, ‘We did not murder this person [MTY], and we did not see who
did it.
not consider ◄us to be guilty/that we should be punished because► of murdering
us.’
not be considered to be guilty for murdering that person.”
The rule about marrying women who are captured
10 “When you soldiers go to fight against your enemies, and Yahweh our God enables
you to defeat them [IDM], and ◄they become your prisoners/you capture them►,
11 one of you may see among them a beautiful woman that he likes, and he may
want to marry her.
12 He should take her to his home, and there she must shave all the hair off her head
and cut her fingernails to signify that now she does not belong to her people-group any
more, but instead she is becoming an Israeli.
13 She must take off the clothes that she was wearing when she was captured, and
put on Israeli clothes. She must stay in that man’s house and mourn for a month
because of leaving her parents. After that, he will be allowed to marry her.
14 Later, if he no longer is pleased with her, he will be permitted to allow her to
leave him. But because she was forced to have sex with him, he will not be allowed
to treat her like a slave and sell her to someone else.”
The oldest son’s inheritance
15 “Suppose that a man has two wives, but he likes one of them and dislikes the
other one. And suppose that they both give birth to sons, and the oldest son is the
child of the woman that he does not like.
16 On the day when that man decides how he will divide his possessions for his
sons to possess after he dies, he must not favor the son of the wife that he loves by
giving him a bigger share, the share that the older son should receive.
17 He must give to the older son, the son of the wife whom he does not like, twice
as much of his possessions. That son is his firstborn son, and he must be given the
share that he should receive because of his being that man’s firstborn son.”
A rebellious son
18 “Suppose there is a boy who is very stubborn and always ◄rebelling against/
disobeying► his parents, and who will not heed what they say to him. And suppose
that they punish him but he still does not pay attention to what they tell him [MTY].
19 If that happens, his parents must take him to the ◄gate of/central meeting place
in► the city where he lives and have him stand in front of the elders of the city.
20 Then the parents must say to the elders of that city, ‘This son of ours is stubborn
and always rebelling against us. He will not pay attention to what we tell him [MTY].
He wastes a lot of money (OR, eats too much food) and gets drunk.’
DEUTERONOMY 21:21

DEUTERONOMY 22:15
21 Then all the elders of that city must execute him by throwing stones at him. By
doing that, you will get rid of this evil practice among you. And everyone in Israel
Burying criminals
22 “If someone is executed for having committed a crime for which he deserves to
die, and you hang his corpse on a post,
23 you must not allow his corpse to remain there all night. You must bury it on the
day that he died, because God has cursed anyone whose corpse is allowed to remain
on a post. You must bury the corpse that day, in order that you do not defile the land
that Yahweh our God is giving to you.”
22
Various other laws
1 “If you see some Israeli’s ox or sheep that has strayed away, do not act as though
you did not see it. Take it back to its owner.
2 But if the owner does not live near you, or if you do not know who the owner is,
take the animal to your house. It can stay with you until the owner comes, searching
for it. Then you must give the animal to him.
3 You must do the same thing if you see a donkey, or a piece of clothing, or anything
else that someone has lost. Do not refuse to do what you should do.
4 “And if you see a fellow Israeli’s donkey or cow that has fallen down on the road,
do not act as though you did not see it. Help the owner to lift the animal up so that
it can stand on its feet again.
5 “Women must not wear men’s clothes, and men must not wear women’s clothes.
Yahweh our God hates people who do things like that.
6 “If you happen to find a bird’s nest in a tree or on the ground, and the mother
bird is sitting in the nest on its eggs or with the baby birds, do not take the mother
bird and kill it.
7 You are permitted to take the baby birds, but you must allow the mother bird to
fly away. Do this in order that things will go well for you and that you will live for a
long time.
8 “If you build a new house, you must put a ◄railing/low wall► around the edge of
the roof. If you do that, and if someone falls off the roof and dies, ◄you will not be
guilty of causing that person to die/his death [MTY] will not be your fault►.
9 “Do not plant any crop in the area where your grapevines are growing. If you
do, you are not allowed to harvest the crops that you have planted or to harvest the
grapes to make wine from them.

different kinds of thread►.

corners of your cloak.
Rules concerning sex
13 “Suppose a man marries a young woman and has sex with her and later decides
that he does not want her any more,
14 and he says false things about her, and claims that she was not a virgin when he
married her.
15 If that happens, the young woman’s parents must take the sheet that was on the
bed when that man and their daughter were married, which still has bloodstains on

16 Then the father of the young woman must say to the elders, ‘I gave my daughter
to this man to be his wife. But now he says that he doesn’t want her any more.
17 And he has falsely said that she was not a virgin when he married her. But look!
Here is what proves that my daughter was a virgin! Look at the bloodstains on the
sheet where they slept the night that they were married!’ And he will show the sheet
to the elders.
18 Then the elders of that city must take that man and whip him.
19 They shall require that he pay a fine of 100 pieces of silver and give the money
to the father of the young woman, because the man caused an Israeli young woman
to be disgraced. Also, that woman must continue to live with him; she is his wife. He
is not allowed to divorce her during the rest of his life.
virgin when he married her,
21 they must take that young woman to the door of her father’s house. Then the
men of that city must execute her by throwing stones at her. They must do that
because she has done something in Israel that is very disgraceful, by having sex with
some man while she was still living in her father’s house. By executing her like that,
you will get rid of this evil practice among you.
22 “If a man is caught while he is having sex with another man’s wife, both of them
must be executed. By doing that, you will get rid of this evil practice in Israel.
23 “Suppose in some town a man sees a young woman who is engaged/promised to
24 You must take both of them to the ◄gate of/central meeting place in► that town.
There you must execute them both by throwing stones at them. You must execute
the young woman because she did not shout for help even though she was in the

25 “But suppose out in the open countryside a man meets a young woman who is
engaged/promised to be married, and he rapes her. If that happens, only that man
must be executed.
26 You must not punish the young woman, because she did not do anything for
which she deserves to be executed. This case is like when one man attacks another
man in the countryside and murders him,
27 because the man who raped her saw her when she was in the open countryside,
and even though she called out for help, there was no one there who could rescue
her.
28 “If a man rapes a young woman who is not engaged/promised to be married, if
someone sees him while he is doing that,

marry her, because he forced her to have sex with him. He is not allowed to divorce

2 “No ◄illegitimate person/person whose mother and father were not married►,

one of Yahweh’s people.
3 “No one from the Ammon or Moab people-groups shall be ◄included as one of/
allowed to worship with► Yahweh’s people, extending to the tenth generation.
4 One reason is that their leaders refused to give your ancestors food and water
when they were traveling from Egypt to Canaan. Another reason is that they wanted
to pay Balaam, the son of Beor from Pethor town in Mesopotamia, to curse you Israelis.
5 But Yahweh our God did not pay attention to Balaam; instead, he caused Balaam
to bless your ancestors, because Yahweh loved them.
6 As long as Israel is a nation, you must not do anything to cause things to go well
for those two people-groups or enable them to prosper.
7 “But do not despise anyone from the Edom people-group, because they are
descendants of your ancestor Jacob, just like you are. And do not despise people
from Egypt, because they treated your ancestors well when they first lived in Egypt.
8 The children and grandchildren of people from Edom and Egypt who live among
you may be ◄included among/allowed to worship with► Yahweh’s people.”
Keeping the camp clean
9 “When your soldiers are living in tents at a time of fighting your enemies, they
must avoid doing things that would make them unacceptable to God.

that day.
11 But in the evening of that day, he must bathe himself, and at sunset he is allowed
to come back into the camp.
12 “Your soldiers must have a toilet area outside the camp where you can go when
you need to.
13 When you go to fight against your enemies, carry a stick along with your weapons,
in order that when you need to defecate [EUP], you can dig a hole with the stick, and
then cover up the hole when you have finished defecating.
14 You must keep the camp acceptable to Yahweh our God, because he is with you
in your camp to protect you and to enable you to defeat your enemies. Do not do
anything disgraceful/indecent that would cause Yahweh to abandon you.”
Various other laws

DEUTERONOMY 24:12
21 “When you vow to give something to Yahweh your God or to do something for
him, do it as soon as you can. Yahweh expects you to do what you promised, and if
you do not do it, you will be committing a sin.
22 But if you [SYN] do not vow to do something, that is not sinful.
23 But if you voluntarily promise to do something, you must do it.

Laws about divorcing and remarrying
1 “Suppose a man marries a woman and later decides that he does not want her
because there is something about her that he doesn’t like. And suppose he writes
on paper that he is divorcing her, and he gives the paper to her [SYN] and sends her
away from his house.
2 Then suppose that she goes and marries another man,
3 and that man later also decides that he does not like her, and he also writes on
paper that he is divorcing her, and he sends her away from his house. Or, suppose
that the second husband dies.
4 If either of those things happens, her first husband must not marry her again. He
must consider that she has become unacceptable to Yahweh. Yahweh would consider
it to be disgusting if he married her again. You must not sin [MTY] by doing that in
the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you.”
Various laws

to marry me in order that I may give birth to a son who will prevent my dead husband’s
name from disappearing in Israel.’
8 Then the elders must summon that man and talk to him. If he still refuses to
marry that widow,
9 she must go up to him while the elders are watching, and take off one of his
sandals to symbolize/show that he would not receive any of her property, and spit in
his face, and say to him, ‘This is what happens to the man who refuses to do what
is needed to allow his dead brother to have a son in order that our family name does
not disappear.’
10 After that happens, that man’s family will be known as ‘the family of the man
whose sandal was pulled off’.
Two other laws
11 When two men are fighting with each other, and the one man’s wife comes near
to help her husband by grabbing hold of the other man’s genitals,
12 do not act mercifully toward her; cut off her hand.
13-14 “When you are buying or selling things, do not try to cheat people by having
use when you sell something, and two kinds of measuring baskets, one which you use
15 Always use correct weights and correct measuring baskets, in order that Yahweh
our God will allow you to live a long time in the land that he is giving to you.
16 Yahweh hates all those who act dishonestly, and he will punish them.
Getting revenge on the Amalek people-group
17 Continue to remember what the Amalek people-group did to your ancestors when
they were coming out of Egypt.
18 They attacked your ancestors as your ancestors were traveling, when they were
weak and exhausted. Those people were not afraid of God at all, so they attacked
your ancestors from the rear and killed all those who were unable to walk as fast as
the others.
19 Therefore, when Yahweh our God has given you the land that he promised to give
you, and when he has enabled you to rest from fighting all your enemies around you,
kill all the Amalek people-group, with the result that no one will remember them any
more. Do not forget to do this!”

Offerings at harvest time
1 “After you occupy the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you, and you ◄have
settled/are living► there,
2 each of you must take some of the first crops that you harvest, put them in a
basket, and take them to the place that Yahweh will have chosen for you to worship
[MTY] there.
3 Go to the Supreme Priest who is serving at that time and say to him, ‘By giving
you this first part of my harvest today, I am declaring to Yahweh our God that I have
picked it in the land that he vowed to our ancestors to give to us.’
DEUTERONOMY 26:4
292
DEUTERONOMY 26:19
4 Then the priest must take the basket of food from your hand and put it on the
altar where sacrifices are offered to Yahweh our God.
5 Then in Yahweh’s presence you must say this: ‘My ancestor Jacob was a man from
Aram/Syria who was continually wandering from one place to another. He took his
family to Egypt. They were a small group when they went there, but they lived there
and their descendants became a very large/populous [DOU] and powerful nation.
6 Then the people of Egypt treated them very harshly [DOU], and they forced them
to become their slaves and to work very hard.
7 Then our ancestors cried out to you, Yahweh our God, and you heard them. You
saw that they were suffering, and that they were forced to work very hard, and were
8 Then by your great power [MTY] and by performing many kinds of miracles [DOU],
9 You brought us to this land and gave it to us, a land that is very fertile [IDM].
land that I received.’ Then you must set the basket down in Yahweh’s presence and
worship him there.
11 And you must celebrate by eating a meal together to thank Yahweh our God for
all the good things that he has given to you and to your family. And you must invite
the descendants of Levi and the foreigners who are living among you to also rejoice
and eat with you.
The tithes
12 Every third year, you must bring to the descendants of Levi and to the foreigners
who are living among you and the orphans and the widows ◄a tithe/10 percent► of
your crops, in order that in every town they will have plenty to eat.
13 Then you must say to Yahweh, ‘I have brought to you, from my house, all of the
sacred tithe from my harvest this year. I am giving it to the descendants of Levi, to
the foreigners, the orphans, and the widows, as you commanded us to do. I have not
disobeyed any of your commands about the tithes, and I have not forgotten any of
your commands about tithes.
14 I declare that I have not eaten any food from the tithe while I was mourning for
someone who died. And I have not touched any of it while I was unacceptable to you;
I have not offered any of it to spirits of dead people. Yahweh, I have obeyed you and
done everything that you have commanded us concerning the tithe.
15 So please look down from your holy place in heaven, and bless us, your Israeli
people. Also bless this very fertile [IDM] land which you have given to us, which is
what you promised our ancestors that you would do.’
Yahweh’s own people
16 Today Yahweh our God is commanding you to obey all these rules and regulations.
So obey them faithfully, with your entire inner being [DOU].
17 Today you have declared that Yahweh is your God, and that you will conduct
your lives as he wants you to do, and that you will obey all his commands and rules
and regulations, and that you will do all that he tells you to do.
18 And today Yahweh has declared that you are his people, which is what he
promised that you would be, and he commands you to obey all his commands.
19 If you do that, he will cause you to become greater than any other nation that he
has established, and he will enable you to praise him and honor him [DOU]. You will
truly belong to Yahweh our God, which is what he has promised.”

The stone tablets set up on Ebal Mountain
1 Moses/I, along with the other Israeli leaders, said this to the people: “Obey all the
commandments that I am giving to you today.
2-4 Soon you will cross the Jordan River and enter the land that Yahweh, the God
[IDM] land on the west side of the Jordan River, set up some large stones on Ebal
teachings/instructions.
stones with iron tools.
6 The altar that you make to burn sacrifices to Yahweh our God must be made with
uncut stones.
7 And there you must sacrifice offerings to maintain fellowship with Yahweh, and
you must eat your share of those offerings and rejoice/celebrate in the presence of
Yahweh.
8 And, when you write these laws on those stones, you must write them very
clearly.”
9 Then Moses/I, along with the priests, said to all the Israeli people, “You Israeli
people, be quiet and listen to what I am saying. Today you have become the people
who belong to Yahweh, our God.
10 So, you must do what he tells you, and obey all the rules and regulations that I
am giving to you today.”
The curses from disobeying God
11 On that same day Moses/I said to the Israeli people,
12 “After you have crossed over the Jordan River, the tribes of Simeon, Levi, Judah,
Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin must stand on Gerizim Mountain and request Yahweh
13 And the tribes of Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali must stand
people.
14 The descendants of Levi must shout these words loudly:
15 ‘Yahweh will curse anyone who makes an idol of stone, or of wood, or of metal,
and secretly sets it up and worships it.
Yahweh considers that those things, made by humans [SYN], are detestable/
disgusting.’
And all the people must reply, ‘◄Amen/We want that to happen►.’
16 ‘Yahweh will curse anyone who dishonors his father or his mother.’
And all the people must reply, ‘◄Amen/We want that to happen►.’
17 ‘Yahweh will curse anyone who removes someone else’s markers of property
boundaries.’
And all the people must reply, ‘◄Amen/We want that to happen►.’
18 ‘Yahweh will curse anyone who leads a blind person to go ◄in the wrong direction/
where that person does not want to go►.’
And all the people must reply, ‘◄Amen/We want that to happen►.’
19 ‘Yahweh will curse anyone who deprives foreigners or orphans or widows of the
things that the laws state must be done for them.’
And all the people must reply, ‘◄Amen/We want that to happen►.’

22 ‘Yahweh will curse anyone who has sex with his sister or with his half-sister.’
23 ‘Yahweh will curse anyone who has sex with [EUP] his mother-in-law.’
24 ‘Yahweh will curse anyone who secretly murders someone else.’
25 ‘Yahweh will curse anyone who accepts a bribe to murder someone who ◄is
innocent/has not done something that is wrong.►’
And all the people must reply, ‘◄Amen/We want that to happen►.’
26 ‘Yahweh will curse anyone who disobeys these laws and refuses to declare that
these laws are good.’
And all the people must reply, ‘◄Amen/We want that to happen►.’ ”

The blessings from obeying God
1 “If you do what Yahweh our God tells you to do and faithfully obey everything
that I am today commanding you to do, he will cause you to become greater than any
other nation on the earth.
2 If you obey Yahweh, this is what he will do to bless you:
3 He will bless everything that you do when you are in the cities
and he will bless everything that you do when you are working in the fields.
4 He will bless you by giving you many children [IDM] and by giving you abundant
crops, and plenty of cattle and sheep.
5 He will bless you by causing you to have good harvests with plenty of grain
[MTY] to make bread.
6 He will bless you everywhere—when you go out of your houses and when you
come into your houses.
7 Yahweh will enable you to defeat the armies of your enemies;
they will attack you from one direction, but they will run away from you in seven/
many directions.
8 Yahweh will bless you by filling your barns with grain, and he will bless all the
work that you do;
he will bless you in the land that he is giving to you.
9 “If you obey all the commandments that Yahweh our God has given to you and
if you conduct your lives as he wants you to do, you will continue to be his people,
which is what he promised.
10 “When all the people-groups on the earth will realize that you belong to [MTY]
Yahweh, and they will be afraid of you.
11 “And Yahweh will cause you to prosper very much. He will give you many
children [IDM], many cattle, and abundant crops in the land that he vowed to our
ancestors that he would give to you.
12 “When rain is needed, Yahweh will send it from where he stores it in the sky,
and he will bless all your work, with the result that you will be able to lend money to
many other nations, but you will not need to borrow money from them.

The curses from disobeying God
15 But if you do not do what Yahweh our God is telling you to do, and if you do not
faithfully obey all his rules and regulations that I am giving to you today, this is what
he will do to curse you:
16 He will curse you when you are in the cities
and he will curse you when you are working in the fields.
17 He will curse you by not allowing you to have good harvests with plenty of
grain [MTY] to make bread.
18 He will curse you by giving you only a few children [IDM], by causing you to
have poor crops, and by not enabling you to have many cattle and sheep.
19 He will curse you everywhere—when you go out of your houses and when you
come into your houses.
20 If you do evil things and reject Yahweh,
he will curse you by causing you to ◄be confused/not know what to do►, and to
be frustrated in everything that you do,
until your enemies quickly and completely destroy you {you will be quickly and
completely destroyed}.
21 Yahweh will cause you to experience terrible diseases,
until not one of you remains alive in the land that you are about to enter and
occupy.
22 Yahweh will strike/afflict you with diseases that shrivel your bodies, with fever,
with inflammation/swelling.
It will be extremely hot, and it will not rain.
There will be scorching winds, and Yahweh will cause your crops to rot.
All these things will strike you until you die.
23 There will be no rain [MET], with the result that the ground will be as hard as
iron [MET].
24 Instead of sending rain, Yahweh will send strong winds to blow sand and dust
over your land, until your land is ruined.
25 Yahweh will enable your enemies to defeat you;
your soldiers will attack your enemies from one direction, but they will run away
from your enemies in seven/many directions,
and when the people of other nations see what is happening to you, they will say
that it is horrible.
26 You will die, and birds and wild animals will come and eat your corpses,
and there will not be anyone to scare/shoo them away.
27 Yahweh will cause you to have boils on your skin, like he caused the people of
Egypt to have many years ago.
He will cause you to have tumors, open sores, and your skin will itch, and there
will be nothing that will cure those diseases.
28 Yahweh will cause some of you to become insane; he will cause some of you to
become blind, and he will cause some of your minds to become confused.
29 Because you will not be able to see where you are going, at midday you will
◄grope/feel your way► around with your hands, like people do in the darkness.
You will continually be oppressed and robbed, and no one will help you.

someone else will rape her.
You will build houses, but you will never live in them.
You will plant grapevines, but you will not eat the grapes; someone else will eat
them.
31 Your enemies will butcher your cattle while you watch them, and you will not
get any of the meat to eat.
They will drag away your donkeys while you watch them do it, and they will not
give them back to you.
They will take away your sheep; and no one will help you rescue them.
32 While you watch, your sons and daughters will be given to foreigners to become
their slaves. Every day you will very sadly watch for your children to return, but
◄you will watch in vain/they will never return►.
33 People from a foreign nation will take all the crops that you worked hard to
produce,
and they will constantly treat you harshly and cruelly [DOU].
34 The result will be that all these terrible things that you see/experience will
cause you to become insane.
35 Yahweh will cause your legs to be covered with painful boils that cannot be
healed,
and you will have boils from the bottoms of your feet to the tops of your heads.
36 Yahweh will cause your king and the rest of you to be taken to another country,
to a place in which you and your ancestors have never lived before,
and there you will worship and serve gods that are made of wood or stone.
37 When the people-groups in nearby countries see what has happened to you,
they will be shocked/horrified;
38 You will plant plenty of seeds in your fields, but you will reap only a small
39 You will plant grapevines and take care of them, but you will not pick any
grapes to make wine, because worms will eat the vines.
40 Olive trees will grow everywhere in your land, but you will not get any olive
oil to rub on your skin because the olives will drop on the ground before they are
ripe.
41 You will have sons and daughters, but they will not stay with you, because they
will be captured and taken away.
42 Swarms of locusts/insects will eat your crops and the leaves of all your trees.
43 Foreigners who live in your land will become more and more powerful, and
you will become less and less powerful.
44 They will have money to lend to you, but you will not have any money to lend
to them.
They will be superior [IDM] to you, and you will be inferior to them [IDM].

you until you are destroyed, if you do not do what Yahweh your God told you to do,

You will be hungry and thirsty; you will not have clothes to wear; and you will lack
everything else that you need. And Yahweh will cause you to become slaves [MET]
and work hard until he gets rid of you.
49 “Yahweh will cause an army from very far away [HYP] to attack you, whose
soldiers speak a language that you do not know/understand. They will swoop down
on you quickly like an eagle [SIM] attacks its prey.
50 They will be fierce looking. They will not act mercifully toward anyone, not even
young children and old people.
51 They will kill and eat your livestock, and they will eat your crops, and you will
◄starve/die because you do not have anything to eat►. They will not leave for you
any grain or wine or olive oil or cattle or sheep; and you will all die from hunger.
52 Your enemies will surround your towns throughout the land that Yahweh your
God is about to give to you, and they will break down the high and strong walls
around your towns, walls which you trusted/thought would protect you.
53 “When your enemies are surrounding your towns, you will be extremely hungry,
with the result that you will eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters that Yahweh
your God has given to you.
54-55 When your enemies have surrounded your towns, even the most gentle and
sensitive men among you will want food very desperately, with the result that they
will kill their own children and eat their flesh, because they will not have anything
else to eat. They will not even share any of it with their brothers or wives whom they
love very much or with any of their children who are still alive.
56-57 Even the most gentle and sensitive/kind women among you, who are very
refined/rich with the result that they have never had to walk anywhere [HYP], will
do the same thing. When your enemies have surrounded your towns, those women
will be extremely hungry, with the result that after they give birth to a baby, they
will secretly kill it and eat its flesh and also eat its afterbirth. And they will not share
any of it with their husbands whom they love very much or with any of their other
children.
58 “If you do not faithfully obey all of the laws that I am writing, and if you do not
revere Yahweh our glorious God [MTY],
59 he will punish you by causing you and your descendants to experience great
afflictions and plagues which will last for many years.
60 He will cause you to experience the plagues that he sent on the people of Egypt,
and you will never be healed.
61 He will also cause you to experience many other sicknesses and diseases that I
have not talked about in these laws, until you all will die.
62 You became as numerous as the stars in the sky, but only a few of you will remain
alive, if you do not obey Yahweh your God.
63 Yahweh was very happy to do good things for you and to cause you to become
very numerous, but now he will be happy to ruin you and get rid of you. Those of
you who do not die from these plagues will be snatched away from the land that you
will soon be entering to possess.

see, each morning you will say ‘I wish it were evening already!’ and each evening
you will say ‘I wish it were morning already!’
68 Yahweh will send some of you back to Egypt in ships, even though he promised
that you would never be forced to go there again. There in Egypt you will try to sell
yourselves to become slaves of your enemies in order to have food to eat, but no one
will buy you. All those things will happen to you if you do not obey the laws that
Yahweh is giving to you.”

The agreement made in Moab
1 These are the things that the Israelis were required to do to keep the agreement
that Yahweh was making with them. Moses/ I commanded them to keep this
agreement when they/we were in the Moab region on the east side of the Jordan River.
This was in addition to the agreement that Yahweh had made with them/us at Sinai
Mountain.
2 Moses/I summoned all the Israeli people and said to them, “You saw [SYN] for
yourselves what Yahweh did to the king of Egypt and to his officials and to his entire
country.
3 You [SYN] saw all the plagues that Yahweh caused them to experience, and all the
various miracles [DOU] that Yahweh performed.
4 But until now, Yahweh has not enabled you to understand the meaning of all that
you have seen and heard.
5 For 40 years Yahweh has led you while you traveled/walked through the desert.
During that time, your clothes and your sandals have not worn out.
6 You did not have bread to eat or wine or other fermented/strong drinks to drink,
but Yahweh took care of you, in order that you would know that he is your God.
7 “And when we came to this place, Sihon, the king who ruled in Heshbon city, and
Og, the king who ruled the Bashan region, came with their armies to attack us, but
we defeated them.
8 We took/conquered their land and divided it among the tribes of Reuben and Gad,
and half of the tribe of Manasseh.
9 “So faithfully keep all of this agreement, in order that you will be successful in
everything that you do.
10 Today all of us are standing in the presence of Yahweh our God. The leaders of
all our tribes, our elders, our officials, all you Israeli men,
11 your wives, your children, and the foreigners who live among you and cut wood
for you and carry water for you, are here.
13 He is making this agreement with you in order to confirm that you are his people,
he vowed to give to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
14 This agreement is not only with you.
15 He is making this agreement with us who are here today and also with our
descendants who are not yet born.
16 “You remember the things that our ancestors suffered in Egypt, and how they
traveled through the land that belonged to other nations after they came out of Egypt.
DEUTERONOMY 29:17
299
DEUTERONOMY 30:3
17 In those countries they saw those disgusting idols made of wood and stone and
decorated with silver and gold.
18 So be sure that no man or woman or family or tribe that is here today turns away
from Yahweh our God, to worship/serve the gods of those nations. Doing that would
be like a root of a plant that would grow among you and bear poisonous and bitter
fruit [MET].
19 “Be sure that no one here today who hears this agreement thinks, ‘Everything
will go well with me, even if I stubbornly do what I want to.’ If you are stubborn like
that, the result will be that Yahweh will eventually get rid of all of you, both good
people and evil people [MET].
20 Yahweh will not forgive anyone who is stubborn like that. Instead, he will be
extremely angry [DOU] with that person, and that person will experience all the
curses that I have told you about, until Yahweh gets rid of that person and his family
[IDM].
21 From all the tribes of Israel, Yahweh will separate that individual. Yahweh will
cause him to experience all the disasters that I have listed in the agreement that states
the things that Yahweh will do to curse those who disobey the laws that I have written
in this scroll/book.
22 “In the future, your descendants and people from other countries will see the
disasters and the illnesses that Yahweh has caused to happen to you.
23 They will see that all your land has been ruined by burning sulfur and salt.
Nothing will have been planted. Not even weeds will grow there. Your land will
resemble Sodom and Gomorrah cities, and Admah and Zeboiim cities, which Yahweh
24 And the people from those other nations will ask, ‘Why did Yahweh do this to
25 “Then other people will reply, ‘It is because they refused to keep the agreement
he brought them out of Egypt.
26 Instead, they served/worshiped other gods that they had never worshiped before,
gods that Yahweh had told them not to worship.
27 So, Yahweh became very angry with the Israeli people in this land, and he caused
them to experience all the disasters that their leader warned them about.
28 Yahweh became extremely angry [DOU] with them and took/yanked them [MET]
out of their land and banished them into another land, and they are still there.’
29 “There are some things that Yahweh our God has ◄kept secret/not revealed►, but
he has revealed his laws to us, and he expects us and our descendants to obey them
forever.”
Bringing them back to Israel
1 “I have now told you about the ways that Yahweh our God will bless you if you
obey him and the ways that he will curse you if you disobey him. I am saying that you
must choose which you want. But when you choose not to obey his laws, some day you
will be living in the countries to which he will scatter you, and you will remember
what I told you.
2 Then, if you return to Yahweh our God and faithfully [IDM] obey all that I have
today commanded you to do,
3 he will be merciful to you. He will bring you back from the nations to which he
scattered you, and he will cause you to be prosperous again.

300
DEUTERONOMY 30:20
4 Even if you have been scattered to the most distant places on the earth, Yahweh
our God will gather you from there and bring you back to your land.
5 He will enable you to possess again the land where your ancestors lived. And he
will cause you to be more prosperous and more numerous than you are now.
6 Yahweh our God will change [MET] your inner beings, with the result that you
will love him more than you love anything else and want to do only what he wants
you to do. And then you will continue to live in that land.
7 Yahweh our God will cause your enemies and those who oppressed/persecuted
you to experience all the disasters that I have told you about.
8 You will do what Yahweh wants you to do, as you did before, and you will obey
all the commands that I have given to you today.
9 Yahweh our God will cause you to be very successful in all that you do. You will
have many children [IDM], and a lot of cattle, and you will have abundant crops. He
will again be happy to enable you to prosper, just like he was happy to enable your
ancestors to prosper.
10 But he will do those things only if you do what he has told you to do, and if you
obey all his rules and regulations that I have written about in this scroll, and if you
will love him more than you love anything else and want to do only what he wants
you to do.
Choose life, not death
11 The commands that I am giving to you today are not very difficult for you to
obey, and they are not difficult to know.
12 They are not in heaven, with the result that you need to say, ‘◄Who will need to
go up to heaven for us to bring them down here to us in order that we can hear them
and obey them?/Someone will need to go up to heaven for us to bring them down
here to us in order that we can hear them and obey them.►’ [RHQ]
13 And they are not on the other side of the sea, with the result that you need to say,
‘◄Who will need to cross the sea for us and bring them back to us, in order that we
can hear them and obey them?/Someone will need to cross the sea for us and bring
them back to us, in order that we can hear them and obey them.►’ [RHQ]
14 You do not need to do that because his commands are here with you. You know
them [MTY] and you have ◄memorized them/put them in your minds►. So you can
easily obey them.

16 I say again, if you obey the commands of Yahweh our God that I am giving to you
today, and if you love him and conduct your lives as he wants you to do, and if you
obey all his rules and regulations, you will prosper and become very numerous, and
Yahweh our God will bless you in the land that you are about to enter and possess.
17 But if you turn away from Yahweh and refuse to heed what he says, and if you
allow yourselves to be led away to worship other gods,
18 I am warning you today that you will soon die. You will not live for a long time
in the land that you are about to cross the Jordan River to enter and possess.
19 I am requesting that everyone in heaven and the earth testify to you, that today
I am allowing you to choose whether you want to live for a long time or to soon die,
whether you want Yahweh to bless you or to curse you. So choose to live.
20 Choose to love Yahweh our God, and to obey him [MTY], and to ◄be faithful to/
have a close relationship with► him. If you do that, you and your descendants will

Moses appointed Joshua to succeed him
1 When Moses/I finished saying all that to the Israeli people,
2 he/I said to them, “Now I am 120 years old. I am no longer able to go everywhere
that you go (OR, to be your leader). Furthermore, Yahweh has told me that I will not
cross the Jordan River.
3 But Yahweh our God will go ahead of you. He will enable you to destroy the nations
that are living there, in order that you can occupy their land. Joshua will be your
leader, which is what Yahweh already told me.
4 Yahweh will do to those nations what he did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the
Amor people-group when he destroyed their armies [MTY].
5 Yahweh will enable you to conquer those nations, but you must kill all of the
people of those nations, which is what I have commanded you to do.
6 Be brave and confident. Do not be afraid of those people. Do not forget that it
is Yahweh our God who will go with you. He will always help [LIT] you and never
abandon you.”
7 Then Moses/I summoned Joshua, and while all the Israeli people were listening,
he/I said to him, “Be brave and confident. You are the one who will lead these people
into the land that Yahweh promised to our ancestors that he would give to them, and
you will enable them to occupy it.
8 It is Yahweh who will go ahead of you. He will be with you. He will always help
[LIT] you. He will never abandon you. So do not be afraid or dismayed.”
The laws are to be read periodically
9 Moses/I wrote down all these laws on two scrolls and gave one scroll to the priests,
to the Israeli elders.
canceled, read this to the people during the Festival of Living in Temporary Shelters.
for them to worship him.
12 Gather together everyone—men, women, children, even the foreigners who are
living in your towns—in order that they may hear these laws and learn to revere
Yahweh our God, and to faithfully obey everything that is written in these laws.
13 If they do that, your descendants who have never known these laws will hear
them and will also learn to revere Yahweh our God, during all the years that they
live in the land that you are about to cross the Jordan River to occupy.”
Moses predicted their disobedience
14 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Listen carefully.
You will soon die. Summon
Joshua, and you go to the Sacred Tent with him, in order that I may appoint him to
be the new leader.” So Joshua and Moses/I went to the Sacred Tent.
15 There Yahweh appeared to them/us in a pillar of cloud, and that cloud was close
to the door of the tent.
16 Yahweh said to Moses/me, “You will soon die [EUP]. Then these people will
become unfaithful [MET] to me. They will abandon me and ◄break/stop obeying►
the agreement that I made with them. They will begin to worship the foreign/pagan
gods that are worshiped by the people of the land that they will enter.
DEUTERONOMY 31:17

DEUTERONOMY 32:2
17 When that happens, I will become very angry with them.
[DOU] and I will no longer help them [IDM], and I will destroy them {they will be
say, ‘We are certain that [RHQ] these things are happening to us because our God is
no longer with us.’
18 And because of all the evil things that they will have done, and especially because
they will have started to worship other gods, I will refuse to help [IDM] them.
19 “So, I am going to give you a song. Write it on a scroll and teach it to the Israeli
people and cause them to memorize it. It will be like a witness that accuses them.
20 I am about to take them into a very fertile [IDM] land, a land that I solemnly
promised their ancestors that I would give to them. There they will have plenty to
eat, with the result that their stomachs will always be full and they will become fat.
But then they will turn to other gods and start to worship them, and they will despise
me and ◄break/stop obeying► the agreement that I made with them.
21 And they will experience many terrible disasters. After that happens, their
descendants will never forget this song, and it will be like a witness that says, ‘Now
you know why Yahweh punished your ancestors.’ I will soon take them into the land
that I vowed that I would give to them; but now, before I do that, I know what they
are thinking that they will do when they are living there.”
22 So on the day that Yahweh gave Moses/me this song, he/I wrote it down, and he/I
taught it to the Israeli people.
23 Then Yahweh ◄appointed/set apart► Joshua and said to him, “Be brave and
confident, because you will lead the Israeli people into the land that I vowed that I
24 Then Moses/I finished writing on a scroll all the laws that Yahweh had told to
25 Then Moses/I told the descendants of Levi, who were carrying the Sacred Chest
that contained the Ten Commandments,
26 “Take this scroll on which these laws are written, and place it beside the Sacred
Chest that contains the agreement that Yahweh our God made with you, in order that
it may remain there to testify about what Yahweh will do to the people if they disobey
him.
27 I say this because I know that these people are very stubborn [DOU]. They have
rebelled against Yahweh all during the time that I have been with them, and they will
rebel much more after I die!
28 So gather all the elders of the tribes and your officials, in order that I can tell
them the words of this song, and request all those who are in heaven and on the earth
to be witnesses to testify against these people.
29 I say that because I know that after I die, the people will become very wicked.
They will turn away from doing everything that I have commanded them to do. And
in the future, because of all the evil things that they will do, they will cause Yahweh
to become angry with them. And he will cause them to experience disasters.”
The song that Moses sang to them
30 Then, while all the Israeli people listened, Moses/I sang/recited this entire song
to them:
32
1 “Listen to me, all you who are in the heavens,
and all you who are on the earth, listen to what I say [MTY].
2 I wish/desire that my teaching will fall on you like rain drops
DEUTERONOMY 32:3
303
DEUTERONOMY 32:14
or be like dew on the ground,
and be like a gentle rain on the young plants,
like showers on the grass.
3 I will praise Yahweh [MTY].
And all you people should tell others that our God is very great.
4 He is like a rock [MET] under which we are protected;
everything that he does is perfect and completely just/fair [DOU].
He always does what he says that he will do;
he never does anything that is wrong.
5 “But you Israeli people have been very unfaithful to him;
because of your sins, you no longer deserve to be his children.
You are extremely wicked and deceitful [DOU].
◄is this the way that you should repay Yahweh for all that he has done for you?/
done for you.► [RHQ]
he caused you to become a nation.
7 “Think about what happened long ago;
consider what happened to your ancestors.
Ask your parents, and they will inform you;
ask the older people, and they will tell you.
8 When God, who is greater than any other god, long ago divided the people into
groups,
he assigned to the nations their land.
He determined where each people-group should live
and ◄assigned to/chose for► each people-group a god/angel.
9 But Yahweh decided that we would be his people;
he chose us, the descendants of Jacob, to belong to him.
10 “He saw our ancestors when they were in a desert,
wandering in a land ◄that was desolate/where no people lived►.
He protected them and took care of them,
as every person takes good care of his own eyes. [SIM, IDM]
11 Yahweh protected his people just like an eagle encourages its babies to fly
and flutters over them [MET],
spreading its wings and catching them if they start to fall.
12 Yahweh was the only one who led them;
no other foreign god helped him.
13 “After they entered the land that Yahweh promised to give to them,
Yahweh enabled them to rule the hilly areas;
they ate the crops that grew in the fields.
They found honey in the rocks,
and their olive trees [MTY] grew even in stony ground.
14 The cows gave them plenty of curds/yogurt, the goats gave them plenty of milk,
they had well-fed sheep and cattle,
they had very good wheat,
DEUTERONOMY 32:15
304
DEUTERONOMY 32:28
and they made delicious wine from their grapes.
15 “The Israeli people became rich and prosperous,
but then they rebelled against God;
they abandoned him, the one who created them,
the one who powerfully saves them.
16 So he abandoned them because they started to worship other/strange gods.
Because of their worshiping disgusting idols,
he became angry.
gods that their ancestors had never known;
gods whom your ancestors had never revered.
18 They forgot the true God, the one who protects them [MET],
the one who created them and caused them to live.
19 “When Yahweh saw that they had abandoned him, he became angry,
so he rejected the Israeli people, who are like his sons and daughters.
20 He said, ‘They are very wicked/stubborn people,
very unfaithful;
so I will no longer help them,
and then I will watch and see what happens to them.
21 They *made me very angry because of their worshiping idols, which are not really
gods;
they have caused me to be jealous [MET] because I want them to worship only me.
So now, in order to cause them to become jealous,
I will send to attack them an army of a nation of worthless and foolish people.
22 I will be very angry, and I will destroy them
like a fire that will burn on the earth and all the way down to the place where
dead people are [MET];
that fire will destroy the earth and everything that grows on it,
and it will even burn what is down under the mountains.
23 I will cause them to experience many disasters;
they will feel as though [MET] I am shooting all my arrows at them.
24 They will die because of being hungry and because of having hot fevers
and because of terrible diseases;
I will send wild animals to attack [MTY] them,
and poisonous snakes to bite [MTY] them.
25 Outside their houses, their enemies will kill them [MTY] with swords,
and in their homes, their enemies will cause them to be terrified.
Their enemies will kill young men and young women,
and they will kill infants and old people with gray hair.
26 I wanted to scatter the Israeli people to distant countries
in order that no one would ever remember them.
27 But if I did that, their enemies would wrongly boast
that they were the ones who had gotten rid of my people;
they would say, “We [SYN] are the ones who defeated them;
it was not Yahweh who has done all these things.” ’
28 You Israelis are a nation of people who do not have any sense.
* 32:21 Because they hey
DEUTERONOMY 32:29
305
DEUTERONOMY 32:42
you would have realized what was going to happen to you.
30 You would have realized why 1,000 of your soldiers would be defeated by only one
of the enemy soldiers,
and why two of your enemies would chase away 10,000 Israeli soldiers.
You would realize that this would happen only if God, the one who always defended
you [MET], had allowed your enemies to defeat you,
because he had abandoned you.
31 Your enemies know that their gods are not powerful like Yahweh, our God,
so their gods could not have defeated us Israelis.
32 Your enemies are like [MET] grapevines planted near the ruins of Sodom and
Gomorrah cities;
the grapes from those vines are bitter and poisonous;
33 the wine from those grapes is like the poison of snakes [DOU].
34 “Yahweh says, ‘I know [RHQ] what I have planned to do to the Israeli people and to
their enemies,
35 I am the one who will get revenge and pay those enemies back for what they have
at the right time for them to be punished [IDM];
and I will punish/destroy them quickly.’
36 “But Yahweh will see that you who are truly his people, who ◄are innocent/have
not done things that are wrong►,
and he will be merciful to you.
And he will see that you are helpless,
and that there are very few of you, slaves or free people, who are still alive.
37 Then Yahweh will ask his people, ‘Where are the gods
that you thought would protect you [MET]?
38 You gave to those gods the best parts of the animals that you sacrificed,
and you poured out wine for them to drink.
So, they should begin to help you;
they should be the ones who will protect you!
39 “But now you will realize that I, only I, am God;
there is no other god who is a real god.
I am the one who can kill people and who can cause people to live;
I can wound people, and I can heal people,
and there is no one who can prevent me from doing those things.
40 I raise my hand toward heaven and solemnly declare
that just as sure as I live forever,
41 that when I sharpen my sword,
as I [SYN] prepare to punish people,
I will get revenge on my enemies;
I will pay back those who hate me.
42 I will kill all of my enemies with a sword;
it will be as though I had arrows that will be covered with their blood.
DEUTERONOMY 32:43
306
DEUTERONOMY 33:6
I will kill [MTY] all those whom I capture
and cut off their leaders’ heads.’
43 “You people of all nations, you as well as his people should praise Yahweh,
because Yahweh gets revenge on those who kill the people who serve him;
and he cleanses his people’s land
which has become defiled because of their sins.”
44 Joshua and Moses/I recited the words of that song while the Israeli people were
listening.
45 When they/we finished reciting to the Israeli people the words of this song,
46 Moses/I said, “Never forget all these commands that I have been giving you today.
Teach these laws to your children, in order that they will faithfully obey all of them.
47 These instructions are very important [LIT]. If you obey them, you will live a long
time in the land that you are about to cross the Jordan River to occupy.”
God told Moses that he would see the land from far away
48 On that same day, Yahweh said to Moses/me,
49 “Go to the Abarim Mountain range here in the Moab region, across from Jericho.
Climb Nebo Mountain, and look toward the west to see Canaan land, the land that I
am about to give to the Israeli people.
50 You will die on that mountain [EUP, DOU], like your older brother Aaron died on
Hor Mountain.
51 You will die because both of you disobeyed me in the presence of the Israeli
people, when you all were at Meribah Springs near Kadesh town in the Zin Desert.
You did not honor and respect me in the presence of the Israeli people in the way
that I deserve because I am God.
52 When you are on that mountain where I told you to go, you will see in the distance
in front of you the land that I am about to give to the Israeli people, but you will not
enter it.”
Moses blessed the Israeli tribes
33
1 Before God’s prophet Moses died, he asked God to bless the Israeli people.
2 This is what he said:
“Yahweh came and spoke to us at Sinai Mountain;
and like his light shone on us when we were in the desert near Paran Mountain
He came with 10,000 angels,
3 Yahweh truly loves his people,
So they prostrate themselves in front of him,
and they listen to his instructions.
4 I gave them laws to obey,
laws that would be the most precious thing that the descendants of Jacob owned.
5 So Yahweh became the king of his Israeli people
when all the tribes and their leaders were gathered together.
6 I say this about the tribe of Reuben:
DEUTERONOMY 33:7
307
DEUTERONOMY 33:17
I desire/hope that their tribe will never disappear,
but they will never become numerous.
7 “ say this about the tribe of Judah:
Yahweh, listen to them when they call out for help;
and unite them with the other tribes again.
Fight for them,
and help them to fight against their enemies.
8 I say this about the tribe of Levi:
Yahweh, give to those who are dedicated to you the sacred stones that they will use
to find out what you want to be done;
You tested them at a spring in the desert, a spring that they named Massah and also
named Meribah
to find out if they would ◄remain loyal to/continue to obey► you.
9 The tribe of Levi did what you told them to do
and obeyed the agreement that you made with the Israeli people;
those laws were more important to them [HYP]
than their siblings and parents and children.
10 The tribe of Levi will teach the Israeli people [DOU] your rules and regulations,
and they are the ones who will burn incense and who will completely burn on
the altar the offerings that the people bring.
11 Yahweh, bless their work
and ◄accept/be pleased with► all that they do.
Crush/Destroy all their enemies;
do not enable their enemies to be able to fight against them again.
12 I say this about the tribe of Benjamin:
They are the tribe that Yahweh loves;
he keeps them safe.
He protects them continually,
and he lives among their hills [MET].
13 “ say this about the tribes of Joseph:
I desire/hope that Yahweh will bless their land
by giving them rain/dew from the sky
and water from deep in the ground,
and good crops at harvest time.
15 I desire/hope that very nice fruit will grow on trees in their ancient mountains/hills
[DOU],
16 and that their land will be have many good crops,
blessed by Yahweh, the one who appeared to me in a burning bush.
I desire/hope that Yahweh will bless the tribes of Joseph in all those ways,
because he was the leaders of his older brothers when they were in Egypt.
17 The descendants of Joseph will be as strong as [SIM] a bull;
with their weapons they will wound their enemies, like [MET] a wild ox gores other
animals with its horns.
They will force other people-groups,
all of them, to be exiled to the most distant places on the earth.
That is what the descendants of the two sons of Joseph will do,
DEUTERONOMY 33:18
308
DEUTERONOMY 33:27
the ten thousands of the tribe of Ephraim and the thousands of the tribe of
Manasseh.
18 “ say this about the tribes of Zebulun and Issachar:
I desire/hope that the people of Zebulun will prosper in their travels across the seas,
and that the people of Issachar will prosper while they stay at home and take
care of their cattle and crops.
19 They will invite people from the other Israeli tribes to the mountain where they
worship Yahweh,
and they will offer the correct/proper sacrifices to him.
They will become rich from the work that they do on the seas
and from the things that they make from (OR, find in) the sand on the beaches.
20 “ say this about the tribe of Gad:
Praise Yahweh, the one who made their territory large.
The people of their tribe will attack their enemies fiercely [SIM] like a lion that
crouches,
waiting to tear off the arm or the scalp of some animal.
21 They chose the best part of the land for themselves;
a large share of the land, a share that should be given to a leader was allotted to
them.
When the leaders of the tribes of Israel gathered together,
they decided that the tribe of Gad should have a large share of the land.
The tribe of Gad obeyed the commands of Yahweh and the things that he decided
that they should do.
22 “ say this about the tribe of Dan:
The people of the tribe of Dan are like [SIM] a young lion;
23 “ say this about the tribe of Naphtali:
The people of the tribe of Naphtali have been blessed by Yahweh, who has been very
their land extends far south from Lake Galilee.
24 “ say this about the tribe of Asher:
May Yahweh bless the descendants of Asher more than he will bless the other tribes.
May he favor Asher’s descendants most of all.
I desire/hope that their land will be filled with olive trees that will produce a lot
of [IDM] olives to make olive oil.
25 Their towns will be protected by high walls with gates that have bronze and iron
bars;
I desire/hope that they will be strong and secure/protected all the time that they
are alive.
26 “You people of Israel, there is no god like your God,
who rides majestically across the sky to help you.
27 God, who lives forever, is the one who ◄gives you refuge/protects you►;
it is as though he puts his everlasting arms under you to support you.
He will expel your enemies while you advance;
he has told you to destroy all of them.
DEUTERONOMY 33:28
309
DEUTERONOMY 34:12
28 So, you Israeli people will live safely;
you descendants of Jacob will not be disturbed by others;
in the land where you will live, there will be plenty of grain and wine,
and there will be plenty of rain.
29 You people of Israel, Yahweh ◄has blessed/is pleased with► you.
There is certainly [RHQ] no nation like your nation,
whom Yahweh has rescued from being slaves in Egypt.
He will be like [MET] a shield to protect you
and like [MET] a sword to enable you to defeat your enemies.
Your enemies will come to you begging for you to act mercifully toward them,
but you will trample on their backs/necks.”
How Moses died
34
1 Then Moses climbed up from the plains in the Moab region to the top of Pisgah
Peak on Nebo Mountain, across the Jordan River from Jericho. There Yahweh showed
him all the land that the Israelis would occupy. He showed him the Gilead region as
far north as Dan city;
2 all the land that the tribe of Naphtali would occupy; all the land that the tribes
of Ephraim and Manasseh had occupied; all the land that the tribe of Judah would
occupy as far west as the Mediterranean sea;
Jericho in the north to Zoar city in the south.
to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have
allowed you to see it from a distance, but you will not go there.”
5 So Moses, who always served Yahweh faithfully, died there on that mountain in
the Moab region, which is what Yahweh said would happen.
6 Yahweh buried Moses’ body in a valley in the Moab region, opposite/near BethPeor town, but no one to this day knows where Yahweh buried him.
7 Moses was 120 years old when he died, but he was still very strong, and he could
still see [MTY] very well.
8 The Israeli people mourned for him in the plains of the Moab region for 30 days.
9 God caused Joshua to be very wise, because Moses had put his hands on Joshua to
appoint him to be their new leader. The Israeli people obeyed Joshua, and they obeyed
all the commands that Yahweh had given to Moses to tell to the Israeli people.
10 Since the time that Moses lived, there has never been a prophet in Israel like him.
Yahweh spoke to him face-to-face/directly.
11 No other prophet has performed all the kinds of [DOU] miracles that Yahweh sent
Moses to perform in front of the king of Egypt, his officials, and all [HYP] the people
of Egypt.
12 No other prophet has been able to do all the great and terrifying things that
Moses did while all the Israelis watched.
JOSHUA 1:1
310
JOSHUA 1:16
This book contains the account of the Israeli people
possessing the land that God had promised to give them.
We call this book
Joshua
What Yahweh commanded Joshua
1 After Moses, who served Yahweh well, died, Yahweh said to Nun’s son Joshua,
who had been Moses’ assistant,
2 “You know that my servant Moses is now dead. So now get ready to lead all these
Israeli people across the Jordan River. Enter the land that I will soon give to you.
3 I will give to you all the land that you walk on, as I promised Moses.
4 That land will extend from the desert in the south, to the Lebanon Mountains in the
northwest, and to the big Euphrates River in the northeast, and to the Mediterranean
Sea on the west. It will include all the land where the descendants of Heth live.
5 No group will be able to oppose and defeat you during your life. I will help you
as I helped Moses. I will always be with [LIT] you; I will never forsake you.
6 “Be strong and courageous, because you are the one who will lead these Israeli
people and enable them to possess the land that I solemnly promised to their ancestors
that I would give them.
7 Just be strong and very courageous. Be sure to obey all the laws that my servant
Moses gave to you. In order that you may be successful wherever you go, do not stop
obeying any of them [IDM].
8 Make sure to habitually read to the people some of the laws that God gave Moses.
If you do that, you will be successful in everything that you do [DOU].
not be afraid, and do not be discouraged, because I, Yahweh, your God, will ◄be with/
10 Then Joshua commanded the leaders of the people of Israel,
11 “Go throughout the camp and tell the people this: ‘Prepare all the food that you
will take with you, because the day after tomorrow you will cross this Jordan River,
in order to possess the land that Yahweh, our God, is about to give you.’ ”
What Joshua commanded the eastern tribes
12 But to the clans that were descendants of Reuben and Gad, and to the half clan
that were descendants of Manasseh, Joshua said,
13 “Do not forget what Moses, the servant of Yahweh, commanded you: ‘Yahweh,
your God, has given you this land in order that you can live here safely/peacefully.’
14 Your wives and your children and your livestock may stay here in this land on
the east side of the Jordan River, but all your soldiers must cross the river, ahead of
the people of the other tribes. They must take all their weapons with them. You must
continue to help your fellow Israelis
15 until they are able to live there safely/peacefully, as Yahweh has enabled you to
do. You must help them until after they have conquered all the people in the land
that Yahweh, your God, is giving them. After that, your soldiers may return to live in
this land that Moses gave to you here on the east side of the Jordan River.”
16 The people answered Joshua, “We will do everything that you have commanded
us to do, and we will go wherever you tell us to go.
JOSHUA 1:17
311
JOSHUA 2:14
17 As we obeyed all that Moses told us to do, we will obey all that you tell us to do.
We pray that Yahweh will ◄be with/help► you as he ◄was with/helped► Moses.
18 Anyone who ◄rejects what you say/opposes you► and does not obey what you
command [DOU], we will execute. But we want you to be strong and courageous!”
2
1 Then Joshua chose two men from their camp at Acacia. He told them, “Go across
the Jordan River and secretly find out all that you can about the land on that side of
the river, especially about Jericho city.” So the two men crossed the river and entered
Jericho. They entered the house of a prostitute, whose name was Rahab. They stayed
in her house that night.
2 But someone saw them and told the king of Jericho, “Some Israeli men have come
here tonight to spy out the land!”
3 So the king sent some messengers to tell Rahab, “Bring out the men who came
and entered your house, so that we can kill them, because they have come here to
◄spy out/find out all they can about► this land!”
4 She told them that the two men had gone to her house. But she had hidden the
two men there. So when the messengers came to her house, she told them, “Two men
came here, but I did not know where they had come from.
5 At dusk, just before ◄guards closed the city gate/the city gates were closed►, the
two men left. I do not know where they went. So, go quickly and search for them!
6 But she was lying, she had taken the two men up to the flat roof of her house and
7 The messengers went out of the city to search for the two men. Immediately, the
guards shut the city gate. The messengers went along the road that leads down to
the place where people can walk across the Jordan River, but they did not find the two
men.
8 Before the two men lay down to sleep that night, Rahab went up to the roof
9 and said to them, “We know that Yahweh is about to give this land to you Israelis,
and as a result all the people living in this land are terrified because of you.
10 We have heard about how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea for you to
cross it when you left Egypt. And we have heard how you killed Sihon and Og, the
two kings of the tribe of Amor who lived east of the Jordan River. You Israelis totally
destroyed everyone and everything in their kingdom.
11 When we heard about those things, we were very dismayed. We no longer have
enough courage to fight against you, because we know that Yahweh, the God whom
you worship, is helping you. And we know that he rules everything in heaven and
here on earth.
12 So now I want you to solemnly promise me, and ask Yahweh to punish you if you
do not do what you promise. Solemnly promise me that you will act kindly to me
and my family, because I have acted kindly to you.
13 Do something to prove that you will ◄spare the lives of/not kill► my father and
my mother, my brothers and sisters, and all of their families. Promise me that you
Israelis will not kill us when you destroy this city.”
14 The two men replied, “We desire that God will cause us to die if we do not do
as we say! If you do not tell others what we are planning to do, we will act kindly
toward you all when Yahweh enables us to possess the land.”
JOSHUA 2:15
312
JOSHUA 3:6
15 One of the outside walls of the house where Rahab lived was part of the wall that
was around the city. So she fastened a rope outside the window that was in that wall,
by which the men could climb down the wall.
16 Then she said to them, “When you leave the city, go up into the hills so that the
men who are searching for you will not find you. Hide in caves in the hills for three
days, until the men who are searching for you return to the city. Then you can return
safely to your camp.”
17 The two men gave her a red cord, and said to her, “This is what you must do; if
you do not do this, we will not be required to do what we have vowed to do.
18 You must tie this red cord in the window that has the rope by which we will
climb down. You must let the cord hang there. And you must bring your father and
your mother and your brothers and all the others in your family inside the house.
Then, when our army enters your land, we will see the cord, and we will not kill the
people in your house.
19 If anyone in your family goes outside this house into the street, our soldiers will
kill them, and we will not be guilty [MTY] for doing that. But if anyone who is in this
house with you is injured, we will be guilty for causing that.
20 But if you tell anyone what we are planning to do, we are not required to do what
we have vowed to do.”
21 Rahab said, “I agree to do what you say.” So they climbed down the rope and
22 When the two men left the city, they went up into the hills. They stayed there
them. They searched all along the road, but they did not find the two men. So they
23 Then the two men started back toward their camp. They went down from the
hills, went down to the river, crossed it at the place where people can walk across it,
and returned to their camp. They told Joshua everything that had happened to them.
24 They said to Joshua, “We are sure that Yahweh is going to enable us to possess
everything that is in that land. The people there are terrified [IDM] because of us.”

The Israelis crossed the Jordan River
1 Joshua and all the other Israelis got up early the next morning. They left their camp
at Acacia and went down to the Jordan River. They camped there for two nights.
2 Then the leaders went throughout the camp,
3 telling the people, “You will see some of the priests, who are descendants of Levi,
carrying the chest that contains the Ten Commandments that Yahweh our God gave
us. When you see them, leave the places where you are camped and follow them.
4 You have not been ◄here/along this road► before, so you must follow the priests.
But do not walk close to the chest. Stay ◄1,000 yards/900 meters► from the chest.
The chest is sacred, so ◄God will punish you/you will be punished► if you come close
to it.”
5 Then Joshua told the people, “Perform the ceremonies needed to make yourselves
acceptable to Yahweh, because tomorrow he is going to do things for you that will
amaze you!”
6 Then Joshua said to the priests, “Carry the chest and go in front of the rest of the
people.” So they lifted up the chest and went ahead.
JOSHUA 3:7
313
JOSHUA 4:7
7 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “This is the day that I will begin to show all the
Israeli people that you are a great leader. Then they will honor you, and know that I
am with/helping you as I ◄was with/helped► Moses.
8 Tell the priests who are carrying the chest that contains the Ten Commandments,
‘When you come to the edge of the Jordan River, stand in the water.’ ”
9 Then Joshua said to the Israeli people, “Come close to me in order that you can
listen to what Yahweh, your God, is saying.”
10 When they came near, he said to them, “This is how you will know that God,
who is all-powerful, is among you, and that he will expel for you the descendants of
Canaan, Heth, Hiv, Periz, Girgash, Amor, and Jebus who are now living in that land.
11 Keep in mind that Yahweh is the one who rules over all the earth. The chest
belongs to him, and it will be carried into the Jordan River ahead of you.
12 So choose twelve men, one from each of the tribes of Israel, and I will tell you
later what I want them to do.
13 As for the priests who are carrying the chest, as soon as they put their feet into
the Jordan River, the water will stop flowing. It will pile up because I will cause it to
be blocked upstream.”
priests who were carrying the chest containing the Ten Commandments went in front
15 It was springtime, when people harvest their crops, and at that time the river
floods over its banks. But as soon as the priests reached the edge of the river and
stepped into the water,
16 the water stopped flowing. The water piled up far upstream, at a town named
Adam, near Zarethan. The water stopped flowing down to the Dead Sea. So the people
were able to cross the river near Jericho.
17 The priests who were carrying the chest containing the Ten Commandments that
Yahweh had given them stood on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan riverbed,
while the rest of the Israeli people crossed the river as though they were crossing dry
ground.

The Israeli people and Joshua set up memorials
1 After all the people of the Israeli nation had finished crossing the Jordan River,
Yahweh said to Joshua,
2 “When you choose the twelve men, one from each tribe, whom I mentioned
previously, tell them to pick up large stones from the middle of the Jordan riverbed,
where the priests are still standing.
3 Tell them to carry the stones with you and put them down at the place where you
will stay tonight.”
4 So Joshua chose twelve men, one from each tribe. He called them together, and
said to them,
5 “Go into the middle of the Jordan riverbed, to where the priests are standing,
holding the chest that Yahweh, your God, gave you. Each of you must pick up a large
stone, one for each tribe, and carry it on your shoulder to our camp.
6 Then pile them up to be a memorial for you. In the future, when your children
ask, ‘What do these stones mean?’,
7 tell them that the water in the Jordan River was blocked off when the priests
were carrying the chest that contained the Ten Commandments that Yahweh gave us.
When the chest was carried into the Jordan River, the water was blocked off so that
JOSHUA 4:8
314
JOSHUA 4:24
we could cross the riverbed. These stones will be a memorial for the descendants of
us Israeli people forever.”
8 So those Israeli men did what Joshua told them to do. They went and picked up
twelve large stones from the middle of the Jordan riverbed, one stone for each of the
tribes, just as Yahweh had told Joshua. They carried the stones to their camp and put
them down.
9 Then Joshua set up twelve other large stones in a pile, in the middle of the Jordan
riverbed, where the priests who carried the chest containing the Ten Commandments
were standing. And those stones are still there.
10 The priests who carried the chest remained standing in the middle of the Jordan
riverbed until the people had finished doing everything that Yahweh had commanded
Joshua. The Israeli people crossed the riverbed quickly.
chest the rest of the way across the river.
12 The soldiers of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and of half of the soldiers of the tribe of
Manasseh, crossed over ahead of the rest of the Israeli people, carrying their weapons,
as Moses had commanded.
13 As Yahweh was watching, there were about 40,000 of those soldiers, carrying
weapons ready for battle, who crossed the riverbed to the plains near Jericho, ready
to fight.
14 On that day, all the people of Israel saw that Yahweh had caused Joshua to be a
great leader. And they honored Joshua for the rest of his life, just as they had honored
Moses.
15 Yahweh said to Joshua,
16 “Now tell the priests who are carrying the chest containing the Ten Commandments to come up from the Jordan riverbed.”
17 So Joshua commanded the priests to do that.
18 Then the priests, carrying the chest containing the Ten Commandments that
Yahweh had given to Moses, came up out of the riverbed. And as soon as they walked
up out of the riverbed onto the riverbank, the water of the Jordan River flowed again,
and flooded over the river banks as it had done before.
19 It was on the tenth day of the first month of that year that the people crossed
over the Jordan River and camped at a place called Gilgal, on the east side of the land
near Jericho city.
20 The men who were carrying the twelve large stones from the Jordan riverbed
brought them to Joshua, and he set them up at Gilgal
21 Joshua said to the Israeli people, “In the future, when your children and
grandchildren ask, ‘◄What do these stones mean/Why are these stones here►?’,
22 tell them, ‘We Israeli people crossed the Jordan River as though we were crossing
on dry ground.
23 As we were watching, Yahweh, your God, dried up the river until we had all
crossed over. Yahweh, the God whom we worship, did to the Jordan River just like he
did to the Red Sea, when he caused it to become dry as our parents were watching,
until they all crossed over it.
24 Yahweh did that in order that all the people-groups of the earth may know that
he [MTY] is very powerful, and in order that you may always ◄be in awe of/revere►
Yahweh, your God.’ ”
JOSHUA 5:1
315
JOSHUA 5:15

1 All the kings of the people-groups to the west of the Jordan River and all the
kings of the groups who were descendants of Canaan and who lived close to the
Mediterranean Sea heard about how Yahweh had dried up the water of the Jordan
River until all we Israeli people had crossed over. So they became very dismayed.
The Israeli males were circumcised at Gilgal
2 While they were camped at Gilgal, Yahweh said to Joshua, “The Israeli males who
lived in Egypt were circumcised before they left there. Now make knives from flint
stones and circumcise all the Israeli males who have been born since then.”
3 So Joshua made knives and circumcised the Israeli males at a place that is now
called ‘Circumcision Hill’.
4 The reason they did that is that all the men who left Egypt, those who were old
enough to be soldiers, died in the desert after they left Egypt.
5 They had been circumcised in Egypt, but the baby boys who had been born
while their parents were camping in the desert after they left Egypt had not been
circumcised.
6 Our Israeli ancestors traveled around in the desert for 40 years, and all the men
who were old enough to be soldiers had died. The women had also died. They had
not obeyed Yahweh, so Yahweh said that they would not arrive at the land that he
had promised to our ancestors that he would give to us, a land that was very fertile
[MTY].
7 The sons of those who had disobeyed Yahweh were the ones whom Joshua
circumcised at Gilgal. They were circumcised because they had not been circumcised
while they were traveling in the desert.
8 After all the Israeli males had been circumcised, they remained in the camp and
rested until their wounds were healed.
9 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “Because your forefathers were slaves in Egypt, the
Egyptians felt a revulsion toward you. But today I have removed the revulsion the
Egyptians have had toward you.” Because of that, the people called the place ‘Gilgal’,
which sounds like the Hebrew word ‘removed’, and it still has that name.
10 In the evening of the fourteenth day of that month, while the Israeli people were
camped at Gilgal, on the plain near Jericho city, they celebrated the Passover Festival.
11 The next day, they found some barley grain in the fields in that area. So they
took that and roasted it and ate it with bread that was made without yeast.
12 The next day, God stopped sending manna for the Israeli people to eat. After
that, they ate food that was grown in Canaan.
The commander of Yahweh’s army appeared to Joshua.
13 One day when Joshua came near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing
in front of him. The man was holding a sword in his hand. Joshua approached him
and asked him, “Are you going to fight for us or against us?”
14 The man replied, “I am not planning to fight with you or against you. Instead, I
am the commander of Yahweh’s army in heaven, and I have come down from there
to assure you that Yahweh will help you.” Then Joshua bowed down with his face on
the ground ◄to show his respect for/to worship► the man, and said to him, “Tell me
what you want me to do.”
15 The commander of Yahweh’s army replied, “Take off your sandals! I am Yahweh,
and the ground on which you are standing is holy because I am here.” So Joshua took
off his sandals.
JOSHUA 6:1
316
JOSHUA 6:16
The walls of Jericho collapsed and the Israelis captured the city.
were afraid of the Israeli army. No one was allowed to go into the city or go out of it.
2 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “Listen to what I say! I am going to enable your
army [SYN] to capture/conquer [MTY] Jericho and its king and its soldiers.
3 So your army must march around the city for six days, once each day.
4 Tell seven priests to march around with them. Each priest must carry a trumpet.
Four other priests must carry the sacred chest, and they must walk behind the priests
who are carrying the trumpets. On the seventh day, the army must march around
the city seven times, and the priests must be blowing the trumpets while they march.
5 After they have all marched around the city seven times, the priests must blow
their trumpets once, very loudly. When the Israeli people/soldiers hear that, they
must shout loudly. Then the wall of the city will collapse, and all the Israeli people/
soldiers will go straight into the city.”
6 So Joshua summoned the priests and said to them, “Tell four priests to carry the
chest that contains the Ten Commandments that Yahweh gave to us. Tell seven other
priests to carry trumpets and walk in front of them.”
7 And Joshua told the soldiers, “Start marching! March around the city, with several
soldiers with weapons marching in front. Behind them will march the seven priests
with trumpets, and behind them will march the four priests carrying Yahweh’s sacred
chest.”
8 After Joshua told that to the army, the seven priests, each carrying a sacred
trumpet, started marching, blowing their trumpets. The four priests who were
carrying Yahweh’s sacred chest followed them.
9 The group of soldiers carrying weapons marched in front of the priests who were
blowing their trumpets, and the rest of the soldiers followed the four men carrying the
chest. While they were all marching, the seven priests were blowing their trumpets.
10 But the rest of the people were silent, because Joshua had commanded them, “Do
not make a war cry. Do not yell or say anything until the day when I tell you to shout.
On that day, you must shout loudly!”
11 So the men carrying Yahweh’s sacred chest and all the others did what Joshua
told them to do. They marched around the city once. Then they all returned to their
camp and stayed there that night.
12 The next morning, Joshua and the priests got up early, and the four priests carried
Yahweh’s sacred chest again.
13 The seven priests who were carrying trumpets went in front of the men carrying
the chest. The seven priests were blowing their trumpets as they marched. The group
of soldiers carrying weapons went in front of all the others, and the rest of the army
followed all the others. All the time, the seven priests were blowing their trumpets.
14 So on that second day they again marched around the city once and then returned
to their camp. They did the same thing for six days.
15 On the seventh day, they got up at dawn, and they all marched around the city
the same way that they had done before, but this time they marched around the city
seven times.
16 As they were marching around the seventh time, when the priests were about to
blow the long/loud blast on their trumpets, Joshua commanded the people, “Shout,
because Yahweh will enable you to capture the city!
JOSHUA 6:17
317
JOSHUA 7:5
17 Yahweh has declared that you must destroy [IDM] the city and everything in it to
show that it belongs to him. You must spare only Rahab the prostitute and the others
18 And because Yahweh has declared that everything must be destroyed [IDM], you
must not take [EUP] any of the things in the city. If you take anything, you will cause
Yahweh to destroy our own camp and cause terrible things to happen to us.
19 But all the silver and gold and articles made from iron and bronze that you find,
you must set apart for Yahweh. You must put those things in his treasury.”
20 So they did what Joshua told them to do. When the priests blew a long blast on
their trumpets, the people/army shouted loudly, and the wall of the city collapsed!
Then the Israeli soldiers rushed in and captured the city.
21 They killed [IDM] every living thing in the city—men and women, young people
and old people, even cattle and sheep and donkeys.
all they could about► the land, “Go to the prostitute’s house. Bring her out, along
23-25 So those two spies/men went into Rahab’s house and brought her out. They
also brought out her father and mother and her brothers, and all the rest of her
family. Joshua’s men spared Rahab the prostitute. They also did not kill all her
relatives, because she had hidden and protected the spies/men whom Joshua had
sent to Jericho. The two men brought them all out and put them in a place outside
the camp of the Israelis. Rahab still lives among us Israeli people. Then the soldiers
gathered the articles made from silver, gold, bronze, and iron that they found and
they put them all into Yahweh’s treasury. But they burned everything else that was
in the city.
26 At that time, Joshua warned the people, “Yahweh will curse/punish anyone who
tries to rebuild this city, Jericho. When that person lays/builds its foundation, his
oldest son will die. And when he finishes building the city wall and sets up its gates,
his youngest son will die.”
27 Because of what happened that day, it was clear that Yahweh was with/helped
Joshua, and Joshua became famous throughout the land.
7
The men of Ai defeated the Israelis
1 Yahweh had commanded that all the things that they had captured in Jericho should
be destroyed to show that they belong to him. But there was a man from the tribe
of Judah named Achan. He was the son of Carmi and grandson of Zabdi and greatgrandson of Zerah. He disobeyed what Yahweh had commanded and took for himself
some of those things. So Yahweh was very angry with the Israelis.
2 Joshua told some of his men to go from Jericho to Ai town, which was east of
Bethel city and near Beth-Aven town. He said to them, “Go to Ai and ◄spy out the
area/see what the area is like►.” So the men went.
3 When they returned to Joshua they said, “There are only a few people in Ai. So
we do not need to send all of our soldiers to defeat them. Send 2.000 or 3,000 men to
attack them. That will be enough.”
4 So about 3,000 Israeli men went to attack Ai. But the men of Ai defeated them
badly.
5 They killed about 36 Israelis and chased the rest of Israeli men from the city gate
to the bottom of the hill. When the other Israelis saw that this had happened, they
became very discouraged.
JOSHUA 7:6
318
JOSHUA 7:20
6 Joshua and the other Israeli leaders tore their clothes because they were very sad
about being defeated. They prostrated themselves on the ground in front of the Sacred
Tent in which was the sacred chest. They stayed there until that evening. They also
threw dirt on their heads to show that they were very sad about what had happened.
7 Then Joshua prayed and said, “Lord God, you brought us Israelis safely across
the Jordan River. So why are you now allowing the Amor people-group to defeat us
[RHQ]? This would not have happened if we had stayed on the other side of the Jordan
River!
8 Lord, we Israelis have been defeated by our enemies, so I do not know what to
say now [RHQ].
9 The Canaan people-group and all the other people who are living in this land will
hear about this. Then they will surround us and kill all of us! Then what will you do
◄to defend your reputation [MTY]/to show that you are a powerful God►?”
10 But Yahweh said to Joshua, “Stand up! Stop lying there with your face on the
ground [RHQ]!
11 You Israelis have sinned! You have disobeyed the commands that I told you to
obey. One of your men has taken some of the things that I told you to destroy. He has
stolen them and taken them for himself and lied about it.
12 That is why you Israelis have been unable to be strong when you went to attack
your enemies. That is why you have run away from them. And now you yourselves
may be destroyed. If you do not do as I commanded you and destroy everything that
you captured in Jericho I will not help you any more!”
Achan was punished for his sin
13 “Now go and tell this to the people: ‘Tomorrow you must perform the rituals that
will cause yourselves to become acceptable to Yahweh again. Yahweh, the God whom
we Israelis worship, says that one of you has kept things that he told you to destroy.
You will never defeat your enemies until you get rid of those things.
14 ‘Tomorrow morning you must present yourselves before Yahweh, tribe by tribe.
Then Yahweh will indicate to which tribe the man who took those things belongs.
Then Yahweh will indicate to which clan from that tribe the guilty man belongs. Then
Yahweh will indicate to which family he belongs. And then he will indicate which
person in that family took those things.
15 Then the one who has taken some of the things that should have been destroyed
will be destroyed in a fire. And everything he owns will be destroyed with him,
because he has disobeyed the command that Yahweh gave us and has done something
that is disgraceful to us Israeli people.’ ”
16 Early the next morning, Joshua told all the Israeli people to stand before the
Sacred Tent, tribe by tribe. When they did that, Yahweh indicated that a man from
the tribe of Judah was the one who had taken the things.
17 Then the clans of Judah presented themselves, and Yahweh indicated that
someone from the clan of Zerah was the guilty one. Then the families of Zerah’s
clan presented themselves, and Yahweh indicated that someone from the family of
Zabdi was the guilty one.
18 Then Joshua told the men from that family to present themselves. And Yahweh
indicated that Achan was guilty.
19 Then Joshua said to Achan, “Son, tell the truth [IDM]. Confess to Yahweh, the God
whom we Israelis worship, what you have done. And tell me what you did, and do
not try to ◄conceal anything/prevent me from knowing what you did►.”
20 Achan replied, “It is true. I have sinned against Yahweh, the God whom we
Israelis worship.
JOSHUA 7:21
319
JOSHUA 8:11
21 Among the things in Jericho that I saw was a beautiful coat from Babylonia. I also
saw 200 pieces of silver and some gold that weighed as much as 50 pieces of silver.
I wanted those things very much for myself, so I took them. I buried them all in the
ground under my tent. You will find them there. The silver is buried under the other
things.”
22 So Joshua sent some men to find those things. They ran to Achan’s tent and found
all the things hidden there.
23 The men brought them all out of the tent and took them to Joshua and the rest
of the Israeli people. Then they spread/laid them out on the ground, where Yahweh
could see them.
24 Then Joshua and the rest of the people led Achan down to the valley. They also
took down there the silver, the coat, the gold, Achan’s wife and sons and daughters,
and his cattle and donkeys and sheep, and his tent, and everything else that he owned.
25 Joshua said, “◄I do not know why you caused so much trouble for us/You have
caused a lot of trouble for us► [RHQ], but now Yahweh will cause trouble for you.”
Then all the people threw stones at Achan and his family until they all died. Then
the people burned their corpses.
26 They piled rocks over the ashes of their corpses, and those rocks are still there.
That is why that valley is called Trouble Valley. After that, Yahweh was no longer
angry with the Israeli people.
8
The town of Ai is destroyed
1 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid or discouraged because of what
happened at Ai. Lead all of your soldiers and go there again. I will help you to defeat
the king of Ai, his people, and his city, and enable you to take his land.
2 Your army will do to the people of Ai and their king like what you did to the people
of Jericho and their king. But this time I will permit you to take all their possessions
and keep them for yourselves. But first, tell some of your soldiers to hide behind the
city and prepare to suddenly attack it.”
3 So Joshua led all his army toward Ai. He chose 30,000 of his best fighters/warriors
and prepared to send them out during the night.
4 He said to them, “Listen carefully. Some of you must hide on the other side of the
city. Do not go far from the city. Just be ready to attack.
5 I and the men who are with me will march toward the city in the morning. The
men in the city will come out to fight us, like they did before. Then we will turn
around and start to run away from them.
6 They will think that we are running away from them like we did before. So they
will chase us away from the city. While we are running away,
7 those of you who are hiding come out and rush into the city and capture it. Yahweh
your God will enable you to conquer it.
8 After you capture the city, burn it. Do what Yahweh has commanded us to do.
Those are the orders I am giving to you.”
9 Then Joshua prepared to send some of them to hide and wait between Ai and
10 Early the next morning, Joshua gathered his soldiers together. Then he and the
11 They all set up their tents close to Ai, just to the north of the city, where all the
320
JOSHUA 8:31
12 Then Joshua chose about 5,000 men and told them to go and hide just west of the
city, between Ai and Bethel.
13 So those men did that. The main group of soldiers was north of the city, and the
others were hiding west of the city. That night Joshua went down into the valley.
14 When the king of Ai saw the Israeli army, he and his soldiers got up early the
next morning and quickly went out of the city to fight them. They went to a place
east of the city, but they did not know that some Israeli soldiers were hiding behind
the city.
15 Joshua and the Israeli soldiers who were with him allowed the army of Ai to push
them back. They ran toward the desert.
16 The men in Ai were ordered to chase after Joshua and his men. So they left the
city and started to pursue the Israelis.
17 All the men of Ai and the men of Bethel pursued the Israeli army. They did not
leave even one man in Ai to defend it. The gates of the city were left wide open.
18 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “Lift up your spear and point it toward Ai, because
I am going to enable your soldiers to capture it!” So Joshua pointed his spear toward
Ai.
19 When the Israeli men who were hiding saw that, they rushed out from the places
where they were hiding and ran into the city. They quickly captured it and set it on
fire.
20 When the men of Ai looked back, they saw smoke rising from their city. But they
could not escape, because the Israeli troops stopped running away.
21 Joshua and his men saw that the men who had been hiding had captured the
city and were burning it, and they saw the smoke rising. So they turned around and
started to attack the men of Ai.
22 Meanwhile, the soldiers who had captured the city came out and attacked them
from the rear. So the men of Ai were caught between the two groups of Israeli soldiers.
None of the men of Ai escaped. The Israelis fought until they killed all of them. Only
the king of Ai was still alive.
23 Then they seized the king of Ai and brought him to Joshua.
A summary of the battle
24 While they were fighting, the Israeli army pursued the men of Ai into the fields
and into the desert, and killed all of them. Then they went to Ai and killed everyone
who was there.
25 They killed 12,000 men and women.
26 Joshua continued to point his spear [LIT] toward Ai, until all the people in Ai had
been killed.
belonged to the people of Ai, just like Yahweh had told Joshua that they should do.
28 Joshua and his soldiers burned Ai city and caused it to become a pile of ruins. It
is still like that today.
29 Joshua hanged the king of Ai on a tree and left his corpse hanging there until the
evening. At sunset Joshua told his men to take the king’s corpse down from the tree
and to throw it on the ground at the city gate. After they did that, they piled a lot of
rocks on top of the corpse, and that pile of rocks is still there.
Joshua repeated Yahweh’s agreement with the Israeli people
30 Joshua told his men to build on Ebal Mountain an altar for Yahweh, the God who
is worshiped by the Israeli people.
31 They built it just like Moses, the man who served God well, had written previously
in the laws that God had given to him. They made it from stones that had not
JOSHUA 8:32
321
JOSHUA 9:10
been cut using iron tools. The Israelis then offered sacrifices to Yahweh that were
burned completely on the altar. They also offered sacrifices to restore fellowship with
Yahweh.
32 As the Israelis watched, Joshua wrote on stones the laws that Yahweh had given
to Moses previously.
33 The Israeli leaders, the officials, the judges, and other Israelis were there, standing
nearby. Many people who were not Israelis were also there. Half of the people stood
on one side of the valley below Ebal Mountain, and the other half of the people stood
on the other side of the valley below Gerizim Mountain. The sacred chest was in the
valley between the two groups. That was what Moses had previously commanded
that the people should do when Yahweh was about to bless them.
34 Then Joshua read to the people all that Moses had written previously. That
included what Yahweh had taught them and the ways that he promised to bless them
if they obeyed his commands, or to curse them if they disobeyed them.
35 All the Israelis gathered together to listen—the men, the women, and the children.
The ◄foreigners/people who were not Israelis► who were living among them also
listened, while Joshua read all the commands that Moses had written.

The Gibeonites tricked the Israelis
Jordan River. They were the kings of the Heth people-group, the Amor people-group,
the Canaan people-group, the Periz people-group, the Hiv people-group, and the Jebus
people-group. They lived in the hilly area, in the foothills further west, and on the
plains along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. They heard about what happened at
Ai.
3 When the people who lived in Gibeon city heard that Joshua’s army had defeated
4 they decided to trick the Israelis. They gathered some old sacks and some old
on the backs of their donkeys.
5 They put on old sandals that had been patched, and wore old ragged clothes. And
they took along bread that was dry and moldy.
6 They traveled to where Joshua and the other Israelis had set up their tents near
Gilgal. They said to Joshua and the other Israeli leaders, “We have traveled from a
distant land. We want you to make a peace agreement with us.”
7 The Israeli leaders said to those men from Gilead who were from the Hiv peoplegroup, “We do not know if you truly live far from us. If you live near us, we cannot
[RHQ] make a peace agreement with you, because God has commanded us to get rid
of the people that are living near us.”
8 They replied to Joshua, “If you make a peace agreement with us, we will be your
servants.”
But Joshua answered, “What people-group are you? Where do you come from?”
9 The men from Gibeon answered, “We want to be your servants. We have come
here from a distant land, because we have heard about the great things that your god
has done. We have heard about everything that he did in Egypt to help you.

11 So our leaders and the rest of our people said to us, ‘Take some food and go to
talk with the Israelis. Tell them, “We want to be your servants. So make a peace
agreement with us.” ’

that we left our area, but now it is dry and moldy.
13 Look at our leather wine bags. They were new when we filled them with wine
before we left, but now they are cracked and old. Our clothes and our sandals are
worn out from traveling on the long road to come here.”
14 The Israeli leaders tasted the bread, but they did not ask Yahweh what to do.
15 So Joshua agreed to make a peace agreement with the men from Gibeon to not
kill them. All the Israeli leaders vowed to do what Joshua said in the agreement. Then
the men from Gibeon returned home.
16 Three days later the Israelis found out that the men from Gibeon lived nearby.
17 So they went to where the men from Gibeon lived. After traveling only three
days, they came to their cities: Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-Jearim.
18 But the Israelis did not attack the people of those cities, because they had
promised to live peacefully with them, and Yahweh had heard them promise to do
that.
All the Israeli people grumbled against their leaders for doing that.
19 But the leaders answered, “We promised to live peacefully with them, and Yahweh,
the God whom we Israelis worship, heard us promise to do that. So now we cannot
attack [EUP] them.
20 This is what we will do: We will not kill them. If we kill them, God will be very
angry with us and punish us because of not doing what we promised to do.
21 So we must allow them to live. But they will cut wood for us, and they will carry
water for us.” So the Israeli leaders did what they had promised.
to us? Your land was near to where we had set up our tents, but you told us that you
23 So now you will become our slaves. You will always be forced to cut wood and
carry water for us Israeli people who worship in the temple of our God.”
24 The men from Gibeon replied, “We lied to you because we were afraid that you
would kill us. We heard that Yahweh, your God, declared to his servant Moses that
he would enable you to conquer all the people in this land and to kill all the people
who lived in it.
25 So now you can decide what you will do with us. Do what you think is right.”
26 So Joshua saved the lives of the people of Gibeon by not allowing the Israelis to
kill them.
27 Instead, he forced them to become the Israelis’ slaves. They cut wood and carried
water for the Israelis. They also brought the wood and water that was needed for the
sacred altar of Yahweh, to whatever place Yahweh decided that they should build
one. And the people of Gibeon are still doing that.

Joshua’s army defeated the descendants of Amor when God made the sun stand still
1 Later, Adonizedek, the king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua’s army had captured
Ai town and had destroyed everything in the town. He heard that they had done to
the people of Ai and to their king the same thing that they had done to the people
of Jericho and their king. He also heard that the people of Gibeon city had made a
JOSHUA 10:2
323
JOSHUA 10:15
peace treaty with the Israeli people, and that the people of Gibeon were now living
near the Israelis and being protected by them.
2 Because of that, he and the people whom he ruled became very afraid, because
Gibeon was an important city, like the other cities that had kings. And even though
Gibeon was a larger city than Ai and all its soldiers were good fighters, they thought
Joshua’s army might defeat them.
3 So King Adonizedek sent a message to Hosham the king of Hebron city, to Piram
the king of Jarmuth city, to Jarmuth the king of Lachish city, and to Debir the king of
Eglon city.
4 In the message he said, “Please come up with your armies and help me to attack
Gibeon, because the people of Gibeon have made a peace treaty with Joshua and the
Israelis.”
5 So those five kings who ruled all the groups who were descendants of Amor—the
kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Debir—came up with all of their
soldiers and surrounded the city. Then they prepared to attack it.
6 So the people of Gibeon sent a message to Joshua while he was in the camp at
Gilgal. They said, “We are your servants. So do not forsake us. Come up to us quickly
and save us! Help us, because the kings of all of the groups descended from Amor
and their armies have joined their forces and have come from the hilly area to attack
us!”
7 So Joshua and all his army, including the soldiers who were his best fighting men,
marched up from Gilgal.
8 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of those armies! I will enable your
your army.”
10 They attacked their enemies before anyone knew that they had come. Yahweh
they saw the Israeli army. As a result, the Israeli army defeated them very severely
to Beth-Horon. But the Israeli army pursued them and killed them all along the road
that goes to Azekah and Makkedah towns.
11 As they fled in front of the Israeli army, Yahweh threw down huge hailstones
from the sky. As a result, more of them died from hailstones falling on them than
died as a result of the Israeli army killing them with swords.
12 On the day that Yahweh enabled the Israeli army to defeat the groups who were
descendants of Amor, Joshua said to Yahweh while the Israeli people were listening,
“Yahweh, cause the sun to stand still over Gibeon, and cause the moon to not move
when it is over Aijalon Valley.”
13 And that is what happened. The sun stood still, and the moon did not move, until
the Israeli army defeated their enemies. That is what has been written in the book
that Jashar wrote. The sun stopped while it was in the middle of the sky, and did not
◄set/go down► for about a whole day.
14 On that day Yahweh did a great miracle that someone asked him to do. There
was never a day like that previously, and there has never been a day like that since.
Yahweh was certainly fighting for the Israeli people!
15 After Joshua’s army defeated their enemies, they all returned to their camp at
Gilgal.
Joshua’s army defeated the armies of five kings
JOSHUA 10:16
324
JOSHUA 10:35
16 While the enemy soldiers were fleeing from Joshua’s army, their five kings also
fled and hid in a cave at Makkedah town.
17 Then someone told Joshua, “We found those five kings, hiding in a cave at
Makkedah!”
18 When Joshua heard that, he said, “Roll some very large rocks to the entrance of
the cave so that the kings cannot escape, and leave some soldiers there to guard it.
19 But do not stay there! Pursue our enemies! Attack them from behind! Do not
allow them to escape to their cities, because Yahweh, our God, will enable you to
defeat/kill them. [IDM]”
20 So Joshua’s army did what he told them to do. They killed almost all of the enemy
soldiers, but a few of them were able to reach their cities and be safe inside the walls
of the cities.
21 Then Joshua’s army returned to Joshua, who was still in their camp at Makkedah.
No one in the land dared to criticize [MTY] the Israelis.
22 Then Joshua said, “Open the entrance of the cave, and bring out to me those five
kings!”
23 So the soldiers brought those five kings out of the cave—the kings of Jerusalem,
Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon.
24 When they brought those kings to Joshua and forced them to lie on the ground, he
summoned all the Israeli soldiers, and then he said to the army commanders, “Come
here and put your feet on the necks of these kings!” So the commanders did that.
25 Then Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid of any of our enemies! Never be
discouraged! Be strong and courageous. This is what Yahweh will do to all the
26 Then Joshua killed each of the five kings with his sword, and told his soldiers to
hanging on the trees until sunset.
27 At sunset, Joshua told them to take the bodies down from the trees and throw
them into the cave where they had been hiding. So the soldiers did that, and then
they put those large rocks at the entrance of the cave again. Those rocks are still
there.
28 That is how Joshua’s army attacked and captured Makkedah. They killed the king
and everyone else in the town. They did not leave anyone alive. They did to the king
of Makkedah the same thing that they had done to the king of Jericho.
They conquered the southern cities
29 That same day, Joshua and his Israeli army went southwest from Makkedah to
Libnah city and attacked it.
30 Yahweh enabled the Israelis to conquer [MTY] that city and its king. They killed
everyone in the city; they did not ◄spare anyone/allow anyone to remain alive►.
They killed the king of Libnah just like they had killed the king of Jericho.
31 Then Joshua and his army went south from Libnah to Lachish city.
They
surrounded the city and attacked it.
32 On the second day of the battle, Yahweh enabled the Israelis to conquer [MTY]
the city. And like they had done at Libnah, they killed everyone [DOU] in the city.
33 King Horam from Gezer city and his army came to help the soldiers of Lachish,
but Joshua’s army defeated Horam and his army, and did not allow any of them to
remain alive.
34 Then Joshua and his army went west from Lachish to Eglon city. They surrounded
the city and attacked it.
35 On that day, they captured the city and killed [MTY] everyone in it [DOU], just
like they had done at Lachish.
JOSHUA 10:36
325
JOSHUA 11:9
36 Then Joshua and his army went west from Eglon up into the hills to Hebron city.
They attacked the city
37 and captured it. They killed the king and everyone else, just like they had done
at Eglon. They did not allow anyone to remain alive.
38 Then Joshua and his army turned south and went to Debir city and attacked it.
39 They captured the city and its king, and also captured the nearby towns. Then
they killed everyone [DOU]; they did to the people there the same thing that they had
done at Hebron and Libnah.
40 That is how Joshua and his army conquered the entire southern part of Canaan.
They defeated the kings who ruled the hilly area, the dry southern area, the western
foothills, and the eastern slopes. They killed everyone [DOU] in those areas; they did
not allow anyone to remain alive.
41 Joshua’s soldiers captured all the cities from Kadesh-Barnea city in the far south
42 At that one time, Joshua’s army conquered all the kings and captured all the
the Israeli people worship, was fighting for them.
11
Joshua’s army captured towns in the north
1 When King Jabin of Hazor city heard about all those things that had happened, he
sent messages to Jobab, the king of Madon city, to the king of Shimron city, and to
the king of Acshaph city, requesting them to send their armies to come and help him
fight against the Israelis.
2 He also sent messages to the kings in the northern hilly area and to the kings
in the Jordan River Valley, south of Galilee Lake and in the western hills. He sent a
message to the king of Naphoth-Dor in the west
3 and to the kings of the Canaan people-group in the eastern and western parts of
the land. He sent messages to the Amor people-group and the Heth people-group and
the Periz people-group and the Jebus people-group who lived in the hilly area. He
also sent a message to the Hiv people-group who lived below Hermon Mountain in
the Mizpah area.
4 So the armies of all those kings gathered together, bringing their horses and
chariots. There seemed to be [HYP] as many soldiers as grains of sand on the seashore.
5 All of those kings and their armies gathered together at Merom Pond, and they set
up their tents there. Then they made plans to fight against the Israelis.
6 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, because at this time
tomorrow I will enable your men to defeat them. Your men must also cripple their
horses and burn their chariots.”
7 So Joshua and his army traveled to Merom Pond and attacked their enemies ◄by
surprise/before they were ready to fight►.
8 Yahweh enabled the Israelis to defeat them. They pursued them to Sidon city
in the far north, and to Misrephoth-Maim in the northwest, and to Mizpah Valley in
the northeast. The Israelis fought them until ◄they were all dead/there were no
survivors►.
9 Then Joshua and his men did what Yahweh told them to do: They crippled their
enemies’ horses and burned their chariots.
JOSHUA 11:10
326
JOSHUA 12:2
10 The king of Hazor had ruled the people of all the kingdoms whose armies had
fought against the Israelis. So Joshua’s army went back to Hazor and captured that
city and killed their king.
11 They killed everyone in Hazor; ◄they did not spare anyone/no one was left alive►
[DOU]. Then they burned the city.
12 Joshua’s army captured all of those cities and killed all of their kings. They did
that like Moses, the man who served Yahweh well, had commanded them to do.
13 Joshua’s men burned Hazor city, but they did not burn any of the other cities
that were built on small hills.
14 The Israelis took for themselves the animals that they found in those cities and
15 Many years before, Yahweh had told Moses to do that, and then Moses told Joshua
16 Joshua’s army defeated all the people who were living in that land. They took
control over the hilly area and the area in the southern part of Canaan, all the area
of Goshen, the western foothills, and the Jordan River Valley. They took control over
all the mountains in Israel and all the hills near the mountains.
17 They took control of all the land from Halak Mountain in the south up to the Seir
hilly area as far as Baal-Gaal in Lebanon Valley in the north, at the bottom of Hermon
Mountain. They captured all the kings of those areas and killed them.
18 Joshua’s men fought against those groups for many years.
19 There was only one group that made a peace agreement with the Israelis; they
were the people of the Hiv people-group who lived in Gibeon. The Israelis captured
all the other towns in battles.
20 Yahweh caused the people in all those other groups to be stubborn [IDM], with
the result that they fought against the Israeli army, and the Israelis killed them all.
They were not merciful to any of them. That is what Yahweh had commanded Moses
to do.
21 Joshua’s army also fought the Anak people-group who lived in the hills near
Hebron, Debir, and Anah cities. They also fought against the people who lived in the
hilly area of Judah and Israel, and they killed all of those people and destroyed their
cities.
22 As a result, there were no descendants of Anak who remained alive in Israel.
Only a few remained alive in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod cities.
23 Joshua’s army took control of all the land, just as Yahweh long ago had told Moses
to do. Yahweh gave the land to the Israelis, because he had promised to give it to
them. Then Joshua divided the land among the Israeli tribes. After that, there was
◄peace/no more battles► in the land.
12
The kings defeated by the Israelis
1 The Israelis took control of the land that was east of the Jordan River, from the
Arnon River gorge in the south to Hermon Mountain in the north, including all the
land on the eastern side of the Jordan River Valley. That land previously belonged to
the two kings whose armies the Israelis defeated.
2 One of them was Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group. He lived in Heshbon
city and ruled over the area from Aroer town along the Arnon River Gorge, north to
the Jabbok River. His land started in the middle of the gorge, which was the border
between his land and the land of the Ammon people-group. Sihon also ruled over the
southern half of the Gilead region,
JOSHUA 12:3
327
JOSHUA 13:3
3 and over the land on the eastern side of the Jordan River Valley, from Galilee Lake
south to the Dead Sea. He also ruled over the land east of the Dead Sea from BethJeshimoth south to the side of Pisgah Mountain.
region. He was the last of the descendants of the giant Rapha. He ruled that land,
5 He ruled over the area from Hermon Mountain and Salecah in the north, and over
Maacah to the west. Og ruled the northern half of the Gilead region, as far as the
6 Moses, the man who served Yahweh well, and all the Israeli army defeated the
armies of those kings. Then Moses gave that land to the tribes of Reuben and Gad
and half of the tribe of Manasseh.
7 Joshua and the Israeli army also defeated kings who ruled over the land on the
west side of the Jordan River. He gave that land to the Israeli people, dividing it
among the other tribes. That land was between Baal-Gad city in the Lebanon Valley
in the far north all the way south to Halak Mountain, which is near the land of the
Edom people-group.
8 That land included the mountains, the western hilly area, the Jordan River Valley,
the western slopes of the mountains, the desert in Judea, and the Negev desert in the
south. That whole area was the land where the Heth, Amor, Canaan, Periz, Hiv, and
Jebus people-groups lived. The Israeli army defeated the armies of the kings of each
of these cities:
9 Jericho, Ai (which was near Bethel),
11 Jarmuth, Lachish,
13 Debir, Geder,
14 Hormah, Arad,
15 Libnah, Adullam,
16 Makkedah, Bethel,
17 Tappuah, Hepher,
18 Aphek, Lasharon,
19 Madon, Hazor,
20 Shimron Meron, Acshaph,
22 Kedesh, Jokneam in the Carmel area,
23 Dor in the Naphoth-Dor area, Goyim in the Gilgal area,
24 and Tirzah.
There was a total of 31 kings that the Israeli army defeated.
13
The areas that the Israelis had not yet captured
1 When Joshua was very old, Yahweh said to him, “Joshua, you are now an old man,
but there is still a lot of land for your army to capture.
2 Here is a list of the land that remains: The Geshur region and all the area where
the Philistia people-group live;
3 the area where the Canaan people-group live, from the Shihor River in the south
at the eastern border of Egypt, to Ekron city in the north; the rulers of the five cities
JOSHUA 13:4
328
JOSHUA 13:23
of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron; the area where the Avva people-group
live,
4 which is south of the area where the Canaan people-group live;
5 the area where the Gebal people-group live; and all the Lebanon area east of
Baal-Gad city at the bottom of Hermon Mountain, as far as Lebo-Hamath.
6 All the people of the Sidon people-group live in the hilly area from Lebanon to
Misrephoth-Maim, but I will force them to leave that area before you Israelis arrive
there. Be sure to give that area to the Israeli people when you divide the land among
them, like I told you to do.
7 Divide all that land among the nine Israeli tribes and half of the tribe of Manasseh,
the tribes that do not have land on the east side of the Jordan River.”
The land east of the Jordan River
8 Half of the tribe of Manasseh and the tribes of Reuben and Gad had already been
told what land they would receive, because Moses, the man who served Yahweh well,
had already assigned to them the land on the east side of the Jordan River.
9 Their land extended from Aroer town at the Arnon River gorge to the town in the
middle of the gorge. It included the whole plain from Medeba town south to Dibon
town.
10 All the towns ruled by King Sihon were in that area. The land extended to where
the Ammon people-group lived.
11 The Gilead area was also there, and the regions where the people of the Geshur and
Maacah people-groups lived, and all of Hermon Mountain and all the Bashan region
south to Salecah.
12 All the land ruled by Og, the king who ruled the Bashan region, was in that land.
Og was one of the last descendants of Repha; previously he had ruled in Ashtaroth
and Edrei cities, but the armies of Moses had defeated their armies and had taken
their land from them.
13 But the Israelis did not force the people of the Geshur and Maacah people-groups
to leave their land, so they still live among the Israeli people.
14 The tribe of Levi was the only tribe that did not get any land. Instead, just like
Yahweh promised, they continued to receive food from the sacrifices that were given
to Yahweh, the God whom the Israelis worship, the sacrifices that were burned on the
sacred altar.
15 Moses had allotted land to each clan in the tribe of Reuben.
16 Their land extended from Aroer town near the Arnon River gorge to Medeba
town. That included all of the plain that is near Medeba and the town in the middle
of the gorge.
17 It also included Heshbon city and all the nearby towns on the plain—Dibon,
Bamioth-Baal, Beth-Baal-Meon,
18 Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,
19 Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth-Shahar on the hill overlooking the valley,
20 Beth-Peor, the hills in the Pisgah area, and Beth-Jeshimoth.

JOSHUA 13:24
329
JOSHUA 14:9
24 Moses also allotted some land to each clan in the tribe of Gad.
25 Their land included the Jazer area and all the towns of the Gilead area; half of
the land where the Ammon people-group lived, as far as Aroer town which is near
Rabbah town;
26 the area from Heshbon city to Ramath-Mizpah and Betonim towns; the area from
Mahanaim town to the Debir region;
27 Beth-Haram, Beth-Nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon cities in the valley; and the other
area that King Sihon had ruled on the east side of the Jordan River. That area extended
north to the southern end of Galilee Lake.
28 All this land, including the towns and villages, was allotted to the tribe of Gad.
29 Moses also had allotted some of the land on the east side of the Jordan River to
half of the tribe of Manasseh.
30 Their land extended north from Mahanaim city. It included all the Bashan region,
all the land that King Og had ruled, and all the towns in the Jair area in Bashan.
Altogether that area included 60 towns.
31 Their area also included half of the Gilead region, and the cities of Ashtaroth and
Edrei where King Og had ruled. All that area was allotted to the clans descended
from Manasseh’s son Makir.
32 Moses had allotted to those tribes the land that was on the plain of the Moab
region, on the east side of the Jordan River, across from Jericho.
33 But Moses did not allot any land to the tribe of Levi because Yahweh, the God
whom we Israelis worship, promised that he himself would always provide for them.
14
The land west of the Jordan River
1 Eleazar the Supreme Priest, Joshua, and the leaders of the twelve tribes repeated
what land would be allotted to each of the Israeli tribes in Canaan.
2-5 Yahweh had told Moses many years previously in what way he wanted the
division of the land to be decided. Moses had already declared that two and a half
tribes would be allotted land on the east side of the Jordan River. Joseph had two
sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. Half of the tribe descended from Manasseh was allotted
land on the east side of the Jordan, along with the tribes of Reuben and Gad. The people
belonging to the nine and a half other tribes on the west side of the Jordan River threw
◄lots/stones that had been marked► to decide which land each tribe would receive.
The tribe of Levi was not allotted any land. They received only towns that already
existed, towns in which to live, and ◄pastures/fields of grass► for their animals.
Land for Caleb
6 One day some men from the tribe of Judah went to Joshua while he and all the
Israelis were at Gilgal. Among those men was Jephunneh’s son Caleb. He said to
Joshua, “I am sure that you remember what Yahweh said to the prophet Moses about
you and me when we were at Kadesh-Barnea.
7 I was 40 years old at that time. Moses sent me and you and some other men to
explore this land. When we returned, I gave to Moses a true report [IDM] about what
we had seen.
8 The other men who went with us gave a report that caused the people to be afraid
[IDM]. But I fully/completely believed that Yahweh would enable us to take the land
from the people who lived there.
9 So on that day, Moses solemnly promised me, ‘Some of the land on which you
walked will become yours. It will belong to your descendants forever. I am giving it
to you because you fully trusted in Yahweh, my God.’
JOSHUA 14:10
330
JOSHUA 15:10
10 “Now Yahweh has done for me what he promised. Forty-five years have passed
since Moses said that to me during the time that we were wandering around in the
desert. And just like Yahweh promised, he has kept me alive and well all during that
time. Now I am eighty-five years old.
11 I am as strong today as I was on the day that Moses sent me to explore this land.
I am as ready to fight now as I was then.
12 So please give me the hilly area that Yahweh promised to give to me at that time
long ago. At that time, you heard me say that the Amalek people-group lived there.
You heard me say that their cities were large, and they had walls around them to
protect them from attacks by their enemies. But now, Yahweh will help me, and as a
result I will force them to leave, just like Yahweh said would happen.”
13 So Joshua asked God to bless Caleb, and he gave to Caleb the city of Hebron.
14-15 Previously that city was called Kiriath-Arba, because Arba was the greatest
Caleb, because Caleb completely/fully trusted in Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis
After that happened, there was ◄peace/no battles► in Canaan land for many years.
15
Land for the tribe of Judah
1 The land that was allotted to the tribe of Judah was divided among its clans. That
land extended south along the border of the Edom region, as far as the Zin Desert.
2 The southern border of the land that was allotted to the tribe of Judah started
at the south end of the Dead Sea and extended west.
3 It extended south of Scorpion Pass to Zin Desert, and from there west to a place
south of Kadesh-Barnea, past Hezron town, to Addar town, and from there it turned
northwest to Karka town.
4 From there it continued to Azmon, and from there to the dry riverbed on the
border of Egypt, and from there west to the Mediterranean Sea. That was the southern
border.
5 The eastern border of the land of the tribe of Judah was the Dead Sea, and it
extended north to where the Jordan River ends at the Dead Sea.
6 The northern border started where the Jordan River ends at the Dead Sea. It
extended north to Beth-Hoglah town, and from there it extended north of BethArabah town to the big stone set up by Reuben’s son Bohan.
7 From there the border continued west through Achor Valley to Debir city. From
there it turned north to Gilgal city. Gilgal is north of the road that goes through
Adummim Pass, on the south side of the valley. From Gilgal the border extended
west to the springs at En-Shemesh, and from there to En-Rogel.
8 From there it extended through Ben-Hinnom Valley, south of the city where the
Jebus people-group lived. (That city is now named Jerusalem.) From there the border
extended to the top of the hill on the west side of Hinnom Valley, at the northern end
of the valley where the Repha giants lived.
9 From there the border extended northwest to Nephtoah Spring, and from there
to the cities near Ephron Mountain. From there the border extended west toward
Baalah, which is now named Kiriath-Jearim.
10 Then the border extended further west to Seir Mountain. Then it continued
southwest along the north side of Jearim Mountain, which is also named Kesalon, to
Beth-Shemesh city. From there it extended northwest past Timnah city,
JOSHUA 15:11
331
JOSHUA 15:41
11 to the hill north of Ekron city. From there it extended west to Shikkeron town
and past Baalah Mountain to Jabneel town, then northwest to the Mediterranean Sea.
12 The western border of the land that was allotted to the tribe of Judah was the
Mediterranean Sea. All the clans of Judah lived inside those borders.
13 Yahweh commanded Joshua to give part of the land for the tribe of Judah to
Caleb. So he gave to Caleb Kiriath-Arba city, which is now named Hebron. (Arba was
the ancestor of the Anak people-group.)
14 Caleb forced the three clans of the Anak people-group to leave Hebron. Those
were the Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai clans.
15 Then Caleb left there and went to fight against the people living in Debir city,
which was previously named Kiriath-Sepher.
16 Caleb said, “If someone attacks the people in Kiriath-Sepher and captures their
17 Othniel, the son of Caleb’s brother Kenaz, captured the city. So Caleb gave his
daughter to him.
18 When Caleb’s daughter married Othniel, she told him to ask her father to give
her a field. Then Acsah went to talk with her father Caleb. As she got down from her
donkey, Caleb asked her, “Do you want something?”
19 Acsah replied, “Yes, I want you to do something for me. You have given me some
land in the southern part of Canaan, but there is no water there. So please give me
some land that has springs.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs near
Hebron.
20 Here is a list of the towns in the land that God had promised to give to the tribe
of Judah. Each clan was allotted some of the land.
21 The tribe of Judah was allotted all these towns in the southern desert area of Canaan,
near the border of the Edom region:
Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,
22 Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,
24 Ziph, Telem, Bealoth,
25 Hazor-Hadattah, Kerioth-Hezron (which is also named Hazor),
26 Amam, Shema, Molodah,
27 Hazar-Gaddah, Heshmon, Beth-Pelet,

48 The tribe of Judah was also allotted these towns in the southwest part of the
hilly region: Shamir, Jattir, Socoh,
49 Dannah, Kiriath-Sannah (which is now named Debir),
50 Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim,
51 Goshen, Holon, and Giloh. There were eleven towns with their surrounding

63 The army of the tribe of Judah was not able to force the people of the Jebus peoplegroup to leave Jerusalem. So the people of that group are still living among the tribe
of Judah.

Land for the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh
1 The land that was allotted to the two tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh that were
descended from Joseph started at the Jordan River, east of the springs at Jericho.
2 It extended west from Jericho to the hilly area near Bethel, which is also called
Luz. It extended as far as Ataroth, at the border of the land where the Arki peoplegroup lived.
3 From there it extended west to the border of the land where the Japhleti peoplegroup lived, and then it extended west to the area near Lower Beth-Horon. From
there it extended west to Gezer city and from there to the Mediterranean Sea.
JOSHUA 16:4
333
JOSHUA 17:11
4 That is the land that the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh were allotted.
5 The border of the land that was allotted to the clans of the tribe of Ephraim started
at Ataroth-Addar city in the east. It extended to Upper Beth-Horon
7 From Michmethath on the north it extended east to Taanath and from there on to
Janoah. From there it extended south to Ataroth city and to Naarah town. From there
it extended to Jericho and from there to the Jordan River.
8 The northern border extended from Tappuah west to Kanah Ravine, and ended at
the Mediterranean Sea. That was the land that was allotted to the tribe of Ephraim.
9 Many of those towns were really within the area allotted to the tribe of Manasseh.
10 The people of the tribe of Ephraim could not force the Canaan people-group to
leave Gezer, so the Canaan people-group still live among the people of the tribe of
Ephraim, but the Israelis forced the people of the Canaan people-group to become
their slaves.
17
1 This is a list of the land that was allotted to the tribe of Manasseh.
Manasseh’s
oldest son was Makir and his grandson was Gilead. Makir’s descendants were great
warriors, so the lands in the Gilead and Bashan regions were allotted to their clan.
2 Land was also allotted to the other clans of the tribe of Manasseh: The clans of
Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida.
3 Hepher’s son Zelophehad had no sons, but he had five daughters: Mahlah, Noah,
Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
4 They went to Eleazar the Supreme Priest, and to Joshua and to the other Israeli
leaders. They said, “We want you to give us some land, because Yahweh told Moses
that he should give to us some land, just like you gave to the men.” So Eleazar did
what Yahweh had commanded, and he allotted to them some land, just like he allotted
to their uncles.
5 So the tribe of Manasseh eventually had ten sections of land west of the Jordan
River and two sections, Gilead and Bashan, on the east side of the Jordan River.
6 So those female descendants of Manasseh also were allotted land on the west side
of the river just like the men were allotted. The other parts of the Gilead area were
allotted to the male descendants of Manasseh.
7 The land allotted to the tribe of Manasseh was between the land where the tribe
of Asher lives and Michmethath town, near Shechem city. The border extended
south to the Tappuah Spring.
8 The land near the Tappuah area belonged to the tribe of Manasseh, but the
town of Tappuah, which was at the border of the land that was allotted to the tribe
of Manasseh, was allotted to the tribe of Ephraim.
9 The border of the land allotted to the tribe of Manasseh extended south to Kanah
Gorge. From there it extended west along the north side of the gorge and ended at
the Mediterranean Sea.
10 The land on the south side of the gorge belonged to the tribe of Ephraim, and
the land on the north side belonged to the tribe of Manasseh. The western border of
the land allotted to the tribe of Manasseh was the Mediterranean Sea. To the north,
the border of their land extended from the land allotted to the tribe of Asher at the
northwest to the land allotted to the tribe of Issachar at the northeast.
11 But there are cities inside the area allotted to the tribes of Issachar and Asher.
Those cities, along with their surrounding villages, were allotted to people from the
tribe of Manasseh. These cities are Beth-Shan, Ibleam, Dor (which is also named
Naphoth-Dor,) Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo.
12 The men of the tribe of Manasseh were not able to force the people who lived in
those cities to leave, so the people of the Canaan people-group continued to live in
those cities.
13 But years later when the Israelis became better warriors, they forced the Canaan
people-group to work for them as slaves, although they did not force them to leave
14 The people of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh said to Joshua, “You allotted
to us only one area of land, but there are a lot of us. Yahweh has blessed us very
much with the result that our tribe has grown very large. So why did you give us only
a small part of the land [RHQ]?”
15 Joshua replied to them, “I agree that you do not have enough land in the hilly
area of the tribe of Ephraim. So, since you have a lot of people, I will allot more land
to you, in the hilly region. But you will have to cut down the trees in the forest and
make a place for yourselves in the land where the Periz and Repha people-groups
live.”
16 The people of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh replied, “It is true that the
land in the hilly area is not big enough for us, but the Canaan people-group who live
in the lowlands, in Beth-Shan and the surrounding villages in that area, and in the
Jezreel Valley, have iron chariots, so we will not be able to defeat them!”
17 Joshua replied to them, “Your tribe is very numerous and very powerful. So I
will allot more land for you in the hilly area,
18 but you will have to cut down the trees in order to make a place for you to live.
It is true that the Canaan people-group are strong and have iron chariots, but you
will be able to force them to leave that valley.”
18
The rest of the land was allotted
1-2 The Israeli people captured all the land that they were able to, but there were
still seven tribes that had not been allotted any land. The Israeli people all gathered
at Shiloh, and they set up the Sacred Tent there.
3 Joshua said to them, “Why are you waiting a long time to take control of the rest
of the land that Yahweh, the God whom your ancestors worshiped, has promised to
give to you [RHQ]?
4 Choose three men from each of your seven tribes. Then I will send them to explore
the parts of the land which you have not occupied yet. When they finish exploring it,
they must write a report, in which they will ◄make a map/show the boundaries► of
the land that each tribe wants to receive.
5 They will divide the remaining land into seven parts. The tribe of Judah will keep
its land in the south, and the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh will keep their land in
the north.
6 But in their report, the men from the seven tribes should describe the seven parts
of the remaining land that they wish to receive, and bring the report to me. While
Yahweh is watching, I will ◄cast lots/throw marked stones► to decide which land
should be allotted to each tribe.
7 But the tribe of Levi will not be allotted any land, because their reward is that they
have already been allotted their land on the east side of the Jordan River, just as
8 When the men who were chosen got ready to leave, Joshua told them, “Go and
explore the land. Then write a report of what you have seen, and bring it back to
JOSHUA 18:9
335
JOSHUA 18:28
me. Then while Yahweh is watching, I will ◄cast lots/throw marked stones► here at
Shiloh, to determine what area each tribe will receive.”
9 So the men left and walked through the area. Then they described in a scroll each
town that was in the seven parts into which they had divided the land. Then they
returned to Joshua, who was still at Shiloh.
10 After Joshua read their report, while Yahweh was watching, he ◄cast lots/threw
marked stones► to choose which land would be allotted to each of the seven Israeli
tribes.
The land for the tribe of Benjamin
11 The first tribe that was allotted land was the tribe of Benjamin. Each clan in that
tribe was allotted some of the land that was between the area that was allotted to the
tribe of Judah and the area that was allotted to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh.
12 The northern border started at the Jordan River and extended west along the
northern side of Jericho, into the hilly area. From there the border extended west
to the desert near Beth-Aven town.
13 From there it extended southwest to Luz (which is now named Bethel). From
there it extended southwest to Ataroth-Addar town, which is on the hill south of
Lower Beth-Horon city.
14 At the hill south of Beth-Horon, the border turned and extended south to
Kiriath-Baal town, which is also named Kiriath-Jearim. That is a town where people
of the tribe of Judah live. That was the western border of the land allotted to the
tribe of Benjamin.
15 The southern border of their land started near Kiriath-Jearim and extended
west to Nephtoah Springs.
16 From there it extended south to the bottom of the hill, near Ben-Hinnom Valley,
on the north side of Repha Valley. The border extended south along the Hinnom
Valley, south of the city where the Jebus people-group lived, to En-Rogel.
17 From there the border extended west to En-Shemesh, and continued to Geliloth
near Adummim Pass. Then it extended to the great stone of Reuben’s son Bohan.
18 From there the border extended to the northern edge of Beth-Arabah town and
down into the Jordan River Valley.
19 From there it extended east to the northern edge of Beth-Hoglah town and
ended at the north end of the Dead Sea, where the Jordan River flows into the Dead
Sea. That was the southern boundary of the land allotted to the tribe of Benjamin.
20 The Jordan River was the eastern boundary of the land allotted to the tribe of
Benjamin. Those were the boundaries of the land allotted to them.
21 The cities in the land allotted to the tribe of Benjamin were Jericho, Beth-Hoglah,
Emek-Keziz,
22 Beth-Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,
23 Avvim, Parah, Ophrah,
24 Kephar-Ammoni, Ophni, and Geba. Altogether there were fourteen towns and the
25 The tribe of Benjamin also had the towns of Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,
27 Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,
named Jerusalem), Gibeah, and Kiriath. Altogether there were 14 towns and the
surrounding villages. All that area was allotted to the clans of the tribe of Benjamin.

1 The second/next tribe that was allotted land was the tribe of Simeon.
Each clan
in that tribe was allotted some land that was inside the area that had been allotted
to the tribe of Judah.

7 The land allotted to them also included the four cities of Ain, Rimmon, Ether,
and Ashan, and their surrounding villages.
8 They were also allotted some very small villages in an area that extended south
to Baalath-Beer (which is also named Ramah, in the southern desert). That was the
land allotted to the clans of the tribe of Simeon.
9 The tribe of Judah had been allotted much more land than they needed, so part of
their land was given to the tribe of Simeon.
Land for the tribe of Zebulun
10 The third/next tribe that was allotted land was the tribe of Zebulun. Each clan of
that tribe was allotted some of the land.
The southern border started at Sarid city.
11 It extended west to Maralah city and on to Dabbesheth city, and on to the brook
just north of Jokneam city.
12 The border extended east from Sarid to the area near Kisloth-Tabor city and
on to Daberath town and on to Japhia town.
13 From there it extended east to Gath-Hepher city and Eth-Kazin town, and north
to Rimmon city. From there the border extended west to Neah town.
14 From Neah it extended south to Hannathon city and from there to Iphtah-El

22 The border of the area that was allotted to the tribe of Issachar was close to Tabor,
Shahazumah, and Beth-Shemesh cities, and ended in the east at the Jordan River.
Altogether there were 16 cities and the surrounding villages.
23 Those cities and villages were in the land allotted to the clans of the tribe of Issachar.
Land for the tribe of Asher
24 The fifth/next tribe that was allotted land was the tribe of Asher. Each of the clans
in that tribe was allotted some of the land.
25 Their land included the towns of Helkath, Hali, Beten, Acshaph,
26 Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal.
The western border started at Carmel

JOSHUA 19:50
27 From there it extended southeast to Beth-Dagon town, and then to the area
that was allotted to the tribe of Zebulun and Iphtah-El Valley. From there the border
extended east and then north to Beth-Emek town and Neiel and Cabul towns.
28 From there it extended west to Abdon, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah cities, and
continued to Sidon, which is a big city.
29 From there the border extended south toward Ramah and to the big city of
Tyre that had strong walls around it. From there the border extended west to Hosah
town and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. Within their area were the towns of Aczib,
30 Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob.
Altogether there were 22 towns and their
surrounding villages.
31 Those cities and villages were within the land that was allotted to the clans of the
tribe of Asher.
Land for the tribe of Naphtali
32 The sixth/next tribe that was allotted land was the tribe of Naphtali.
Each of the
clans in that tribe was allotted some of the land.
33 The border of their land started in the west at the huge oak tree at Zaanannim,
near Heleph town. It extended east through Adami-Nekeb city and Jabneel, and
then to Lakkum, and ended at the Jordan River.
34 The western boundary extended through Aznoth-Tabor as far as Hukkok city.
It extended to the borders of the tribe of Zebulun at the south, to the border of the
tribe of Asher on the west, and the Jordan River at the east.
Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Kinnereth,
37 Kedesh, Edrei, En-Hazor,
38 Iron, Migdal-El, Horem, Beth-Anath, and Beth-Shemesh. Altogether there were
19 cities and the surrounding villages.
39 Those cities and surrounding villages were in the land that was allotted to the clans
of the tribe of Naphtali.
Land for the tribe of Dan
40 The seventh/last tribe that was allotted land was the tribe of Dan. Each of the clans
in that tribe was allotted some of the land.
41 Their land included the towns of Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir-Shemesh,
42 Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah,

44 Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath,
45 Jehud, Bene-Berak, Gath-Rimmon,
46 Me-Jarkon, Rakkon, and the area near Joppa.
47 But the people of the tribe of Dan were unable to take control of the land that
had been allotted to them. So they went northeast and fought against the people in
Leshem city. They defeated and killed all the people who lived there. Then they
began to live in Leshem, and changed the name of the city to Dan, the man from
whom their tribe descended.
48 All of those towns and surrounding villages were in the land that was allotted to
the clans in the tribe of Dan.
Land for Joshua
49 After the Israeli leaders divided the land among the tribes, they allotted some
land to Joshua.
50 They allotted to him Timnath-Serah.
Yahweh had said that he could have
whatever city he wanted, and that was the city that he chose. It was in the hilly
JOSHUA 19:51
338
JOSHUA 21:1-2
region which was allotted to the tribe of Ephraim. Joshua rebuilt the city and lived
there.
51 Those were the areas that were allotted to the various tribes of Israel. Eleazar
the Supreme Priest and Joshua and the leaders of each tribe divided up the land
while they were all at Shiloh, by ◄casting lots/throwing marked stones► to decide
which area each tribe would receive. They did that while Yahweh was watching, at
the entrance of the Sacred Tent. In that way they completed dividing up the land.

Cities of refuge

must stop there and tell the leaders of the city what happened. If they believe him,
they must allow him to enter the city, and they must give him a place to live among
them.
5 If some relative of the one who was killed comes to that city to get revenge,
the leaders of that city must not allow the relative to take the killer, because what
happened was accidental. He did not hate that person and as a result deliberately
kill him.
6 But the person who killed someone must stay in that city until the city judges put
him on trial. Only if the judges decide that the person who has run/escaped to their city
did not deliberately kill the other person will they allow him to stay in that city, and
own town, because the death of the Supreme Priest will be considered to atone/pay for
7 So the Israelis chose these cities to be cities to which people could run to be safe/
lived; Shechem in the hilly area where the tribe of Ephraim lived; Kiriath-Arba (which
is now named Hebron) in the hilly area where the tribe of Judah lived;
where the tribe of Reuben lived; Ramoth in the Gilead region in the land where the
tribe of Gad lived; and Golan in the Bashan region where the tribe of Manasseh lived.
9 Any Israeli or any foreigner who lived among us, anyone who killed someone
◄accidentally/without planning to do it►, was allowed to run to one of those cities,
and be safe/protected from some relative of the person who died coming there and
killing him to get revenge. He could stay in that city until there was a trial there to
decide whether he was telling the truth or not when he said that he did not plan to kill
that person.
21
Towns for the Levites
1-2 While Eleazar the Supreme Priest and Joshua and the leaders of all the Israeli
tribes were at Shiloh, the leaders of the clans of the tribe of Levi went to them and
said, “Yahweh commanded Moses that you should give us towns where we can have
pasture/fields/grassland for our animals, but you have not done these things yet.”
JOSHUA 21:3
339
They agreed to give
towns and pasturelands to the tribe of Levi.
4 First they allotted some cities to the Kohath clans, who belonged to the tribe of
Levi. To those who were descendants of the first Supreme Priest Aaron, they allotted
13 towns in the areas that had been allotted to the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and
Benjamin.
5 To the other members of the Kohath clan they allotted ten cities in the areas that
had been allotted to the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and the part of the tribe of Manasseh
that lives on the west side of the Jordan River.
6 The people from the Gershon clans were allotted 13 cities in the areas that had
been allotted to the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and the part of the tribe of
Manasseh that lives on the east side of the Jordan River.
7 The people from the Merari clans were allotted twelve cities in the areas that had
been allotted to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun.
8 So the Israeli leaders gave cities and pastureland to the tribe of Levi, just as
Yahweh had commanded Moses that they should do.
9 These are the names of the cities and surrounding pasturelands that were allotted
to them, that were in the areas where the tribes of Judah and Simeon lived.
10 First, they allotted cities to the members of the Kohath clans.
11 They allotted to them Kiriath-Arba (which is now named Hebron), in the hilly
area of Judah. Arba received its name because Arba was the ancestor of the giants
of the Anak people-group.
13 They allotted to them Hebron, which was one of the cities to which people
cities of Libnah,
14 Jattir, Eshtemoa,
15 Holon, Debir,
16 Ain, Juttah, and Beth-Shemesh. Altogether they were allotted those nine cities
which were located in the areas that had been allotted to the tribes of Judah and
Simeon.
17 The Kohath clan was also allotted these four cities: Gibeon, Geba,
18 Anathoth, and Almon. Those cities were in the area that had been allotted to
the tribe of Benjamin.
19 Altogether those 13 towns and surrounding pastureland were allotted to the priests
who were descended from Aaron.
20 The other members the Kohath clan were allotted four cities and the surrounding
pastureland in the area that had been allotted to the tribe of Ephraim.
21 Those cities were Shechem (which was one of the cities to which people could
run/escape to be safe/protected), Gezer,
22 Kibzaim, and Beth-Horon.
23 They were also allotted four cities and surrounding pastureland in the area
that had been allotted to the tribe of Dan. Those cities were Eltekeh, Gibbethon,
24 Aijalon, and Gath-Rimmon.
25 They were also allotted two towns and surrounding pastureland that had been
allotted to the part of the tribe of Manasseh that lived on the west side of the Jordan
River. Those cities were Taanach and Gath-Rimmon.
26 Those were the ten cities and surrounding pastureland that were allotted to the
other members of the Kohath clan.
27 They also allotted towns and the surrounding pastureland to the Gershon clans.
Those clans were also descended from Levi.
JOSHUA 21:28
340
JOSHUA 22:4
They were allotted two cities from the area that had been allotted to the tribe of
Manasseh that is on the east side of the Jordan River. Those cities were Golan in the
Bashan region, which was one of the cities to which people could run/escape to be
safe/protected, and Be-Eshtarah.
28 From the area that had been allotted to the tribe of Issachar they were allotted
four cities. Those cities were Kishion, Daberath,
29 Jarmuth, and En-Gannim.
30 From the area that had been allotted to the tribe of Asher they were allotted
four cities. Those cities were Mishal, Abdon,
31 Helkath, and Rehob.
32 From the area that had been allotted to the tribe of Naphtali they were allotted
three cities. Those cities were Kedesh in the Galilee region (it was one of the cities
to which people could run/escape to be safe/protected), Hammoth-Dor, and Kartan.
33 So altogether the Gershon clans were allotted 13 cities and the surrounding
pasturelands.
34 The other descendants of Levi, the ones who belonged to the Merari clans, were
also allotted towns and their surrounding pasturelands.
From the area that had been allotted to the tribe of Zebulun they were allotted four
35 Dimnah, and Nahalal.
four cities. They were Bezer, Jahaz,
38 From the area that had been allotted to the tribe of Gad they were allotted four
cities. They were Ramoth, which was one of the cities in the Gilead region to which
people could run/escape to be safe/protected, Mahanaim,
39 Heshbon, and Jazer.
40 Altogether twelve cities were allotted to the Merari clans.
41 So altogether 48 cities were allotted to the tribe of Levi,
42 and each city had surrounding pastureland.
43 In that way Yahweh allotted to the Israeli people all the land that he had promised
to give to their/our ancestors. The Israeli people took control of most of those areas
and started to live there.
44 Just like he had promised our ancestors, Yahweh allowed them/us to have peace
with the enemies that surrounded them/us. Yahweh enabled the Israelis/us to defeat
their/our enemies.
45 Yahweh did all the things that he had promised to the Israeli people/ us.
Everything that he said would happen did happen.

The tribes east of the Jordan went home

tribe of Manasseh.

obeyed everything that Yahweh your God commanded you to do.
4 He promised to give peace to us Israelis, and he has done what he promised. So
now you may go back to your homes, to the land that Moses gave to you, on the east
side of the Jordan River.
JOSHUA 22:5
341
JOSHUA 22:23
5 Moses also commanded you to love Yahweh your God and to obey his commands,
and to continue to worship him and serve him by everything that you think and
everything that you do.”
6 Then Joshua blessed them and said goodbye to them, and they prepared to leave
and return to their homes on the east side of the Jordan River.
7 Moses had given the Bashan region to half the tribe of Manasseh, and land on the
west side of the Jordan River to the other half of the tribe. Before they left, he asked
God to bless them.
8 He said, “Go back to your homes and to all the things that you have taken from
your enemies—the many animals and silver and gold and things made of bronze and
iron, and many beautiful clothes. But you should share some of those things with
other people of your tribe.”
9 So the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh left the
other Israelis at Shiloh in Canaan land, to return to their homes in the Gilead region.
That was the area that belonged to them. It had been allotted to them by Moses as
Yahweh had commanded.
10 The people from those three tribes arrived near the western side of the Jordan
River, at a town called Geliloth. There they built a large altar. Then they crossed the
Jordan River to the Gilead region.
11 But the other Israelis who were still at Shiloh heard about the altar that those
men had built.
12 They became very angry with the men of those tribes, so they decided to fight
them.
13 The Israelis sent Phinehas, who was the son of Eleazar the Supreme Priest, to
talk with the people of those three tribes.
14 They also sent one leader from each of the ten tribes that were still at Shiloh.
Each of them was a leader of his clan.
15 Those leaders went to the Gilead region to talk to the people of the tribes of
Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh. They said,
we Israelis worship by building an altar for yourselves?
17 Have you forgotten what happened at Peor, when some Israelis sinned by
worshiping the god that the Moab people-group worship? Many Israelis became very
sick and died because of that sin, and we are still suffering because of their sin.
18 Are you now turning away from obeying Yahweh and refusing to do what he
wants? If you do not stop rebelling against Yahweh today, he will be angry with all
of us Israelis tomorrow.’
19 “If you think that Yahweh considers that your land here is not suitable for
worshiping him, come back to our land where Yahweh’s Sacred Tent is. We can
share our land with you. But do not rebel against Yahweh and against us by building
another altar for Yahweh our God.
20 Do you remember what happened when Zerah’s son Achan refused to obey
Yahweh’s command to destroy everything in Jericho? That one man disobeyed God’s
command, but many [HYP] other Israelis were punished. Achan died because of his
sin, but other Israelis also died.”
21 The leaders of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh replied,
22 “Yahweh, the Almighty God, knows why we did that, and we want you to know,
too. If we have done something wrong against Yahweh, you may kill us.
23 If we have disobeyed one of Yahweh’s laws, we request that he should punish us.
We did not build that new altar to completely burn animals as sacrifices to Yahweh,
or to offer on it sacrifices of grain or sacrifices to maintain fellowship with God.
JOSHUA 22:24
342
JOSHUA 23:5
24 “This is the reason that we built that altar:
We were afraid/worried that some
afraid that then they would say, ‘You are not allowed to worship Yahweh, the God
25 Yahweh caused the Jordan River to be a boundary between us and you people
were worried that your descendants would force our descendants to stop worshiping
26 “That is the reason that we decided to build that new altar. But it is not an altar
for completely burning sacrifices of animals and burning other sacrifices.
27 We built that new altar to prove/ show to you and to us and to all of our
descendants that we worship Yahweh by completely burning animal sacrifices and
offerings of grain and offerings to maintain fellowship with Yahweh only at the place
Yahweh chooses. We do not want your descendants to say to our descendants, ‘You
do not belong to Yahweh.’
28 “In the future, if your descendants say that, our descendants can say, ‘Look at
the altar that our ancestors made! It is exactly like Yahweh’s altar that our ancestors
built, but we do not burn sacrifices on it. It only shows that we are Israelis!’
29 We certainly do not want to rebel against Yahweh or stop doing what he
desires, by building an altar for completely burning some sacrifices and burning
grain offerings and making other sacrifices. We know that there is only one true altar
for Yahweh our God, and it is in front of the Sacred Tent at Shiloh.”
30 When Phinehas the priest and the other ten leaders heard what they said, they
were pleased.
31 So Phinehas said to them, “Now we know that Yahweh is with all of us Israelis,
and that you were not rebelling against him when you built that altar. And we know
that Yahweh will not punish us Israelis because of your having done that.”
32 Then Phinehas and the Israeli leaders left the people of the tribes of Reuben and
Gad in the Gilead region, and returned to Canaan. There they told the other Israelis
what had happened.
33 They were pleased, and they thanked God. And they did not talk any more about
fighting against the people of the tribes of Reuben and Gad and destroying everything
in their land.
34 The people of the tribes of Reuben and Gad named their new altar ‘A reminder
to us all that Yahweh is God’.
23
Joshua’s final speech
1 Yahweh enabled the Israelis to live peacefully for many years with the people-
groups that were around them.
2 Joshua was now very old. One day he summoned the leaders of the tribes of Israel,
the leaders of the clans, the judges, and other officials. He said to them, “I am now
very old.
3 You people have seen what Yahweh our God has done to help you defeat the
people-groups that lived in this land. Yahweh our God has fought for you.
4 But do not forget that he has given to you all this land, from the Jordan River in
the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, all this land that I have allotted to you.
5 Yahweh our God will compel the people who are still living there to leave. He will
push them out as you advance. Then the land will be yours, as Yahweh has promised
you.
JOSHUA 23:6
343
disobey any part of it [IDM].
7 Do not associate with the people who live among us who are not Israelis and who
worship other gods. Do not mention the names of their gods, and do not use the
names of their gods when you promise to do something. Do not serve their gods or
worship them.
8 You must continue to do what Yahweh our God wants us to do, as you have been
doing.
9 “Yahweh has forced many very powerful people-groups to leave as you advanced.
No people-group has been able to defeat you.
10 Each of you will be able to cause 1,000 of them to run away, because Yahweh
your God will fight for you, just like he promised to do.
11 So be sure that you continue to love Yahweh our God.
12 “If you turn away from doing what Yahweh desires and you associate with the
people who are not Israelis, and if you marry them,
13 then you can be sure that Yahweh our God will not help you to expel those peoplegroups from your land. They will be like traps [DOU, MET] that will catch you. They
will be like whips that strike your backs, and like thorns that will scratch your eyes.
As a result, none of you will be left in this good land that Yahweh our God is giving
to you.
14 “It is almost time for me to die, like everyone does [EUP]. You know in your hearts
[DOU] that Yahweh has done for you [LIT] everything that he promised to do.
15 He has given to you all the good things that he promised. In the same way, the
other things that he promised, things that are not good, will also happen. He said that
if you do what is evil, he will get rid of you and send you away from this good land
that he has given to you.
16 That will happen if you do not obey the commands that Yahweh our God told
you to obey. If you serve other gods and worship them, Yahweh will become very
angry with you. Very quickly he will expel you from this good land that he has given
to you, and none of you will be left here.”
24
Joshua encouraged the Israeli people to worship only Yahweh
1 Many years later, Joshua summoned representatives of all the tribes of Israel.
He gathered together the elders, the leaders, the judges, and the other officials at
Shechem city. He told them to listen to what God wanted to tell them.
2 Joshua said to all of them, “This is what Yahweh, the God we Israeli people
worship, is saying: ‘Long ago, your ancestors, including Abraham’s father Terah and
Abraham’s younger brother Nahor, lived on the east side of the Euphrates River.
3 But I took your ancestor Abraham from that land east of the Euphrates River, and
I led him as he lived in various places in this land of Canaan, and I enabled him to
have many descendants. First, I enabled him to have a son, Isaac.
4 When Isaac grew up, I enabled him to have twin sons, Jacob and Esau. I enabled
Esau to live in the hilly area in Seir region, but many years later Jacob and his sons
and their families went down to live in Egypt.
5 “Many years later, I sent Moses and his older brother Aaron to help your people,
and I caused the people of Egypt to suffer very much because of what I did there.
Then I enabled your ancestors to leave Egypt.
JOSHUA 24:6
344
JOSHUA 24:18
6 When I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, they came to the Red Sea.
The
Egyptian army pursued them, some riding in chariots and others on horses, and they
also arrived at the Red Sea.
7 Then your ancestors pleaded with me to help them. So he caused ◄darkness/a
very dark cloud► to come between your ancestors and the Egyptian army, so that the
Egyptian army could not see your ancestors. I separated the water in the Red Sea so
that your ancestors could cross it, but when the Egyptian army tried to cross in the
same way to pursue them, I caused the water to come back and cover them, and the
Egyptian soldiers all drowned, as your ancestors watched and were amazed [IDM].
But after that, you lived in the desert for many years.
8 “Then I brought your ancestors to the area where the groups who were
descendants of Amor lived, east of the Jordan River. They fought against you, but
I enabled you to defeat them [IDM]. I enabled you to destroy them so that you could
live in their land [IDM].
9 Then, Zippor’s son Balak, the King of Moab, ◄decided that his army would fight
against/opposed► the Israelis. He summoned Beor’s son Balaam and asked him to
curse you.
10 But I would not do what Balaam asked, so he ◄blessed/said that I would do great
things for► you four times, and I did not enable the army of Moab to defeat you
[IDM].
Jericho prepared to fight against you, and the armies of the descendants of Amor,
Periz, Canaan, Heth, Girgash, Hiv, and Jebus all prepared to do the same thing but I
12 I am the one who caused them to panic as you advanced and enabled you to
were descendants of Amor. You did not defeat them by using your own bows and
arrows and swords; it was I who defeated them.
13 So I gave you a land that you had not tilled/planted, and I gave you cities that you
did not build. Now you live in those cities and you eat the grapes from the grapevines
that you did not plant, and you eat olives from trees that you did not plant.’ ”
14 Then Joshua said to the people, “Because of all that Yahweh has done for you,
revere him, and serve/worship him very faithfully. Throw away the idols that your
ancestors worshiped on the east/other side of the Euphrates River and in Egypt. Serve
only Yahweh.
15 But if you do not want to serve/worship Yahweh, you should decide today what
gods you will serve/worship. You should decide whether you will serve/worship the
gods that your ancestors who lived on the other/east side of the Euphrates River
served, or whether you will serve/worship the gods that the descendants of Amor,
who previously lived in the land where you are now living, serve/worship. But as for
me and my family [MTY], we will serve/worship Yahweh!”
16 The Israeli people answered, “We will never quit serving/worshiping Yahweh! We
would never think of [IDM] serving/worshiping other gods!
17 It was our God, Yahweh, who brought our parents and grandparents up out of
Egypt. He rescued them from that land where they were slaves. As he rescued them,
they saw him perform great miracles. He protected them all the time when they were
traveling. He protected them from all the people-groups through whose territory they
traveled.
18 As our forefathers advanced, Yahweh expelled the descendants of Amor and the
other people-groups who lived in this land. Yahweh is our God, so we are saying that
we also will serve/worship him.”
JOSHUA 24:19
345
JOSHUA 24:33
19 Joshua replied to the people, “I think that you are not able to serve/worship
Yahweh, because he is a holy God. He will not forgive your sinning and rebelling
against him. He demands that you serve/worship only him [IDM].
20 He has been good to you in the past, but if you turn away from him and
serve/worship foreign/other gods, he will turn against you and he will cause you
to experience disasters. He will punish [IDM] you severely!”
21 But the people replied to Joshua, “No, we will not turn away from worshiping/
serving Yahweh We will serve/worship Yahweh!”
22 Then Joshua said, “You yourselves are saying that you have decided to serve/
worship Yahweh.” They replied, “Yes, we are saying that.”
23 Then Joshua said, “Since you have decided that, you must throw away all the
other gods/idols that you have among you. You must also promise that you will
wholeheartedly give yourselves to Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis serve/worship.”
24 The people replied, “We will serve/worship Yahweh, our God, and obey him.”
25 That day, Joshua established an agreement between the people and Yahweh. He
wrote for them all the laws that they were required to obey.
26 He wrote all those laws on a scroll. He called it ‘The laws of God’. Then he told
some men to set up a large stone there at Shechem, under the large oak tree near the
place where they worshiped Yahweh.
27 He said to all the people, “Look! It is as though this stone has heard everything
that Yahweh said to you and that you promised Yahweh. It will serve as a witness
against you if you rebel against your God!”
28 Then Joshua sent the people away, and all of them returned to their own areas/
homes.
Joshua died
29 Some time after that, Nun’s son Joshua, the faithful servant of Yahweh, died. He
was 110 years old when he died.
30 The Israeli people buried his body on his own property in Timnath-Serah town
town. It is north of Gaash Mountain in the hilly area of the tribe who were
descendants of Ephraim.
31 The Israeli people served/worshiped Yahweh as long as Joshua was alive. After
Joshua died, they continued serving/worshiping Yahweh while the elders who had
experienced everything that Yahweh had done for the Israeli people were still alive.
32 Joseph’s bones, which the Israeli people had brought with them from Egypt, were
also buried at Shechem. The people buried them in the piece of land that Jacob had
bought long ago for 100 pieces of silver from Hamor, the father of Shechem. That
piece of land was in the area that was given to the people who were descendants of
Ephraim and Manasseh, Joseph’s sons.
33 Eleazar, the Supreme Priest, the son of Aaron, also died. They buried his body at
Gibeah, in the area that had been given to Eleazar’s son Phinehas, in the hilly area
that belonged to the people who were descendants of Ephraim.
JUDGES 1:1

JUDGES 1:15
This book contains the account of people who delivered
The tribes of Judah and Simeon defeated the Canaanites
1 After Joshua died, the Israeli people asked Yahweh, “Which of our tribes should
attack the Canaan people-group first?”
2 Yahweh replied, “I will enable the tribe of Judah to defeat [IDM] the Canaan
people-group.”
3 The men of Judah went to their fellow Israelis, the men from the tribe of Simeon,
and said to them, “Come and help us to fight the Canaan people-group in order that
we can take from them the land that Yahweh allotted to us. If you do that, we will go
with you and help you conquer the people in the land that Yahweh promised to give to
you.” So the men from the tribe of Simeon went with the men of the tribe of Judah.
4 When the men of those two tribes attacked, Yahweh enabled them to defeat 10,000
men of the Canaan people-group and the Periz people-group [DOU] at Bezek city.
5 During the battle they found Adoni-Bezek, the leader of the city,
6 but he tried to run away. The Israelis pursued him and caught him. Then they
cut off his thumbs and his big toes.
7 Adoni-Bezek said, “My army captured 70 kings. We cut off their thumbs and big
toes. After that, we forced those kings to eat scraps that fell from our table. Now
God has ◄paid me back for/done to me like► what we did to them.” Then the men of
Judah took Adoni-Bezek to Jerusalem, and he died there.
8 The army of Judah fought against the men of Jerusalem, and they captured the
city. With their swords they killed the people who lived there and they burned the
houses in the city.
9 Later, the men of Judah went down to fight the Canaan people-group who lived
in the hilly area, in the desert to the south, and in the foothills to the west.
10 The men of Judah also went to fight against the Canaan people-group who lived
in Hebron city, which at that time was named Kiriath-Arba. They defeated the armies
of kings Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
Springs for Caleb’s daughter
11 Then they left that area and went to fight against the people living in Debir city,
which was previously named Kiriath-Sepher.
12 Before they attacked the city, Caleb said to them, “If one of you attacks and
captures Kiriath-Sepher, I will allow him to marry my daughter.”
13 Othniel, who was the son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz, captured the city. So
Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him, to become his wife.
14 When Acsah married Othniel, she told him to ask her father to give him a field.
But she decided to ask him herself. She rode to Caleb’s house on her donkey, and when
she got off the donkey, Caleb could see that something was troubling her. So he asked
her, “What do you want?”
15 She replied, “I want you to do a favor for me. You have given me some land in
the southern desert, but it is very dry there. So please also give me some land that has
springs of water.” So Caleb gave her some land on higher ground that had a spring,
and some land on lower ground that also had a spring.
JUDGES 1:16
16 The people of the Ken people-group who were descendants of Moses’ father-in-
law left Jericho, which was called ‘The City of Palm Trees’. They went with some of
the men of Judah to live with them in the southern desert area, near Arad city.
17 The men of Judah and their fellow Israelis from the tribe of Simeon defeated
the people of the Canaan people-group who lived in Zephath city. They completely
destroyed the city and gave it a new name, Hormah, which means ‘complete
destruction’.
18 The men of Judah also captured Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron cities and all the land
that is near those cities.
19 Yahweh helped the men of Judah to capture the hilly area, but they could not
force the people who were living in the plains to leave, because those people had
better weapons—they had iron chariots.
20 Hebron city was given to Caleb because Moses had promised him that he could
have that city. And Caleb forced the three clans descended from Anak to leave that
area.
21 But the people of the tribe of Benjamin could not force the people of the Jebus
22 The men of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh went to fight against the men of
23 They sent some spies to find out everything that they could find out about Bethel,
which was previously called Luz.
24 The spies saw a man who was coming out of the city. They said to him, “If you
show us a way to get into the city, we will be kind to you and we will not kill you.”
25 So the man showed them a way to enter the city. The men of the tribes of Ephraim
and Manasseh entered the city and killed all the people with their swords, but they
did not kill the man who showed them how to get into the city, and they did not kill
his family.
26 That man went to the area where the descendants of Heth lived, and built a city.
He named the city Luz, and that is still the name of that city.
27 There were people of the Canaan people-group who lived in Beth-Shan, Taanach,
Dor, Ibleam, and Megiddo cities and in the surrounding villages. The men of the tribe
of Manasseh did not force those people to leave those towns, because the people of
the Canaan people-group were determined to stay there.
28 Later, the Israelis became ◄stronger/ more numerous►, and they forced the
people of the Canaan people-group to work for them as their slaves, but they did
not force all the people of the Canaan people-group to leave their land.
29 The men of the tribe of Ephraim did not force the people of the Canaan peoplegroup to leave Gezer city. So the people of the Canaan people-group continued to live
with the people of the tribe of Ephraim.
30 The men of the tribe of Zebulun did nor compel the people of the Canaan peoplegroup who were living in Kitron and Nahalol cities to leave. They stayed there and
lived among the people of the tribe of Zebulun, but the people of Zebulun forced them
to work for them as their slaves.
31 The men of the tribe of Asher did not force the people of the Canaan people-group
who lived in Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Aczib, Helbah, Aphek and Rehob cities to leave.
32 So the people of the tribe of Asher lived among them.
33 The men of the tribe of Naphtali did not compel the people who lived in BethShemesh and Beth-Anath cities to leave, so the people in those two cities continued

36 The land where the Amor people-group lived extended from Scorpion Pass toward
the west beyond Sela town, up into the hilly area.

Yahweh’s message to Israel
1 Yahweh appeared in the form of an angel and
went up from Gilgal to a place that
was later called Bokim. He said to the Israeli people, “I brought your ancestors up
here from Egypt. I led them into this land that I solemnly promised to give to your
ancestors. I said to them, ‘The agreement that I made with you, as for me, I will never
◄break it/say that it is ended►.
2 But as for you, you must never make a peace agreement with the people who live
in this land. You must tear down the altars where they make sacrifices to idols.’ But
you have not obeyed me.
3 So now, I am telling you that I will not expel your enemies as you advance. They
will be like thorns in your sides. And they will try to trap you by making you worship
their idols.”
4 After he told that to all the Israelis, the people cried loudly.
5 They called that place Bokim, which means ‘weeping’. There they offered sacrifices
to Yahweh.
Joshua died
6 After Joshua sent the Israeli people away, each group went to possess the land
that had been allotted to them.
7 They served Yahweh as long as Joshua was alive, and as long as the elders, those
who had seen all the great things that Yahweh had done for Israel, were alive.
8 Then Yahweh’s servant Joshua died. He was 110 years old when he died.
9 They buried his body in the area he had received from Moses, at Timnath-Serah,
in the area where the descendants of Ephraim lived, north of Gaash Mountain.
The Israelis were punished for doing evil things
10 After all the people died who lived at the same time as Joshua [EUP], a group of
people grew up who did not know Yahweh, and did not know what great things he
had done for the Israeli people.
11-13 They did things that Yahweh said were very evil. They worshiped idols that
represented the god Baal and the goddess Astarte. They worshiped [DOU] the various
gods that the people-groups around them worshiped. They stopped worshiping
Yahweh, the God their ancestors worshiped, the one who had brought their ancestors
out of Egypt. That caused Yahweh to be very angry.
14 So he allowed people from other groups to raid them and steal their crops and
animals. They were no longer able to resist their enemies, and Yahweh allowed all
their enemies around them to defeat them.
15 Whenever the Israelis went to fight their enemies, Yahweh [MTY] was opposing
them, and allowed their enemies to defeat them, just as he had promised he would
do. So the Israelis were greatly distressed.
JUDGES 3:9
16 Then Yahweh gave leaders to them. These leaders rescued the Israelis from the
people who were raiding them.
17 But the Israelis still would not pay attention to their leaders. Instead, they went
to the idols, acting like prostitutes who gave themselves to men who were not their
husbands [MET], and they worshiped those idols. They were not like their ancestors.
Their ancestors obeyed what Yahweh commanded, but their descendants quickly
stopped behaving as their ancestors had behaved.
18 Whenever Yahweh gave a leader to them, he helped that leader and enabled
him to rescue the people from their enemies. He helped them like that as long as
that leader was alive. Yahweh pitied them as they groaned because they were being
oppressed and caused to suffer.
19 But after that leader died, the people went back to behaving in ways even more
evil than their ancestors had behaved. They worshiped other gods and bowed down
to them and did all [LIT] the things that they thought those gods wanted them to do.
20 So Yahweh was very angry with the Israeli people. He said, “These people have
disobeyed the agreement I made with their ancestors. They have not done what I
told them to do.
21 So I will no longer expel the people-groups that Joshua left in this land when he
died.
22 I will use them to test the Israeli people to see whether they will do what I want
them to do, as their ancestors did.”
23 Yahweh had allowed those people-groups to stay in that land. He did not expel
them by allowing Joshua and his men to defeat them.
3
1-2 At that time there were still many people-groups in Canaan.
Yahweh left them
there to test the Israeli people. But many of the Israelis in Canaan were ones who
had not fought in any of the wars in Canaan. So Yahweh also left those people-groups
in Canaan so that the descendants of those who had not fought in any of the wars
might learn how to fight.
3 This is a list of the people-groups that Yahweh left there: The Philistines and their
five leaders, the people living in the area near Sidon city, the descendants of Canaan,
and the descendants of Hiv who were living in the mountains of Lebanon between
Baal-Hermon Mountain and Lebo-Hamath.
4 Yahweh left these people-groups there to test the Israelis, to see if they would obey
his commands which he had told Moses to give them.
5 The Israelis lived among the Canaan people-group, the Hiv people-group, the Amor
people-group, the Periz people-group, the Hiv people-group, and the Jebus peoplegroup.
6 Moses had told the people not to associate with any of those people. But the Israelis
took daughters of people from those people-groups to be their own wives, and gave
their own daughters to men of those groups, to marry them. And as a result they
started to worship the gods of those people-groups.
goddess Asherah.
8 Yahweh became very angry with the Israelis. So he allowed king Cushan from
Mesopotamia to conquer them and rule them for eight years.
9 But when they pleaded to Yahweh to help them, he gave them a leader to rescue
them. He was Othniel, the son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz.
JUDGES 3:10
350
JUDGES 3:29
10 Yahweh’s Spirit came upon him, and he became their leader. He led an army that
fought against the army of Cushan, and defeated them.
11 After that, there was peace in the land for 40 years, until Othniel died.
Ehud became their next leader
12 After that, the Israelis again did things that Yahweh said were very evil.
As a
result, he allowed the army of King Eglon, who ruled the Moab area, to defeat the
Israelis.
13 Eglon persuaded the leaders of the Ammon and Amalek people-groups to join
their armies with his army to attack Israel. They captured Jericho, which was called
‘The City of Palm Trees’.
14 Then King Eglon ruled the Israelis for eighteen years.
15 But then the Israelis again pleaded to Yahweh to help them. So he gave them
another leader to rescue them. He was Ehud, a left-handed man, the son of Gera,
from the descendants of Benjamin. The Israelis sent him to King Eglon to give him
their yearly protection money.
16 Ehud had with him a double-edged dagger, about a foot and a half long. He
strapped it to his right thigh, under his clothes.
17 He gave the money to King Eglon, who was a very fat man.
18 Then Ehud started to go back home with the men who had carried the money.
19 When they arrived at the stone carvings near Gilgal, he told the other men to go
on, but he himself turned around and went back to the king of Moab. When he arrived
at the palace, he said to the king, “Your majesty, I have a secret message for you.” So
the king told all his servants to be quiet, and sent them out of the room.
20 Then, as Eglon was sitting alone in the upstairs room of his summer palace, Ehud
came close to him and said, “I have a message for you from God.” As the king got up
from his chair,
21 Ehud reached with his left hand and pulled the dagger from his right thigh, and
plunged it into the king’s belly.
22 He thrust it in so far that the handle went into the king’s belly, and the blade
came out the king’s back. Ehud did not pull the dagger out. He left it there, with the
handle buried in the king’s fat.
23 Then Ehud left the room. He went out to the porch. He shut the doors to the
room and locked them.
24 After he had gone, King Eglon’s servants came back, but they saw that the doors
25 So they waited, but when the king did not open the doors of the room, after a
their king was lying on the floor, dead.
26 Meanwhile, Ehud escaped. He passed by the stone carvings and arrived at Seirah,
in the hilly area where the descendants of Ephraim lived.
27 There he blew a trumpet to signal that the people should join him to fight the
people of Moab. So the Israelis went with him from the hills. They went down toward
the Jordan river, with Ehud leading them.
28 He said to the men, “Yahweh is going to allow us to defeat your enemies, the
people of Moab. So follow me!” So they followed him down to the river, and they
stationed some of their men at the place where people can walk across the river, in
order that they could kill any people from Moab who tried to cross the river to escape.
29 At that time, the Israelis killed about 10,000 people from Moab. They were all
strong and capable men, but not one of them escaped.
JUDGES 3:30
351
JUDGES 4:15
30 On that day, the Israelis conquered the people of Moab. Then there was peace in
their land for 80 years.
Shamgar became their next leader
31 After Ehud died, Shamgar became their leader. He rescued the Israelis from the
Philistines. In one battle he killed 600 Philistines with an ◄ox goad/sharp wooden
pole►.
4
Deborah became the next leader
1 After Ehud died, the Israelis again started doing things Yahweh said were very
evil.
2 So he allowed the army of Jabin, one of the kings of Canaan land, who ruled in
Hazor city, to conquer the Israelis. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived
3 Sisera’s army had 900 chariots. For 20 years he oppressed the Israelis. Then they
pleaded to Yahweh to help them.
4 At that time Deborah, who was the wife of Lappidoth, was a prophetess who had
become the leader in Israel.
5 She would sit under her palm tree at a place between Ramah and Bethel, in the
hilly area where the descendants of Ephraim lived, and people would come to her
and ask her to settle disputes between them.
6 One day she summoned Barak, the son of Abinoam, when he was in Kedesh,
in the area where the descendants of Naphtali lived. She said to him, “This is what
Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship, is commanding you to do: ‘Take with you
1,000 men, some from the descendants of Naphtali and some from the descendants
of Zebulun, and lead them to Tabor Mountain.
7 Yahweh will lure Sisera, the commander of King Jabin’s army, to come with his
chariots and his army, to the Kishon River, a few miles away. I will enable your men
8 Barak replied, “I will go only if you go with me.”
to do, Yahweh will enable a woman to defeat Sisera, and the result will be that ◄you
10 So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh. There he summoned men from Zebulun
and Naphtali. Ten thousand men came to him, and then they went together with
Deborah to Tabor Mountain.
11 At that time Heber, one of the descendants of the Ken people-group, had moved
with his wife Jael from the area where that group lived, and set up his tent near the
big oak tree at Zaanannim, near Kedesh. Heber was a descendant of Moses’ brotherin-law Hobab.
12 Someone told Sisera that Barak had gone up on Tabor Mountain with an army.
13 So he gathered his troops with their 900 chariots, and they marched from
Harosheth-Haggoyim to the Kishon River.
14 Then Deborah said to Barak, “Get ready! This is the day that Yahweh will enable
your army to defeat the army of Sisera. Yahweh is going ahead of you!” So Barak led
his men as they descended from Tabor Mountain.
15 As they advanced, Yahweh caused Sisera and all his chariots and his army to
have great difficulty maneuvering/moving around. So Sisera jumped down from his
chariot and ran away.
JUDGES 4:16
352
JUDGES 5:8
16 But Barak and his men pursued the other chariots and the enemy soldiers as far
as Harosheth-Haggoyim. They killed all of the men in Sisera’s army. Not one man
survived.
17 But Sisera ran to Jael’s tent. He did that because his boss, King Jabin of Hazor
city, was a good friend of Jael’s husband Heber.
18 Jael went out to greet Sisera. She said to him, “Sir, come into my tent! Do not be
afraid!” So he went into the tent and lay down, and she covered him with a blanket.
19 He said to her, “I’m thirsty; can you give me some water?” So she opened a
leather container of milk, and gave him a drink. Then she covered him with the
blanket again.
20 He said to her, “Stand in the entrance of the tent. If someone comes and asks ‘Is
anyone else here?’, say ‘No.’ ”
21 Sisera was very exhausted, so he soon was asleep. While he was sleeping, Jael
crept quietly to him, holding a hammer and a tent peg. She pounded the peg into his
skull, and all the way through his head into the ground, and he died.
22 When Barak passed by Jael’s tent to look for Sisera, she went out to greet him. She
said, “Come in, and I will show you the man you are searching for!” So he followed
her into the tent, and he saw Sisera lying there, dead, with the tent peg through his
head.
23 On that day God enabled the Israelis to defeat the army of Jabin, the king of the
people of Canaan.
24 From that time, the Israeli people continued to become stronger, and the army of
King Jabin continued to become weaker. Finally the Israelis were able to completely
subdue the people ruled by the king of Canaan.
5
it is time to praise Yahweh!
3 Listen, you kings! Pay attention, you leaders!
I will sing to Yahweh. With this song I will praise Yahweh, the God we Israelis
worship.
4 O Yahweh, when you came from Seir, when you marched from that land better
known as Edom,
the earth shook,
and rain poured down from the skies.
5 The mountains shook when you came,
just like Sinai Mountain shook when you appeared there,
because you are Yahweh,
the God whom we Israelis worship.
6 “When Shamgar was our leader and when Jael ruled us,
we were afraid to walk on the main roads;
instead, caravans of travelers walked on winding less traveled roads
to avoid being molested.
7 People left their small villages, and moved into the walled cities
until I, Deborah, became their leader.
I became like a mother to the Israeli people.
8 When the Israeli people abandoned Yahweh and chose new gods,
JUDGES 5:9
353
JUDGES 5:19
enemies attacked the gates of the cities,
and then they took away the shields and spears from 40,000 Israeli soldiers.
Not one shield or spear was left.
9 I am thankful for the leaders and soldiers who volunteered to fight.
Praise Yahweh for them!
10 “You wealthy people who ride on donkeys,
sitting on nice padded saddles,
and you people who just walk on the road,
you all listen!
11 Listen to the voices of the singers who gather at the places where the animals drink
water.
They tell about how Yahweh acted righteously
when he enabled the Israeli warriors to conquer their enemies.
“Yahweh’s people marched down to the gates of our city.
12 The people came to my house and shouted,
‘Deborah, wake up! Wake up and start singing!’
They also shouted,
‘Barak, son of Abinoam, get up, and capture our enemies!’
These men who belonged to Yahweh came with me
14 Some came from the tribe descended from Ephraim.
They came from land that once belonged to the descendants of Amalek.
And men from the tribe descended from Benjamin followed them.
Troops from the group descended from Makir also came down,
and officers from the tribe descended from Zebulun came down, carrying staffs.
15 Leaders from the tribes descended from Issachar joined Barak and me.
They followed Barak, rushing down into the valley.
But men from the tribe descended from Reuben could not decide whether or not to
join us.
16 Why did you men stay at your sheep pens,
waiting to hear the shepherds whistle for their flocks of sheep to come to the
pens?
Men in the tribe descended from Reuben could not decide
whether they would join us to fight our enemies, or not.
17 Similarly, the men living in the Gilead area stayed at home, east of the Jordan River.
And the men from the tribe descended from Dan,
why did they stay home?
The tribe descended from Asher sat by the seashore.
They stayed in their coves.
18 But men from the tribe descended from Zebulun risked ◄their lives/were ready to
die fighting► on the battlefield,
and men descended from Naphtali were ready to do that, also.
19 “The kings of Canaan fought us at Taanach, near the springs in Megiddo Valley.
But since they did not defeat us,
they did not carry away any silver or other treasures from the battle.
JUDGES 5:20
354
JUDGES 6:4
20 It was as though the stars in the sky fought for us
and as though those stars in their paths fought against Sisera.
21 The Kishon River swept them away—
that river that has been there for ages.
I will tell myself to be brave and continue marching on.
22 The hooves of the horses of Sisera’s army pounded the ground.
Those powerful horses kept galloping along.
23 The angel sent by Yahweh said,
‘Curse the people of Meroz town,
because they did not come to help Yahweh
to defeat the mighty warriors of Canaan.’
24 “But God is very pleased with Jael,
the wife of Heber from the Ken people-group.
25 Sisera asked for some water,
She brought him some yogurt/curds in a bowl that was suitable for kings.
26 Then, when he was asleep, she reached for a tent peg with her left hand,
and she reached for a hammer with her right hand.
She hit Sisera hard with it and crushed his head.
She pounded the tent peg right through his head.
27 He collapsed
and fell dead at her feet.
28 “Sisera’s mother looked out from her window.
She waited for him to return.
She said, ‘Why is he taking so long to come home in his chariot?
Why don’t I hear the sound of the wheels of his chariot?’
29 One wise woman replied to her,
and she kept consoling herself by repeating those words:
30 ‘Perhaps they are dividing up the things and the people they captured after the
battle.
Each soldier will get one or two women.
Sisera will get some beautiful robes,
and some beautiful embroidered robes for me.’
31 But that is not what happened!
Yahweh, I hope that all your enemies will die as
Sisera did!
And I desire that all those who love you will be as strong as the sun when it rises!

Gideon became the next leader
1 Again the Israelis did things that Yahweh said were very evil. So he allowed the
people of Midian to conquer them and rule them for seven years.
2 The people of Midian treated the Israelis so cruelly that the Israelis fled to the
mountains. There they made places to live in caves and animal dens.
3 Whenever the Israelis planted things in their fields, the people of Midian and
Amalek and other groups from the east invaded Israel.
4 They set up tents in the area, and then destroyed the crops as far south as Gaza.
They did not leave anything for the Israelis’ sheep or cattle or donkeys to eat.
JUDGES 6:5
355
JUDGES 6:23
5 They came into Israel with their tents and their livestock like a swarm of locusts.
There were so many of them that arrived riding on their camels that no one could
count them. They stayed and ruined the Israelis’ crops.
6 The people of Midian took almost everything the Israelis owned. So finally the
7 When the Israelis pleaded with Yahweh to help them because of what the people
8 he sent to them a prophet, who said, “Yahweh, the God we Israelis worship, says
this: ‘Your ancestors were slaves in Egypt.
9 But I rescued them from the leaders of Egypt and from all the others who
oppressed them. I expelled their enemies from this land, and gave it to your ancestors.
10 I told you all, “I am Yahweh, your God. You are now in the land where the
descendants of Amor live, but you must not worship the gods whom they worship.”
But you did not pay attention to me.’ ”
11 One day Yahweh appeared in the form of an angel and sat underneath a big oak
tree at Ophrah town. That tree belonged to Joash, who was from the clan of Abiezer.
Joash’s son Gideon was threshing wheat in the pit where they pressed grapes to make
wine. He was threshing the grain there in order to hide it from the people of Midian.
12 Yahweh went over to Gideon and said to him, “You mighty warrior, Yahweh is
helping you!”
13 Gideon replied, “Sir, if Yahweh is helping us, why have all these bad things
happened to us? We heard about [RHQ] all the miracles that Yahweh performed
slaves in Egypt. But now Yahweh has abandoned us, and we are ruled by the people
14 Then Yahweh turned toward him and said, “I will give you strength to enable
you to rescue the Israelis from the people of Midian. I am sending you to do that!”
15 Gideon replied, “But Yahweh, how can I rescue the Israelis? My clan is the least
significant in the whole tribe descended from Manasseh, and I am the least significant
person in my whole family!”
16 Yahweh said to him, “I will help you. So you will defeat the army of Midian as
easily as if you were fighting only one man!”
17 Gideon replied, “If you are truly pleased with me, do something which will prove
that you who are speaking to me are really Yahweh.
18 But do not go away until I go and bring back an offering to you.”
Yahweh answered, “Okay, I will stay here until you return.”
19 Gideon hurried to his home. He killed a young goat and cooked it. Then he took
◄a half a bushel/18 liters► of flour and baked some bread without yeast. Then he
put the cooked meat in a basket, and put the broth from the meat in a pot, and took
it to Yahweh, who was sitting under the tree.
20 Then Yahweh said to him, “Put the meat and the bread on this rock. Then pour
the broth on top of it.” So Gideon did that.
21 Then Yahweh touched the meat and bread with the walking stick that was in his
hand. A fire flamed up from the rock and burned up everything that Gideon had
brought! And then Yahweh disappeared.
22 When Gideon realized that it was really Yahweh who had appeared in the form of
an angel and talked with him, he exclaimed, “O, Yahweh, I have seen you face-to-face
when you had the form of an angel! So I will surely die!”
23 But Yahweh called to him and said, “Do not be afraid! You will not die because
of seeing me!”
JUDGES 6:24
356
JUDGES 6:40
24 Then Gideon built an altar to worship Yahweh there. He named it ‘Yahweh gives
descendants of Abiezer.
father’s herd, the bull that is seven years old. Kill it. Then tear down the altar that
goddess Astarte that is there beside it.
26 Then build a stone altar to worship me, your God Yahweh, here on this hill. Take
the wood from the pole you cut down and make a fire to cook the meat of the bull as
a burnt offering to me.”
27 So Gideon and his servants did what Yahweh commanded. But they did it at
night, because he was afraid what the other members of his family and the other
men in town would do to him if they found out that he had done that.
28 Early the next morning, as soon as the men got up, they saw that the altar to
Baal had been torn down, and the pole for worshiping Astarte was gone. They saw
that there was a new altar there, and on it was what remained from the bull they
had sacrificed.
29 The people asked each other, “Who did this?” After they investigated, someone
told them that it was Gideon, the son of Joash, who had done it.
30 They went to Joash and said to him, “Bring your son out here! ◄He must be
executed/We must kill him►, because he destroyed our god Baal’s altar and cut down
the pole for our goddess Astarte!”
31 But Joash replied, “Are you trying to defend Baal? Are you trying to argue his
case? Anyone who tries to defend Baal should be executed by tomorrow morning! If
Baal is truly a god, he ought to be able to defend himself, and to get rid of the person
who tore down his altar!”
32 From that time, people called Gideon Jerub-Baal, which means ‘Baal should
defend himself’, because he tore down Baal’s altar.
33 Soon after that, the armies of the people of Midian and of Amalek and the people
from the east gathered together. They crossed the Jordan River to attack the Israelis.
They set up their tents in Jezreel Valley.
34 Then Yahweh’s Spirit took control of Gideon. He blew a ram’s horn to summon
the men to prepare to fight. So the men of the clan of Abiezer came to him.
35 He also sent messengers throughout the tribes descended from the four tribes of
Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali to tell their soldiers to come, and all of them
came.
36 Then Gideon said to God, “If you are truly going to enable me to rescue the Israeli
37 confirm it by doing this: Tonight I will put a dry wool fleece on the ground where
dry, then I will know that I am the one you will enable to rescue the people of Israel
38 And that is what happened. When Gideon got up the next morning, he picked
39 Then Gideon said to God, “Do not be angry with me, but let me ask you to do one
more thing. Tonight I will put the fleece out again. This time, let the fleece remain
dry, while the ground is wet with the dew.”
40 So that night, God did what Gideon asked him to do. The next morning the fleece
was dry, but the ground was covered with dew.

Gideon and his men defeated the army from Midian
1 The next morning, Gideon and his men got up early and went as far as Harod
Spring. The army of Midian was camped north of them, in the valley near Moreh
2 Yahweh said to Gideon, “You have too many soldiers with you. If I allow all of
they defeated their enemies by themselves, without my help.
home.’ ” So after Gideon told that to them, 22,000 of them went home. Only 10,000
men were left there.
4 But Yahweh told Gideon, “There are still too many men! Take them down to the
spring, and there I will choose from among them, which ones will go with you and
which ones will not go.”.
5 When Gideon took the men down to the spring, Yahweh told him, “When they
drink, put into one group the ones who scoop the water into their hands, and then
lap it up like dogs do. Put into another group the ones who kneel down and bend over
and drink with their mouths in the water.”
6 So when they drank, only 300 men drank from their hands. All the others drank
with their mouths down in the water.
7 Then Yahweh told Gideon, “The 300 men who lapped the water from their hands
will be your army! I will enable them to defeat the Midian army. Let all the others
go home!”
8 So Gideon’s 300 men collected the food and rams’ horns from all the other men,
and then he sent them home.
The men of Midian were camping in the valley below Gideon.
9 That night, Yahweh said to Gideon, “Get up and go down to their camp, and you
will hear something that will convince you that I will enable your men to defeat them.
10 But if you are afraid to attack them by yourself, take your servant Purah with
you.
11 Go down and listen to what some of the Midian soldiers are saying. Then you
will be very encouraged, and you will be ready to attack their camp.” So Gideon took
Purah with him, and they went down to the edge of the enemy camp.
12 The armies of the people of Midian and Amalek and from the east had set up
their tents and looked like a swarm of locusts. It seemed that their camels were as
impossible to count as the grains of sand on the seashore.
13 Gideon crept closer and heard one man telling a friend about a dream. He said,
“I just had a dream, and in the dream I saw a round loaf of barley bread tumble down
into our Midian camp. It struck a tent so hard that the tent turned upside down and
collapsed!”
14 His friend said, “Your dream can mean only one thing. It means that God will
enable Gideon, the man of Israel, to defeat all of the armies that are here with us
men from Midian.”
15 When Gideon heard the man tell about his dream and the meaning of that dream,
he thanked God. Then he and Purah returned to the Israeli camp, and he shouted to
the men, “Get up! Because God is enabling you to defeat the men from Midian!”
16 He divided his men into three groups. He gave each man a ram’s horn and an
empty clay jar. He also gave each of them a torch that they lit.
17 Then he said to them, “Watch me. When we come close to the enemy camp,
spread out to surround the camp. Then do exactly what I do.
JUDGES 7:18
358
JUDGES 8:6
18 As soon as I and the men with me blow our ram’s horns, you men in the other
two groups surrounding the camp blow your horns and shout, ‘We are doing this for
Yahweh and for Gideon!’ ”
19 A while before midnight, just after a new group of Israeli guards took the places
of the previous group, Gideon and the 100 men with him arrived at the edge of the
Midian camp. Suddenly they all blew their horns, and broke their jars.
20 Then the men in all three groups blew their horns and smashed their jars. They
held the torches high with their left hands, and held up the horns with their right
hands and alternatively blew them and shouted, “We have swords to fight for Yahweh
and for Gideon!”
21 Each of Gideon’s men stood in his position around the enemy camp. As they
watched, all the Midian men started running around and shouting in a panic.
22 While the 300 Israeli men kept blowing their horns, Yahweh caused their enemies
to start fighting each other with their swords/daggers. Some of them killed each other.
The rest fled. Some fled south to Beth-Shittah. Some fled to Zerarah village, near
Tabbath.
23 Then Gideon sent messages to the soldiers in the areas where the descendants
of Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh lived, to tell them to come and pursue the army of
Midian.
24 He also sent messengers throughout the hilly area where the descendants of
Ephraim lived, saying, “Come down to attack the army of Midian. Come down to the
Jordan River, to the place where people can wade across, to prevent enemy troops
from crossing it! Station men as far south as Beth-Barah.”
So the men of Ephraim did what Gideon told them to do.
25 They also captured Oreb and Zeeb, the two generals of the Midian army. They
killed Oreb at the big rock which is now called the rock of Oreb, and they killed
Zeeb at the place where people crush grapes that is now called the winepress of Zeeb.
Afterwards, the Israelis cut off the heads of Oreb and Zeeb and brought them to
Gideon, while he was near the Jordan River.
8
Gideon killed Zebah and Zalmunna
1 Then the descendants of Ephraim said to Gideon, “Why have you acted toward us
like this? When you went out to fight against the people of Midian, why did you not
summon us to help you?” They rebuked Gideon severely.
2 But Gideon replied, “I have done [RHQ] very little compared with what you have
done! My small clan of descendants of Abiezer only started the battle, but your very
large group of descendants of Ephraim helped me to finish the task very well. It is like
the final grapes of the harvest being much better than the first grapes that are picked.
3 God enabled you to defeat Oreb and Zeeb, the generals of the army from Midian.
That is [RHQ] much more important than what I did!” After Gideon told them that,
they no longer resented what he had done.
4 Then Gideon and his 300 men went east and crossed the Jordan River. Although
they were very tired, they continued to pursue their enemies.
5 When they arrived at Succoth town, Gideon said to the town leaders, “Please give
my men some food! They are very tired. We are pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the
kings of Midian.”
6 But the leaders of Succoth replied, “You have not caught [RHQ] Zebah and
Zalmunna yet. So why should we give food to your troops now? Catch them first,
JUDGES 8:25
7 Gideon replied, “Because you said that, after Yahweh enables us to defeat Zebah
and Zalmunna, we will return. And then we will make whips from thorns from the
desert, and with them we will rip the flesh off your bones!”
8 From there, Gideon and his 300 men went to Peniel and asked for food there, but
the people gave him the same answer.
9 So he said to the men of Peniel, “After I defeat those kings, I will return and tear
down this tower!”
10 By that time, Zebah and Zalmunna had gone to Karkor town with 15,000 troops.
They were all that were left of the armies that had come from the east. 120,000 of
their men had already been killed.
11 Gideon and his men went east along the road on which caravans travel. They
went past Nobah and Jogbehah villages and arrived at the enemy camp by surprise.
12 Zebah and Zalmunna fled, but Gideon’s men pursued them and captured them
and all their warriors.
13 After that, Gideon and his men took Zebah and Zalmunna with them and started
to return, going through Heres Pass.
14 There he captured a young man from Succoth, and demanded that he write down
the names of all of the leaders in the town. The young man wrote down seventy-seven
names.
15 Then Gideon and his men returned to Succoth and said to those leaders, “Here
are Zebah and Zalmunna. When we were here before, you made fun of me and said
‘You have not [RHQ] caught Zebah and Zalmunna yet! After you catch them, we will
give your exhausted men some food.’ ”
16 Then Gideon’s men took the town leaders and whipped them with whips made
from briers from the desert, to teach them that they deserved to be punished for not
giving them any food.
17 Then they went to Peniel and tore down the tower, and killed all the men in the
town.
18 Then Gideon said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “The men you killed near Tabor
Mountain, what did they look like?”
They replied, “They were like you; they all looked like they were sons of a king.”
19 Gideon replied, “They were my brothers! Just as surely as Yahweh lives, I would
not kill you if you had not killed them.”
20 Then he turned to his oldest son, Jether. He said to him, “Kill them!” But Jether
was only a boy, and he was afraid, so he did not pull out his dagger to kill them.
21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon, “Do not ask a young boy to do the
work that a man should do!” So Gideon killed both of them. Then he took the gold
ornaments from the necks of their camels.
Gideon refused to be their king
22 Then a group of Israeli men came to Gideon and said to him, “You be our ruler!
We want you and your son and your grandsons to be our rulers, because you rescued
us from the Midian army.”
23 But Gideon replied, “No, I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over
you. Yahweh will rule over you.”
24 Then he said, “I request only one thing. I request that each of you give me one

360
JUDGES 9:8
26 The weight of all the earrings was ◄43 pounds/19.4 kg.►.
That did not include
other things that they gave to Gideon—the other ornaments or the pendants or the
clothes that the kings of Midian wore or the gold chains that were on the necks of
their camels.
27 Gideon made/decorated a sacred vest from the gold, and later he put it in his
hometown, Ophrah. But soon the Israeli people started to worship the vest. So
it became like a trap [MET] for the people, causing them to worship it instead of
worshiping only God.
Gideon died
28 That is how the Israelis defeated the people from Midian. The people of Midian
did not become strong enough to attack Israel again. So while Gideon was alive, there
was peace in the land for 40 years.
29 Gideon went back home to live there.
30 He had many wives, and they bore him seventy sons.
31 He also had a slave wife in Shechem town, who bore him a son whom he named
Abimelech.
32 Gideon died when he was very old. They buried his body in the grave where
his father Joash was buried, at Ophrah, in the land belonging to the descendants of
Abiether.
33 But as soon as Gideon died, the Israelis stopped worshiping God and started
worshiping the images of the god Baal, like [MET] adultresses leave their husbands
and go to sleep with other men. They made a statue of a new god called Baal-Berith.
34 They forgot about Yahweh, the one who had rescued them from all their enemies
that surrounded them.
35 And even though Gideon had done many good things for the Israelis, they were
not kind to Gideon’s family.
Abimelech became king in Shechem
9
1 Gideon’s son Abimelech went to talk with his mother’s brothers in Shechem city.
He said to them and to all his mother’s relatives,
2 “Ask all the leaders of your city: ‘Do you think it would be good for all 70 of
Gideon’s sons to rule over you? Or would it be better to have only one of his sons,
me, to rule over you?’ And do not forget that I am your relative! [MTY]”
Abimelech had said. They said to each other, “We should allow Abimelech to rule
4 So the leaders of Shechem took from the temple of their god Baal-Berith ◄almost
worthless troublemakers to help him, and they went with Abimelech wherever he
went.
5 They went to Ophrah, his father’s town, and murdered 69 of his 70 brothers, the
sons of his father Gideon. They killed all those men on one huge rock. But Gideon’s
youngest son Jotham hid from Abimelech and his men, and he escaped.
6 Then all the leaders of Shechem and Beth-Millo gathered under the big sacred
tree in Shechem. There they appointed Abimelech to be their leader.
7 When Jotham heard about that, he climbed up Gerizim Mountain. He stood at the
top of the mountain and shouted to the people down below, “You leaders of Shechem,
listen to me, in order that God will listen to you!
8 One day the trees decided to appoint a king to rule over all of them. So they said
to the olive tree, ‘You be our king!’
JUDGES 9:9
361
JUDGES 9:27
9 “But the olive tree said, ‘No!
I will not be your king Men and gods enjoy the oil
from my fruit. I will not [RHQ] stop producing olives from which we make that oil, in
order to rule over you other trees!’
10 “Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come and be our king!’
11 “But the fig tree replied, ‘No! I do not want to [RHQ] stop producing my good
12 “Then the trees said to the grapevine, ‘Come and be our king!’
13 “But the grapevine replied, ‘No! I will not be your king The new wine that is made
from my grapes causes people and gods who drink it to become very happy. I do not
want to stop producing grapes and rule over you other trees!’ [RHQ]
14 “Then all the trees said to the thornbush, ‘Come and be our king!’
15 “The thornbush replied, ‘If you truly want to appoint me to be your king, come
into the shade of my tiny branches. But if you do not want to do that, I hope/desire
that fire will come out from me and burn up all the huge cedar trees in Lebanon

16 “After Jotham finished telling them this parable, he said, “So now I ask you, were
you being completely honest and sincere when you appointed Abimelech to be your
king [RHQ]? And have you treated Gideon and his family [RHQ] fairly? Have you
rewarded Gideon by honoring him as he deserved because of all the good things he
did for you? No!
17 “Do not forget that my father fought a battle for you, and he was willing to die
for you if that had been necessary, to save you from the Midian people-group.
18 But now you have rebelled against my father’s family, and you have killed 69 of
his sons on one huge rock. And you have appointed Abimelech—who is the son of
my father’s slave girl, not the son of his wife—to be the king who will rule you people
of Shechem. You have done that only because he is one of your relatives!
19 So, if today you have truly acted fairly and sincerely toward Gideon and his
family, I hope/desire that he will cause you to be happy and that you will cause him
to be happy.
of you leaders of Shechem and Beth-Millo with fire! And I also hope/desire that the
21 After Jotham finished saying that, he escaped from them and ran away to Beer
kill him.
Abimelech and his men killed the people of Shechem
22 Abimelech became the leader of all the people of Israel. He ruled them for three
years.
23 Then God sent an evil spirit to cause trouble between Abimelech and the leaders
of Shechem, with the result that the leaders of Shechem rebelled against Abimelech.
24 The leaders of Shechem had previously helped Abimelech to kill 69 of Gideon’s
sons, who were his brothers. So now God sent the evil spirit to punish all of them.
25 The leaders of Shechem ◄set an ambush/sent men to hide► on the hilltops to
ambush Abimelech. Those men robbed everyone who passed by. But someone told
Abimelech about it, so he did not go near them.
26 There was a man named Gaal, the son of Ebed, who moved into Shechem city,
along with his brothers. Soon the leaders of Shechem started to trust him.
27 They went out of the city to their vineyards and picked some grapes. They pressed
the grapes to make juice, and then they made wine. Then they had a feast in the temple
JUDGES 9:28
362
JUDGES 9:45
of their god, and they ate a lot of food and drank a lot of wine. Then they cursed
Abimelech.
28 Gaal said, “◄Why should we allow Abimelech to rule over us?/We should not
allow Abimelech to rule over us!► [RHQ] He is only one of Gideon’s sons so he really
does not belong to us [RHQ]! And he appointed Zebul, the governor of our city, to
be his deputy! We should ◄serve/be loyal to► one of the descendants of Hamor, the
founder of our city, and let him be our leader, not Abimelech [RHQ]!
29 If you would appoint me to be your leader, I would get rid of Abimelech. I would
say to him, ‘Get your army ready, and then come to fight us!’ ”
30 When someone told Zebul what Gaal said, he was very angry.
31 He secretly sent some messengers to Abimelech. They told him, “Gaal and his
brothers have come here to Shechem, and they are causing the people of the city to
rebel against you.
32 You and your men should get up during the night and go and hide in the fields
outside the city.
33 As soon as the sun rises in the morning, get up and attack the city. When Gaal
and his men come out to fight against you, you can do to them whatever you want
to.”
34 So Abimelech and all the men who were with him got up during the night. They
divided into four groups, and hid in the fields near Shechem.
35 The next morning, Gaal went out and stood at the entrance to the city gate. While
he was standing there, Abimelech and his soldiers came out of their hiding places
and started walking toward the city.
36 When Gaal saw the soldiers, he said to Zebul, “Look! There are people coming
down from the hills!”
people; they only resemble people.”
top of the sacred mountain! There is a group of them coming down from where the
38 Zebul said to Gaal, “Now ◄what good is your bragging?/ your bragging is
allow Abimelech to rule over us►?’ You made fun of these men. So now go out and
fight them!”
39 So Gaal led the men of Shechem outside the city to fight Abimelech and his men.
40 Abimelech and his men pursued them, and they killed many of Gaal’s men before
they could return safely inside the city gate.
41 Abimelech then stayed at Arumah, about five miles away from Shechem, and
Zebul’s men forced Gaal and his brothers to leave Shechem.
42 The next day, the people of Shechem got ready to leave the city and work in their
fields. When someone told Abimelech about that,
43 he divided his men into three groups, and told them to hide in the fields. So they
did that. And when they saw the people coming out of the city, they jumped up and
attacked them.
44 Abimelech and the men who were with him ran to the city gate. The other two
groups ran out to the people in the fields and attacked them.
45 Abimelech and his men fought all day. They captured the city and killed all the
people. They tore down all the buildings, and then they threw salt over the ruins in
order that nothing would grow there again.
They killed the people in the fortress
JUDGES 9:46
363
JUDGES 10:5
46 When the leaders who lived in the tower/fortress outside of Shechem heard what
had happened, they ran and hid inside the fortress, which was also a temple of their
god El-Berith.
47 But someone told Abimelech that all the leaders had gathered there.
48 So he and all the men who were with him went up Zalmon Mountain which is
near Shechem. Abimelech cut some branches of trees with an axe, and put them on
his shoulders. Then he said to all the men who were with him, “Quickly, do what I
have just done!”
49 So his men all cut branches then carried them down the mountain, following
Abimelech. They went to the fortress and piled the branches against its walls. Then
they kindled a fire, and the fire burned down the fortress and killed all the people
who were inside. So all the people who were inside the fortress—about 1,000 men
and women—died.
Abimelech was killed
50 Then Abimelech and his men went to Thebes city.
captured it.
of the city ran to the tower. When they were all inside, they locked the door. Then
they climbed up to the roof of the tower.
52 Abimelech and his men came to the tower and tried to get in the door, but they
could not. Then Abimelech prepared to light a fire to burn down the door.
53 But when Abimelech came near the doorway, a woman who was on the roof
dropped a big grinding stone on his head, and crushed his skull.
54 Abimelech quickly called to the young man who carried Abimelech’s weapons,
and said, “Pull out your sword and kill me with it! I do not want people to say ‘It was
a woman who killed Abimelech.’ ” So the young man thrust his sword into Abimelech,
and Abimelech died.
55 When the Israeli soldiers saw that Abimelech was dead, they all returned to their
homes.
56 In that way God punished Abimelech for the evil things that he had done to his
father and especially for killing all 69 of his brothers.
57 God also punished the men of Shechem for the evil things that they had done.
And when those things happened, it fulfilled what Gideon’s son Jotham said when he
cursed Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem.
10
Tola ruled the Israelis
1 After Abimelech died, Tola the son of Puah and grandson of Dodo became the
leader to rescue the Israeli people from their enemies. He belonged to the tribe
of Issachar, but he lived in Shamir city in the hilly area where the descendants of
Ephraim live.
2 He ruled the Israeli people for 23 years. Then he died and was buried in Shamir.
Jair ruled the Israelis
3 After Tola died, Jair, from the Gilead region, became the Israelis’ leader, and he
ruled them for 22 years.
4 He had thirty sons, and each of them had his own donkey to ride on. They each
controlled a different town in the Gilead region. That region is still named ‘The Towns
of Jair’.
5 When Jair died, he was buried in Kamon city.

JUDGES 11:6
The Ammon people-group oppressed the Israelis
6 Again the Israelis did things that Yahweh said were wrong/evil. They worshiped
the idols of their god Baal and their goddess Astarte. They also worshiped the gods
of the Aram, Sidon, Moab, and Ammon people-groups, and the gods of the Philistia
people-group. They abandoned Yahweh and stopped worshiping him.
7 So Yahweh was very angry with them, and he allowed the Philistia and Ammon
people-groups to defeat [IDM] the Israelis.
8 In that same year, those people started to oppress the Israelis who lived in the
Gilead region on the east side of the Jordan River. That was where the Amor peoplegroup also lived. were They caused the Israelis who lived in that region to suffer for
18 years.
against the people of the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim. They caused the
10 So the Israelis cried out to Yahweh, saying “We have sinned against you. We have
11 Yahweh answered them, saying, “When the people of Egypt, and the Amor and
Ammon and Philistia people-groups
12 and the Sidon and Amalek and Maon people-groups were cruel to you, you cried
out to me, and then I rescued you.
13 But now you have abandoned me again, and you have been worshiping other
gods. So I will not rescue you again.
14 You have chosen those gods to be the ones that you worship. So call to them to
help you. Allow them to rescue you when you have a lot of trouble!”
15 But the Israeli people said to Yahweh, “Truly we have sinned. Punish us in
whatever way you wish to, but please rescue us now!”
16 Then the Israelis threw away the idols of the gods that belonged to other peoplegroups, and they worshiped Yahweh again. He saw that they were suffering very
much, and he felt sorry [IDM] for them.
17 The Ammon people-group gathered to fight against the Israelis, and they set up
their tents in the Gilead region. The Israeli men also gathered and set up their tents
at Mizpah, which was a city in Gilead.
18 The Israeli leaders said, “Who will lead our soldiers to attack the Ammon peoplegroup? The one who will lead us will become the leader of all us who live in this
Gilead region.”
11
Jephthah was chosen to be their leader
1 There was a man from the Gilead region named Jephthah. He was a great warrior.
His father was also named Gilead. But his mother was a prostitute.
2 Gilead’s wife gave birth to several sons. When they grew up, they forced Jephthah
to leave home, saying to him, “You are the son of a prostitute, not the son of our
mother. So when our father dies, you will not receive any of his property.”
3 So Jephthah ran away from his brothers, and he went to the Tob region. While
he was there, some worthless men started to spend a lot of time with him.
4 Some time later, the Ammon people-group started to fight against the Israelis.
5 When that happened [DOU], the leaders of the Gilead region went to Jephthah to
bring him back from the Tob region to their area.
6 They said to him, “Come with us and lead our army, and help us to fight against
the men from the Ammon people-group!”
JUDGES 11:7
365
JUDGES 11:21
7 But Jephthah replied, “You hated me [RHQ] previously!
You forced me to leave
my father’s house! So why are you coming to me now, asking me to help you when
you are experiencing trouble?”
8 The leaders from Gilead replied, “Yes, we are having trouble, and that is the reason
that we have come to you now. If you come with us and help us to fight against the
Ammon people-group, after we defeat them, we will appoint you to be the leader of
9 Jephthah replied, “If I go back to Gilead with you to fight against the Ammon
your leader?”
10 They replied, “Yahweh is listening to everything that we say. So he will punish us
if we do not do everything that you tell us to do.”
11 So Jephthah went with them back to the Gilead region, and the people appointed
him to be their leader and the commander of their army. And Jephthah solemnly
promised to Yahweh there at Mizpah to serve him well.
Jephthah’s message to the king of the Ammon people-group
12 Jephthah sent some messengers to the king of the Ammon people-group. They
asked the king, “What have we done to make you angry, with the result that your
army is coming to fight against the people in our land?”
13 The king replied, “We have come to fight against you Israelis because you took our
land when you came here from Egypt. You took all our land east of the Jordan River,
from the Arnon River in the south to the Jabbok River in the north. So if you now give
it back to us, there ◄will be peace between us/we will not fight against you►.”
14 The messengers returned to Jephthah and told him what the king had said. So
Jephthah sent the messengers to the king again.
15 They said to him, “This is what Jephthah says: ‘It is not true that we Israelis took
the land from the Moab people-group and the Ammon people-group.
16 When the Israeli people came out of Egypt, they walked through the desert to the
Red Sea, and then walked across it and traveled to Kadesh town at the border of the
Edom region.
17 They sent messengers to the king of the Edom people-group, to say to him, “Please
allow us Israelis to walk across your land.” But the king of the Edom people-group
refused. Later we sent the same message to the king of the Moab people-group, but
he also refused to allow the Israelis to go through his land. So the Israelis stayed at
Kadesh for a long time.
18 Then the Israelis went into the desert and walked outside the borders of the
Edom and Moab regions. They walked east of the Moab region, east of the Arnon
River, which is the eastern border of the Moab region. They did not cross that river to
enter the Moab region.
19 ‘Then the Israelis sent a message to Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group,
who lived in Heshbon city. They asked him, “Will you please allow us Israeli people
to cross through your land to arrive at the land to which we are going.”
20 But Sihon did not trust the Israelis; he thought that they would steal some of the
things in his land. So he gathered all his troops and they set up their tents at Jahaz
village and then they attacked the Israelis.
21 But Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship, enabled the Israeli army to
defeat [IDM] Sihon and his army. Then they ◄took possession of/started to live in►
all the land where the Amor people-group had lived.
JUDGES 11:22
366
JUDGES 11:37
22 The Israelis took all the land that belonged to the Amor people-group, from the
Arnon River in the south to the Jabbok River in the north, and from the desert in the
east to the Jordan River in the west.
23 ‘It was Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship, who forced the Amor people-
group to leave as the Israelis advanced. So do you now think that you can force the

26 For 300 years the Israeli people have lived in Heshbon and Aroer cities in your
region, and in the surrounding towns, and in all the cities along the Arnon River. Why
have you people of the Ammon people-group not taken back those cities during all
those years [RHQ]?
27 We have not sinned against you, but you are sinning against me by attacking me
and my army. I trust that Yahweh, the great judge, will decide whether we Israelis
are right, or whether you people of the Ammon people-group are right.’ ”
28 But the king of the Ammon people-group did not pay attention to that message
from Jephthah.
29 Then the Spirit of Yahweh took control of Jephthah. Jephthah went through the
Gilead region and through the area where the tribe of Manasseh lived, to enlist/gather
men for his army. He finally gathered them together in Mizpah city in the Gilead region
to fight against the Ammon people-group.
30 There Jephthah made a solemn promise to Yahweh. He said, “If you will enable
my army to defeat [IDM] the Ammon people-group,
31 when I return from the battle, I will sacrifice to you the first person who comes
out of my house to greet me. It will be a sacrifice that will be completely burned on
the altar.”
32 Then Jephthah and his men went from Mizpah to attack the Ammon people-group,
and Yahweh enabled his army to defeat them.
33 Jephthah and his men killed them, from Aroer city all the way to the area around
the city of Minnith. They destroyed 20 cities, as far as the city of Abel Keramim. So
the Israelis completely defeated the Ammon people-group.
34 When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, his daughter was the first one
to come out of the house to meet him. She was joyfully playing a tambourine and
dancing. She was his only child; he had no sons and no other daughters.
35 When Jephthah saw his daughter, he tore his clothes to show that he was very
sad about what he was going to do. He said to her, “My daughter, you have caused me
to become very sad [DOU] because I made a solemn promise to Yahweh to sacrifice
the first one who came out of my house, and I must do what I promised.”
36 His daughter said, “My father, you made a solemn promise to Yahweh.
So you
must do to me what you promised, because you said that you would do that if Yahweh
helped you to defeat our enemies, the Ammon people-group.”

JUDGES 11:38
367
JUDGES 12:11
38 Jephthah replied, “All right, you may go.”
So she left for two months. She and
her friends stayed in the hills and they cried for her because she would never be
married.
39 After two months, she returned to her father Jephthah, and he did to her what
he had vowed. So his daughter never was married.
Because of that, the Israelis now have a custom.
40 Every year the young Israeli women go into the hills for four days to remember
and cry about what happened to the daughter of Jephthah.
12
Jephthah’s army defeated the tribe of Ephraim
1 The men of the tribe of Ephraim summoned their soldiers, and they crossed the
Jordan River to the town of Zaphon to talk with Jephthah. They said to him, “◄Why
did you not ask us for help?/You should have requested us► to help your army fight
the Ammon people-group. So we will burn down your house while you are in it.”
2 Jephthah replied, “The Ammon people-group were oppressing us greatly. When
we were prepared to start to attack them, I requested you to come and help us, but
you refused. My men and I defeated the Ammon people-group, but you did not help
us.
3 When I saw that you would not help us, I was willing to be killed in the battle
against the Ammon people-group. But Yahweh helped us to defeat them. You did
not help us when we requested it before, so ◄why have you come here today to fight
against me?/you should not have come here today to fight against me.►” [RHQ]
4 Then Jephthah summoned the men of the Gilead region to fight against the men
of the tribe of Ephraim. The men of the tribe of Ephraim said, “You men from the
Gilead region are men who deserted us. Long ago you left us and moved to the area
between our tribe and the tribe of Manasseh.” Because of their saying that, the men
of the Gilead region attacked the men of the tribe of Ephraim.
5 The men of Gilead captured that ◄ford/place where people can walk across► at
the Jordan River to go to the land where the tribe of Ephraim live. Whenever one of
the soldiers from the tribe of Ephraim came to the ford to try to escape, he would
say, “Let me cross the river.” Then the men of Gilead would ask him, “Are you from
the tribe of Ephraim?” If he said “No,”
6 they would say to him, “Say the word ‘Shibboleth’.” The men of Ephraim could
‘Sibboleth’, they would know that he was lying and that he was really from the tribe of
Ephraim, and they would kill him there at the ford.
So the men of Gilead killed 42,000 people from the tribe of Ephraim at that time.
7 Jephthah, the man from the Gilead region, was a leader of the Israeli people for six
years. Then he died and was buried in a town in the Gilead region.
Ibzan became their leader
8 After Jephthah died, a man named Ibzan, from Bethlehem, became the leader of
the Israeli people.
9 He had 30 sons and 30 daughters. He forced all his daughters to marry men who
were not in his clan, and brought women from outside his clan to marry his sons. He
was the leader of the Israeli people for seven years.
10 When he died, he was buried in Bethlehem.
Elon became their leader
11 After Ibzan died, a man named Elon, from the tribe of Zebulun, became the
leader of the Israeli people. He was their leader for ten years.
JUDGES 12:12
368
JUDGES 13:15
12 Then he died and was buried in Aijalon city in the area where the tribe of Zebulun
lives.
Abdon became their leader
13 After Elon died, a man named Abdon who was the son of Hillel, from Pirathon
city, in the area where the tribe of Ephraim live became the leader of the Israeli people.
14 He had 40 sons and 30 grandsons. Each of them had his own donkey on which
to ride. Abdon was the leader of the Israeli people for eight years.
15 When Abdon died, he was buried in Pirathon, in the hilly area where the
descendants of Amalek lived previously, but now it is the area where the tribe of
Ephraim lives.
Samson was born
13
1 Again the Israeli people did things that Yahweh said were very evil.
So Yahweh
enabled the people of Philistia to conquer them. They ruled over the Israelis for 40
years.
2 There was a man named Manoah from the descendants of Dan who lived in Zorah
town. His wife was unable to become pregnant, so they had no children.
3 One day, Yahweh appeared to Manoah’s wife in the form of an angel, and said to
her, “Even though you have not been able to give birth to any children until now, you
will soon become pregnant and give birth to a son.
4 From now until he is born, you must not drink any wine or other alcoholic/
fermented drink, and you must not eat any food that will make you unacceptable
to God.
5 After you give birth to your son, you must never allow his hair to be cut. He must
be dedicated to God from the day he is born until the day he dies. He is the one who
will rescue many of the Israeli people from the people of Philistia.”
6 The woman ran and told her husband, “A prophet came to me. He looked
awesome, like an angel from God. I did not ask where he came from, and he did
not tell me his name.
7 But he told me, ‘You will become pregnant and give birth to a son. Until then, you
must not drink any wine or any alcoholic/fermented drink, and you must not eat any
food that would make you unacceptable to God. Your son must be dedicated to God
from the day he is born until the day he dies.’ ”
8 Then Manoah prayed to Yahweh, saying, “O Yahweh, I plead with you, allow that
prophet whom you sent to us to come again, and teach us how we should raise the
boy who will be born to us.”
9 God did what Manoah asked, and Yahweh again appeared to his wife in the form
of an angel, while she was out in the field. But again her husband Manoah was not
with her.
10 So she quickly ran and said to her husband, “The man who appeared to me a
11 Manoah ran back with his wife, and asked, “Are you the man who talked with
12 Manoah asked him, “When what you promised occurs and my wife gives birth to
a son, what rules must he obey, and what work will he do when he grows up?”
13 Yahweh replied, “Your wife must obey all the instructions I gave her.
14 Before the baby is born, she must not eat grapes, or drink wine or any other
alcoholic/fermented drink, or eat anything that would make her unacceptable to God.”
15 Then Manoah said, “Please stay here until we can kill and cook a young goat for
you.”
JUDGES 13:16
369
JUDGES 14:9
16 Yahweh replied, “I will stay here, but I will not eat anything. However, you may
kill an animal and sacrifice it as a burned offering to Yahweh.” (Manoah did not
realize that the man he thought was an angel was really Yahweh.)
17 Then Manoah asked him, “What is your name? When what you have promised
happens, we want to honor you.”
18 Yahweh replied, “◄Why do you ask me my name?/You should not ask me my
name.► [RHQ] It is ◄wonderful/it cannot be understood►.”
19 Then Manoah killed a young goat and burned it on a rock, along with a grain
offering, as a sacrifice to Yahweh. And Yahweh did an amazing thing while Manoah
and his wife watched.
20 Flames from the altar blazed up toward the sky, and Yahweh ascended in the
flames. When Manoah and his wife saw that, they prostrated themselves on the
ground.
21 Although Yahweh did not appear in the form of an angel to Manoah and his wife
again, Manoah realized that the man they thought was an angel was really Yahweh.
22 So he said, “Now we will die, because we have seen God!”
23 But his wife said, “No, we will not die, because if Yahweh intended to kill us, he
would not have accepted the burned offering and the grain offering. And he would
not have appeared to us and told us the wonderful thing that would happen to us,
and he would not have performed this miracle.”
24 When their son was born, they named him Samson. Yahweh blessed him as he
grew up.
25 And while he was in Mahaneh-Dan, which is between Zorah and Eshtaol towns,
Yahweh’s Spirit began to control him.
14
Samson’s riddle
1 One day when Samson was in Timnah town, he saw a young Philistine woman
there.
2 When he returned home, he told his mother and father, “I saw a young Philistine
woman in Timnah, and I want you to get her for me so I can marry her.”
3 His mother and father objected very strongly. They said, “Is there no woman from
our tribe, or from the other Israeli tribes, that you could marry? Why must you go
But Samson told his father, “Get her for me! She is the one I want!”
preparing a way for Samson to defeat the Philistines, who were ruling over Israel at
5 So, as Samson was going down to Timnah, followed by his mother and father, a
young lion attacked Samson near the vineyards close to Timnah.
6 Then Yahweh’s Spirit came upon Samson powerfully, with the result that he tore
the lion apart with his hands. He did it as easily as if it were a young goat. But he
did not tell his mother and father about it.
7 When they arrived in Timnah, Samson talked with the young woman, and he liked
her very much. And his father made arrangements for the wedding.
8 Later, when Samson returned to Timnah for the wedding, he turned off the path
to see the carcass of the lion. He discovered that after other creatures had eaten all
the flesh, a swarm of bees had made a hive in the skeleton and had made some honey.
9 So he scooped some of the honey into his hands and ate some of it as he was
walking along. He also gave some of it to his mother and father, but he did not
JUDGES 15:2
tell them that he had taken the honey from the skeleton of the lion, because anyone
dedicated to God was not to touch any corpse.
10 As his father was making the final arrangements for the marriage, Samson gave
a party for the young men in that area. That was the custom for men to do when they
were about to be married.
11 Thirty young man were invited to the party.
12 Samson said to them, “Allow me to tell you a riddle. If you tel me the meaning of
my riddle during these seven days of the celebration, I will give each of you a linen
robe and an extra set of clothes.
13 But if you cannot tell me the meaning, you must each give me a linen robe and
an extra set of clothes.” They replied, “All right. Tell us your riddle.”
14 So he said,
“From the thing that eats came something to eat;
out of something strong came something sweet.”
But for three days they could not tell him the meaning of the riddle.
15 On the fourth day, they said to Samson’s bride, “Ask your husband to tell you the
meaning of the riddle. If you do not do that, we will burn down your father’s house,
with you inside it! Did you invite us here only to make us poor by forcing us to buy
a lot of clothes for your husband?”
16 So Samson’s wife came to him, crying, and said to him, “You do not really love
me. You hate me! You have told a riddle to my friends, but you have not told me the
meaning of the riddle!”
He replied, “I have not told the meaning of the riddle even to my mother and father,
so why should I tell it to you?”
17 She continued to cry every time she was with him, all during the rest of the
celebration. Finally, on the seventh day, because she continued to nag him, he told
her the meaning of the riddle. Then she told it to the young men.
18 So, before sunset on the seventh day, the young men came to Samson and said
to him,
“What/Nothing is sweeter than honey [RHQ].
What/Nothing is stronger than a lion [RHQ]!”
Samson replied, “You should not force a heifer to plow a field [MET].
Similarly, if you had not forced my bride to ask me about the riddle [MET],
19 Then Yahweh’s Spirit powerfully took control of Samson. He went down to the
Timnah and gave them to the men who had told him the meaning of the riddle. But
he was very angry about what had happened, so he went back home to live with his
mother and father.
20 So ◄Samson’s wife was given/the bride’s father gave Samson’s wife► to the man
who who had been Samson’s best man at the wedding, but Samson did not know that.

Samson got revenge on the Philistines
1 During the time that they harvested wheat, Samson took a young goat to Timnah
as a present for his wife. He planned to sleep with [EUP] his wife, but her father
would not let him go into her room.
2 He said to Samson, “I really thought that you hated her. So I gave her to the man
who had been your best man at the wedding, and she married him. But look, her
younger sister is [RHQ] more beautiful than she is. You can marry her!”
JUDGES 15:3
3 Samson
371
JUDGES 15:18
replied, “No! And this time I have a right to get revenge on you
Philistines!”
4 Then he went out into the fields and caught 300 foxes. He tied their tails together,
two-by-two. He fastened torches to each pair of tails.
5 Then he lit the torches and let the foxes run through the fields of the Philistines.
The fire from the torches burned all the grain to the ground, including the grain that
had been cut and piled in bundles. The fire also burned down their grapevines and
their olive trees.
6 The Philistines asked, “Who did this?” Someone told them, “Samson did it. He
married a woman from Timnah, but then his father-in-law gave her to the man who
was Samson’s best man at the wedding, and she married him.” So the Philistines
went to Timnah and got the woman and her father, and burned them to death.
7 Samson found out about that, and he said to them, “Because you have done this, I
will not stop until I get revenge on you!”
8 So he attacked the Philistines furiously, and killed many of them. Then he went
to hide in a cave in the large rock at a place called Etam.
9 The Philistines did not know where he was, so they went up to where the
descendants of Judah lived, set up their tents near Lehi town and then raided the
town.
10 The men there asked the Philistines, “Why have you attacked us?”
The Philistines replied, “We have come to capture Samson. We have come to get
revenge on him for what he did to us.”
11 Someone there knew where Samson was hiding. So 3,000 men from Judah went
down to get Samson at the cave in the rock where he was hiding. They said to Samson,
“Do you not realize that the people of Philistia are ruling over us? Do you not realize
what they will do to us?”
did to me.”
in the hands of the Philistines.”
13 They replied, “We will just tie you up and take you to the Philistines. We will not
14 When they arrived at Lehi, the Philistines came toward him, shouting
triumphantly. But Yahweh’s Spirit came upon Samson powerfully. He snapped the
ropes on his arms as easily as if they were stalks of burned flax, and the ropes fell
off his wrists.
15 Then he saw a donkey’s jawbone lying on the ground. It was fresh, so it was
hard. He picked it up and killed about 1,000 Philistine men with it.
16 Then Samson wrote this poem:
“With the jawbone of a donkey
I have made them like a heap of dead donkeys.
With the jawbone of a donkey
I killed 1,000 men.”
17 When he finished killing those men, he threw the jawbone away, and later that
place was called Jawbone Hill.
18 Then Samson was very thirsty, so he called out to Yahweh, “You have given me
strength to win a great victory. So now must I die because of being thirsty, with the
result that those heathen Philistines will take away my body and mutilate it?”
JUDGES 15:19
372
JUDGES 16:13
19 So God caused water to gush out of a depression in the ground at Lehi. Samson
drank from it and soon felt strong again. He named that place ‘The spring of the one
who called out’. That spring is still there at Lehi.
20 Samson was the leader of the Israeli people for 20 years, but during that time
the Philistines were the ones who really ruled over the land.
16
Samson removed the gate at Gaza
1 One day Samson went to Gaza city in the Philistia area. He spent some time with
a prostitute.
2 People soon found out that Samson was there, so the men of Gaza gathered
together at the city gate and waited all night. They said to themselves, “When it
dawns tomorrow morning, we will kill him when he tries to leave the city.”
3 But Samson did not stay there all night. At midnight, he got up. He went to the
city gate, he took hold of its two posts, and he lifted it up out of the ground, with
its connecting cross bar still attached. He put it on his shoulders and carried it many
miles uphill to Hebron.
4 Later Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, and started to live with
her. She lived in Sorek Valley in the Philistia area.
5 The Philistine leaders went to her and said, “Find out from Samson what makes
him so strong. And find out how we can subdue him and tie him up securely. If you
do that, each of us will give you 1,100 pieces of silver.”
6 So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me what makes you so strong, and tell me
how someone can subdue you and tie you up.”
7 Samson said, “If someone ties me with seven new bowstrings, ones that are not
dry yet, I will become as weak as other men.”
8 So after Delilah told that to the Philistine leaders, they brought seven new
bowstrings to Delilah.
9 Then she hid the men in one of the rooms in her house. Then while Samson was
sleeping, she tied him up with the bowstrings. Then she called out, “Samson! The
Philistines have come here to capture you!” But Samson snapped the bowstrings as
easily as though they were strings that had been singed in a fire. So the Philistines
did not find out what made Samson so strong.
10 Then Delilah said to Samson, “You have deceived me and lied to me! Now tell
me the truth, how someone can tie you up securely.”
11 Samson replied, “If someone ties me with new ropes, ones that have never been
used, I will be as weak as other men.”
12 So again, she told the Philistine leaders, and they came and hid in the room as
they had done before. And again, while Samson was sleeping, she took the new ropes
and tied him up with them. Then she called out, “Samson! The Philistines have come
to capture you!” But Samson snapped the ropes on his arms as easily as if they were
threads.
13 Then Delilah said, “You have deceived me and lied to me again! Please tell me
how someone can tie you up securely!” Samson replied, “If you weave the seven
braids of my hair into the threads you are weaving on the loom, and then fasten
those threads with the pin that makes the threads tight, then I will be as weak as
other men.”
So again, while Samson was sleeping on her lap, Delilah held the seven braids of
his hair, and wove them into the threads on the loom,
JUDGES 16:14
373
JUDGES 16:29
14 and
Philistines have come to capture you!” But Samson woke up and pulled out the pin,
15 Then Delilah said to him, “How can you say that you love me when you do not
have not told me what really makes you so strong!”
[IDM].
17 Finally Samson told her the truth. He said, “I have been set apart for God since
the day I was born. And because of that, my hair has never been cut. If my hair were
shaved off, my strength would be gone, and I would be as weak as other men.”
18 Delilah realized that this time he had told her the truth. So she summoned
the Philistine leaders again, saying, “Come back one more time, because Samson has
really told me everything about why he is so strong”. So the Philistine leaders returned
and brought to Delilah the money that they promised to give her.
19 Again she lulled Samson to sleep, with his head in her lap. Then she called one
of the Philistine men to come and shave off Samson’s hair. As he did that, Samson
began to get weaker. And finally his strength was all gone.
20 Then after she tied him up, she called out, “Samson! The Philistines have come
to capture you!”
He woke up and thought, “I will do as I did before. I will shake these ropes off
myself and be free!” But he did not realize that Yahweh had left him.
21 So the Philistine men seized him and gouged out his eyes. Then they took him to
Gaza. There they put him in prison and bound him with bronze chains. They made
him turn a millstone to grind grain every day.
22 But his hair started to grow again.
Samson killed many thousands of Philistines when he died
23 Several months later the Philistine leaders celebrated a big festival.
During the
festival they offered sacrifices to their god Dagon. They praised him, saying, “Our
god has enabled us to defeat our great enemy Samson!”
24 And when the other people saw Samson, they also praised their god Dagon,
saying,
“Samson ruined our crops and killed many of our people,
but our god has put our enemy into our hands.
Our god helped us to capture the one who has killed so many of us!”
25 By that time the people were half-drunk. They shouted, “Bring Samson out of
the prison! Bring him here so that he can entertain us!”
So they brought Samson from the prison and made fun of him. Then they made
him stand in the center of the temple. They made him stand between the two pillars
that held up the roof.
26 Samson said to the servant who was leading him by his hand, “Place my hands
against the two pillars. I want to rest against them.”
27 At that time the temple was full of men and women. All the Philistine leaders
were also there. And there were about 3,000 people on the roof, watching Samson
and making fun of him.
28 Then Samson prayed, saying, “Yahweh, my Lord, think about me again! Please
give me strength one more time, so that I may get revenge on the Philistines for
gouging out my eyes!”
29 Then Samson put his hands on the two center pillars of the temple. He put his
right hand on one pillar and his left hand on the other pillar.
JUDGES 16:30
30 Then he shouted to God, “Let me die with the Philistines!”, and he pushed with
all his strength. The pillars collapsed, and the temple crashed down on the Philistine
leaders and all the other Philistine people, and they all died. So Samson killed more
people when he died than he had killed all during his life.
31 Later his brothers and their relatives went down from Zorah to Gaza to get his
body. They took it back home and buried it between Zorah and Eshtaol, at the place
where Samson’s father Manoah was buried. Samson had been Israel’s leader for 20
years.
17
Micah made idols and hired a priest
1 There was a man named Micah who lived in the hilly area where the tribe of
Ephraim live.
2 One day he said to his mother, “I heard you curse whoever stole ◄1,100 pieces/
28 pounds/13 kg.► of silver from your house. I am the one who took the silver, and
I still have it.” His mother replied, “My son, I pray that Yahweh will bless you for
admitting that you took it.”
3 Micah gave all the silver back to his mother. Then she said to herself, “I will give
some of this silver to Yahweh.” And she said to her son, “My son, I want you to make
an idol and a statue from this silver. So I will give some of this silver back to you for
making these things.”
4 So when he gave all the silver to his mother, she took ◄200 pieces/about 5 pounds/
1.6 kg.► of it to a ◄silversmith/man who made things from silver►. With the silver
that man made an idol and a statue, and gave them to Micah. Micah put them in his
house.
5 He had in his house a special ◄shrine/place for putting sacred things►. He made
a sacred vest and some small idols and put them in this shrine along with the big idol
and the statue. Then Micah chose one of his sons to become his priest.
6 At that time, the Israeli people did not have a king. So Micah and everyone else
did whatever they considered to be the right thing to do.
7 There was a young man who had been living in Bethlehem in the area where the
tribe of Judah lives. He wanted to work as a priest because he was a member of the
tribe of Levi.
8 So he left Bethlehem to find another place to live and work. He came to Micah’s
house in the hilly area where the tribe of Ephraim live.
9 Micah asked him, “Where are you from?”
He replied, “I come from Bethlehem. I am from the tribe of Levi, and I am looking
for a place to live and work as a priest.”
10 Micah said to him, “Stay with me, and you can become like a father to counsel
me, and be my priest. Each year I will give to you ten pieces of silver and some new
clothes. And I will provide food for you.”
11 So the young man agreed to live with Micah. He became like one of Micah’s own
sons.
12 Micah appointed him to be a priest, and he lived in Micah’s house.
13 Then Micah said, “Now I know that Yahweh will do good things for me, because
I have a man from the tribe of Levi to be my priest.”
18
JUDGES 18:2
375
JUDGES 18:17
Also at that time, the tribe of Dan was still searching for some land where they
could live. The other Israeli tribes had been able to ◄capture/take possession of► the
land that had been allotted to them, but the tribe of Dan had not been able to do that.
2 So they chose five soldiers from their clans, men who lived in Zorah and Eshtaol
cities, to go through the land and explore it and try to find some land where their tribe
could live.
They came to Micah’s house in the hilly area where the tribe of Ephraim lived, and
they stayed there that night.
3 While they were in his house and they heard the young man who had become
Micah’s priest talking, they recognized from ◄his accent/the way that he talked► that
he was from the southern part of Israel. So they went to him and asked him, “Who
brought you here? What are you doing here? Why did you come here?”
4 He told them the things that Micah had done for him. And he said, “Micah ◄has
hired me/is paying me to work for him►, and I have become his priest.”
5 So they said to him, “Please ask God if we will succeed in what we are trying to
do on this journey.”
6 The young man replied, “Things will go well for you. Yahweh will go with you on
this journey.”
7 The next day the five men left. When they came to Laish city, they saw that the
people there lived safely, like the people in Sidon city did. The people there thought
that they were safe/protected from any enemies, and they had plenty of good fertile
land. They lived very far from the people of Sidon, so the people of Sidon would not be
able to help defend/protect them. They had no other ◄allies/groups nearby that would
help them in battles►.
8 When those five men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their relatives asked them
“What did you find out?”
9 They replied, “We have found some land, and it is very good. We should go and
attack the people who live there. Why are you staying here and doing nothing [RHQ]?
Do not wait any longer! We should go immediately and take possession of that land!
10 When you go there, you will see that there is plenty of land, and it has everything
that we will need. The people there are not expecting anyone to attack them. Surely
God is giving that land to us.”
11 So 600 men from the tribe of Dan left Zorah and Eshtaol, carrying their weapons.
12 On their way they set up their tents near Kiriath-Jearim city in the area where the
tribe of Judah lives. That is why the area west of Kiriath-Jearim was named ‘Camp of
Dan’, and that is still its name.
13 From there, they went to the hilly area where the tribe of Ephraim lives. And
they arrived at Micah’s house.
14 The five men who had explored the land near Laish said to their fellow Israelis,
“Do you know that in one of these houses there is a sacred vest, several idols, and a
statue? We think that you know what you should do.” [RHQ]
15 So they went to the house where the man from the tribe of Levi lived, which was
the house where Micah lived, and they greeted the young man from the tribe of Levi
16 The 600 men of the tribe of Dan stood outside the gate of the house, carrying
17 The five men who had explored the land went into Micah’s house, and took all
the idols, the sacred vest, and the statue. While they did that, the 600 men stood
outside the gate, talking with the priest.
JUDGES 18:18
376
JUDGES 19:2
18 When the priest saw them bringing out the idols and the sacred vest and the
statue, he said to them, “What are you doing?”
19 They replied, “Be quiet! Do not say anything! You come with us and be like a
father to us and a priest for us. Is it better for you to stay here and be a priest for the
people in the house of one man, or to be a priest for a clan, and a priest for a whole
tribe of Israelis?” [RHQ]
20 The priest liked what they were suggesting. So he took the sacred vest and the
idols, and he prepared to go with the men from the tribe of Dan.
21 They all put their little children and their animals and everything else that they
owned in front of them.
22 After they had gone a little distance from Micah’s house, Micah saw what was
happening. He quickly summoned the men who lived near him, and they ran and
caught up with the men from the tribe of Dan.
23 They shouted at them. The men of the tribe of Dan turned around and said to
Micah, “What is the problem? Why have you gathered these men to pursue us?”
24 Micah shouted, “You took the silver idols that were made for me! You also took
my priest! I do not have anything left [RHQ]! So why do you ask me, ‘What is the
problem?’ ”
25 The men from the tribe of Dan replied, “You should not shout loudly like that!
One of our angry men might attack you and kill you and your family!”
26 Then the men from the tribe of Dan continued walking. Micah realized that there
was a very large group of them, so that it would be useless for him to try to fight them.
So he turned around and went home.
27 The men of the tribe of Dan were carrying the things that had been made for
Micah, and they also took his priest, and they continued traveling to Laish. They
attacked the people who were peacefully living there, and killed them with their
swords, and then they burned everything in the city.
28 Laish was far from the city of Sidon, so the people of Sidon could not rescue the
people of Laish. And the people of Laish had no other allies. Laish was in a valley
near Beth-Rehob town.
The people of the tribe of Dan rebuilt the city and started to live there.
29 They gave to the city a new name, Dan, in honor of their ancestor Dan, who was
one of the sons of Jacob.
30 The people of the tribe of Dan set up in the city the idols that had been made
for Micah. Jonathan, who was the son of Gershom and the grandson of Moses, was
appointed to be their priest. His descendants continued to be priests until the Israelis
were captured and taken to Assyria.
31 After the people of the tribe of Dan set up the idols that had been made for
Micah, they worshiped those idols, even though the Sacred Tent where they had been
A Levite and his concubine
1 At that time the Israeli people had no king.
There was a man from the tribe of Levi who lived in a remote place in the hilly
area where the tribe of Ephraim lives. He had previously taken as a wife a woman
who was a slave. She was from Bethlehem, in the area where the tribe of Judah lives.
2 But she started to sleep with other men also. Then she left him and returned to
her father’s house in Bethlehem. She stayed there for four months.
JUDGES 19:3
377
JUDGES 19:21
3 Then her husband took his servant and two donkeys and went to Bethlehem. He
went to ask her to come back to live with him again. When he arrived at her father’s
house, she invited him to come in. Her father was happy to see him.
4 The woman’s father asked him to stay. So he stayed there for three days. During
that time he ate and drank and slept there.
5 On the fourth day, they all got up early in the morning. The man from the tribe
of Levi was preparing to leave, but the woman’s father said to him, “Eat something
before you go.”
6 So the two men sat down to eat and drink together. Then the woman’s father said
to him, “Please stay another night. Relax/Rest and have a joyful time.”
7 The man from the tribe of Levi wanted to leave, but the woman’s father requested
him to stay one more night. So he stayed again that night.
8 On the fifth day, the man got up early and prepared to leave. But the woman’s
father said to him again, “Have something to eat. Wait until this afternoon, and then
leave.” So the two men ate together.
9 In the afternoon, when the man from the tribe of Levi and his slave wife and his
servant got up to leave, the woman’s father said, “It will soon be dark. The day is
almost over. Stay here tonight and have a good/joyful time. Tomorrow morning you
can get up early and leave for your home.”
10 But the man from the tribe of Levi did not want to stay for another night. He
put saddles on his two donkeys, and started to go with his slave wife and his servant
toward Jebus city, which is now named Jerusalem.
11 Late in the afternoon, they came near to Jebus. The servant said to his master,
“We should stop in this city where the Jebus people-group live, and stay here tonight.”
12 But his master said, “No, it would not be good for us to stay here where foreign
people live. There are no Israeli people here. We will go on to Gibeah city.”
13 He said to his servant, “Let’s go. It is not far to Gibeah. We can go there, or we
can go a bit further to Ramah. We can stay in one of those two cities tonight.”
14 So they continued walking. When they came near Gibeah, where people from
the tribe of Benjamin live, the sun was setting.
15 They stopped to stay there that night. They went to the public square of that city
and sat down. But no one who passed by invited them to stay in their house for that
night.
16 Finally, in the evening, an old man came by. He had been working in the fields.
He was from the hilly area of the tribe of Ephraim, but at that time he was living in
Gibeah.
17 He realized that the man from the tribe of Levi was only traveling and did not
have a home in that city. So he asked the man, “Where have you come from? And
where are you going?”
18 He replied, “We are traveling from Bethlehem to my home in the hilly area where
people of the tribe of Ephraim live. I went from there to Bethlehem, but now we are
going to Shiloh where Yahweh’s Sacred tent (OR, my house) is. No one here has invited
us to stay in their house tonight.
19 We have straw and food for our donkeys, and bread and wine for me and the
young woman and my servant. We do not need anything else.”
20 The old man said, “I wish that things will go well for you, but I would like to
provide what you need. Do not stay here in the square tonight.”
21 Then the old man took them to his house. He gave food to the donkeys. He gave
water to the man and the woman and the servant to wash their feet. And he gave
them something to eat and drink.
JUDGES 19:22
378
JUDGES 20:8
22 While they were having a good/joyful time together, some wicked men from that
city surrounded the house and started to bang on the door. They shouted to the old
man, “Bring out to us the man who has come to your house. We want to have sex
with him.”
23 The old man went outside and said to them, “Friends, I will not do that. That
would be a very evil thing. This man is a guest in my house. You should not do such
a terrible/disgraceful/shameful thing!
24 Look, my daughter is here. She is still a virgin. And this man’s slave wife is here.
I will bring them out to you now. You may do to them whatever you wish, but do not
do such a terrible/disgraceful/shameful thing to this young man!”
Levi took his slave wife and sent her to them, outside the house. They raped [EUP]
26 She returned to the old man’s house, where her husband was staying, but she
27 In the morning, when the man from the tribe of Levi got up, he went outside of
of the house. Her hands were on the doorsill.
He put her body on the donkey and traveled to his home.
29 When he arrived home, he took a knife and cut the body of the slave woman into
twelve pieces. Then he sent one piece to each area of Israel, along with a message
telling what had happened.
30 Everyone who saw a piece of the body and the message said, “Nothing like this
has ever happened before. Not since our ancestors left Egypt have we heard of such
a terrible thing. We need to think carefully about it. Someone should decide what we
should do.”
20
The war between the tribe of Benjamin and the other tribes of Israel
1 All the Israelis, from Dan city in the north to Beersheba city in the south, and even
from the Gilead region on the east side of the Jordan River, heard what had happened.
So they they gathered together at Mizpah, at the place where they worshiped Yahweh.
2 The leaders of eleven of the tribes of Israel stood in front of the people who
gathered there. There were 400,000 men with swords who were there.
3 The people of the tribe of Benjamin heard that the other Israelis had gone up to
Mizpah, but none of the men from their tribe went to the meeting there.
The Israelis who had come to Mizpah asked about the evil thing that had happened.
4 So the husband of the woman who had been killed replied, “My slave wife and I
came to Gibeah city, wanting to stay there that night.
5 That evening, the men of Gibeah came to attack me. They surrounded the house
where I was staying and wanted to have sex with me and then kill me. They raped and
abused my slave wife all night, and she died.
6 I took her body home and cut it into pieces. Then I sent one piece to each area of
Israel, because I wanted you all to know about this wicked and disgraceful/shameful
thing that has been done here in Israel.
7 So now, all you Israeli people, speak, and tell me what you think should be done!”
8 All the people stood up, and in unison said, “None of us will go home! Not one of
us will return to his house!
JUDGES 20:9
379
9 This is what we must do to the people of Gibeah.
JUDGES 20:27-28
First, we will ◄cast lots/throw
marked stones► to determine which group should attack them.
10 We will choose ◄one tenth/one from every ten► of the men from all the Israeli
tribes. Those men will go and find food for the men who will go to attack the people
of Gibeah. Then the other men will go to Gibeah to ◄pay the people back/punish
them► for this terrible thing that they have done here in Israel.”
11 And all the Israeli people agreed that the people of Gibeah should be punished.
12 Then the Israeli men sent messengers throughout the tribe of Benjamin. They
demanded, “Do you realize that some of your men have done a very evil thing?
13 Bring those wicked men to us, in order that we can execute them. By doing that,
we will be doing what should be done because of this evil thing that has happened
in Israel.”
But the people of the tribe of Benjamin did not pay attention to their fellow Israelis.
14 The men of the tribe of Benjamin left their cities and gathered at Gibeah to fight
the other Israelis.
15 In that one day the men of the tribe of Benjamin recruited 26,000 soldiers who
knew how to fight using swords. They also chose/recruited 700 men from Gibeah.
16 From all those soldiers there were 700 men who were left-handed, and each of
them could sling a stone at a target that was very small and as narrow as a hair, and
the stone always hit the target!
17 There were 400,000 men from the other Israeli tribes who had swords.
18 Those other Israelis went up to Bethel and asked God, “Which tribe should be
the first to attack the men from the tribe of Benjamin?”
Yahweh answered, “The men from the tribe of Judah should go first.”
19 The next morning, the Israeli men went and set up their tents near Gibeah.
20 Then they went to fight against the men from the tribe of Benjamin, and stood in
their positions for fighting a battle, facing Gibeah.
21 The men of the tribe of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and fought against them,
and they killed 22,000 Israeli men on that day.
22-23 Late that afternoon, the remaining Israeli men went to the place of worship
and cried until the sun set. Then they asked Yahweh, “Should we attack the men of
the tribe of Benjamin again, even though they are our fellow Israelis?”
Yahweh replied, “Yes, attack them again.” So the Israeli men encouraged each other.
24 The next day they again stood in their positions for fighting, just like they had
done on the previous day.
25 The men of the tribe of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and attacked the Israelis,
and killed 18,000 more of their men.
26 In the afternoon, all the people of Israel who had not been killed again went to
Bethel. There they sat down and cried to Yahweh, and they ◄fasted/abstained from
eating food► until it was evening. They brought some offerings which they burned
completely on the altar, and they also brought some offerings to maintain fellowship
with Yahweh.
27-28 At that time, the Sacred Chest that contained the stone tablets on which were
written the Ten Commandments was there at Bethel. A priest named Phinehas, the
son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron, often stood in front of that chest and talked
with Yahweh. While he stood there on that day, he asked Yahweh, “Shall we go again
to fight against our fellow Israelis from the tribe of Benjamin, or shall we stop fighting
against them?”
Yahweh answered, “Go again tomorrow, because tomorrow I will enable you to
JUDGES 20:46
29 So the next day, 10,000 of the Israeli men ◄set up ambushes/went to hide► in the
fields around Gibeah.
30 The other Israeli men went and stood in their positions for fighting a battle just
like they had done on the previous days.
31 When the men of the tribe of Benjamin came out of the city to fight against them,
the Israeli men retreated away from the city, and the men of the tribe of Benjamin
pursued them. The men of the tribe of Benjamin killed many Israelis, like they had
done before. They killed about 30 Israelis. They killed some in the fields, and they
killed some on the road that went to Bethel and on the road that went to Gibeah.
32 The men of the tribe of Benjamin said, “We are defeating them like we did
before!” But then Israeli men did what they had planned. The main group of Israeli
men retreated a short distance from the city, to trick the men of Gibeah and cause
them to pursue the Israeli men along the roads outside the city.
33 The main group of Israeli men left their positions and retreated, and then they
stood in their battle positions again at a place named Baal-Tamar.
34 Then while the men of Gibeah were running out of the city toward them, the other
10,000 Israelis came out from the places where they had been hiding, west of Gibeah.
They were men who had come from all parts of Israel. There was a very big battle.
But the men of the tribe of Benjamin did not know that they were about to suffer a
disastrous defeat.
35 Yahweh enabled the Israeli men to defeat the men of the tribe of Benjamin. They
killed 25,000 of them, even though they all were using swords.
This is what happened:
36-38 The main group of Israeli men arranged with the men who would be hiding
that they should send up a smoke signal to enable the main group of soldiers to know
when they should attack. Then the main group of Israeli men retreated for a short
distance, because they knew that the other Israeli men who had been hiding on the
other side of Gibeah would attack the people of the tribe of Benjamin by surprise. So
after the main group of Israeli men retreated a little distance, the men who had been
hiding rushed out and ran into Gibeah and used their swords to kill everyone in the
city. Then they started to burn the buildings.
39 By that time, the men of the tribe of Benjamin said, “We are winning the battle,
as we did before!”
40 But then smoke from the burning buildings began to rise up from the city. The
men of the tribe of Benjamin turned around and saw that the whole city was burning.
41 Then the main group of Israeli men also saw the smoke, and they knew that the
smoke signaled that they should turn around and begin to attack. The men of the tribe
of Benjamin were very afraid, because they realized that they were about to suffer a
disastrous defeat.
42 So the men of the tribe of Benjamin tried to run away toward the desert to escape
from the Israeli men, but they were not able to escape, because the Israeli men who
had burned the two cities came out of those cities and killed many of them.
43 They surrounded some of the men of the tribe of Benjamin, and pursued the
others to the area east of Gibeah.
44 They killed 18,000 strong soldiers of the tribe of Benjamin.
45 Then the rest of the men of the tribe of Benjamin realized that they had been
5,000 more men of the tribe of Benjamin along the roads. They pursued the rest of
46 Altogether, there were 25,000 men of the tribe of Benjamin who were killed, all
of whom had swords.
JUDGES 20:47
381
JUDGES 21:16
47 But 600 men of the tribe of Benjamin ran to Rimmon Rock in the desert.
They
stayed there for four months.
48 Then the Israeli men went back to the land belonging to the tribe of Benjamin,
and killed the people in every city. They also killed all the animals, and destroyed
everything else that they found there. And they burned all the cities that they came
to.
21
They found wives for the men of the tribe of Benjamin
1 When the Israeli men gathered at Mizpah before the battle started, they vowed,
“None of us will ever allow one of our daughters to marry any man from the tribe of
Benjamin!”
2 But now the Israelis went to Bethel and they cried loudly to Yahweh all day, until
the sun went down.
3 They kept saying, “Yahweh, God of us Israeli people, it is as though one of the
tribes of us Israelis does not exist any more! ◄Why has this happened to us?/It is
terrible that this has happened to us!►” [RHQ]
4 Early the next morning the people built an altar. Then they completely burned
some sacrifices on the altar, and also offered other sacrifices to maintain fellowship
with God.
5 Then, because they had vowed that anyone who did not meet with them at Mizpah
to help fight the men of the tribe of Benjamin would be killed, they asked among
themselves, “Were there any of the tribes of Israel who did not come to Mizpah to
meet with us in the presence of Yahweh?”
6 The Israelis felt sorry for their fellow Israelis from the tribe of Benjamin. They
said, “Today one of our Israeli tribes ◄has disappeared/no longer exists►.
7 Yahweh heard us solemnly declare that we would not allow any of our daughters
to marry any man from the tribe of Benjamin. What can we do to make certain that
the men of the tribe of Benjamin who were not killed will have wives?”
8 Then one of them asked, “What group from any of the tribes of Israel did not send
any men here to Mizpah?”
9 They realized that when the soldiers were counted, there was no one from JabeshGilead city who had come there.
10 So all the Israelis decided to send 12,000 very good soldiers to Jabesh-Gilead to
kill the people there with their swords, even to kill the married women and children.
11 They told this to those men: “This is what you must do: You must kill every man in
Jabesh-Gilead. You must also kill every married woman. But do not kill the unmarried
12 So those soldiers went to Jabesh-Gilead and killed all the men, married women, and
to their camp at Shiloh, in Canaan, across the river from the Gilead area that belonged
13 Then all the Israelis who had gathered sent a message to the 600 men who were
at Rimmon Rock. They said that they would like to make peace with them.
14 So the men came back from Rimmon Rock. The Israelis gave to them the women
from Jabesh-Gilead whom they had not killed. But there were only 400 women. But
there were not enough women for those 600 men.
15 The Israelis still felt sorry for the men of the tribe of Benjamin, because Yahweh
had ◄decimated/almost wiped out► one of the Israeli tribes.
16 The Israeli leaders said, “We have killed all the married women of the tribe of
Benjamin. Where can we get women to be wives of the men who are still alive?
JUDGES 21:17
382
JUDGES 21:25
17 These men must have wives to give birth to children, in order that their families
will continue. If that does not happen, all the people of one of the tribes of Israel will
die.
18 But we cannot allow our daughters to marry these men, because we vowed that
Yahweh will curse anyone who gives one of his daughters to become a wife of any
man of the tribe of Benjamin.”
19 Then one of them ◄had an idea/thought of something that they could do►. He
said, “Every year there is a festival to honor Yahweh at Shiloh, which is north of
Bethel and east of the road that extends from Bethel to Shechem, and it is south of
Lebonah city.”
20 So the Israeli leaders told the men of the tribe of Benjamin, “When it is the time
for that festival, go to Shiloh and hide in the vineyards.
come out, all of you should run out of the vineyards. Each of you can seize one of the
22 If their fathers or brothers come to us and complain about what you have done,
we will say to them, ‘Be kind to the men of the tribe of Benjamin. When we fought
them, we did not leave any women alive to become their wives, and you did not give
those young women to the men from the tribe of Benjamin. They stole them. So you
will not be guilty, even though you said that you would not allow any of your daughters
to marry one of them.’ ”
23 So that is what the men of the tribe of Benjamin did. They went to Shiloh at the
time of the festival. And when the young women were dancing, each man caught one
of them and took her away and married her. Then they took their wives back to the
land that God had given to them. They rebuilt their cities that had been burned down,
and they lived there.
24 The other Israelis went to their homes in the areas where their tribes and clans
lived, the areas that God had allotted to them.
25 At that time, the Israeli people did not have a king. Everyone did what they
themselves thought was right.
RUTH 1:1
383
RUTH 1:17
This book contains the account of Ruth, a non-Israeli
Ruth
Ruth declared she would stay with Naomi
1 During the time before kings ruled Israel, ◄there was a famine/the people there
had nothing to eat►. There was a man who lived there whose name was Elimelech.
His wife’s name was Naomi, and his sons’ names were Mahlon and Chilion. They
were all from Bethlehem town, from the Ephrath clan in Judah region.
2 Because of the famine, they left Bethlehem and went east to live for a while in
Moab region.
3 While they were there, Elimelech died, and Naomi had only her two sons with
her.
4 They married women from Moab. One of them was named Orpah, and the other
one was named Ruth. But after they had lived in that area for about ten years,
5 Mahlon and Chilion died. So then Naomi had no husband and no sons.
6 One day while Naomi was in Moab, she heard someone say that Yahweh had
helped his people in Israel and that now there was plenty of food to eat. So she
prepared to return to Bethlehem.
7 She left the place where she had been living and started to walk with her
daughters-in-law along the road back to Judah.
8 Then as the three of them were walking, Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law,
“Each of you should turn around and go back to your mother’s home. You treated
your husbands kindly before they died, and you have treated me kindly.
9 Now I desire that Yahweh will enable each of you to have another husband in
whose home you will feel secure.” Then she kissed both of them, and they cried
aloud.
10 They each said, “No, we want to go with you as you return to your relatives.”
11 But Naomi said, “No, my daughters, return home. ◄It will not do any good for
you to come with me!/What good will it do for you to come with me?► [RHQ] Do you
think I will get married again and have more sons who could become your husbands?
12 Even if I thought I could have another husband, and even if I got married today
and became pregnant [EUP] tonight and later gave birth to sons,
13 would you remain single/unmarried until they grew up and became old enough
for you to marry? No, my daughters, you would not do that. Your situations are bad
because your husbands have died, but it is possible that you will each marry again. My
situation is much worse, because Yahweh [SYN] has opposed me, and now I am too
old to get married again.”
14 Then Ruth and Orpah cried again because of what Naomi said. Then Orpah kissed
her mother-in-law goodbye, and left, but Ruth clung to Naomi.
15 Naomi said to her, “Look! Your sister-in-law is going back to her relatives and to
her gods! Go back with her!”
16 But Ruth replied, “No! Don’t urge me to leave you! I want to go with you. Where
you go, I will go. Where you stay, I will stay. Your relatives will be my relatives, and
the God you worship will be the God I worship.
17 Where you die, I will die. Where you are buried, I will be buried. May Yahweh
punish me severely if I separate from you. I will be separated from you only when
one of us dies.”
RUTH 1:18
urging her to return home.
19 So the two women continued walking until they came to Bethlehem. When they
arrived there, everyone in town was excited to see them. The women of the town
exclaimed, “◄Can this be Naomi?/It is difficult to believe that this is Naomi!►” [RHQ]
20 Naomi said to them, “Don’t call me Naomi, which means ‘pleasant’. Instead,
call me Mara, which means ‘bitter’, because God Almighty has made my life very
unpleasant.
21 When I left here, I felt rich, because I had a family. But Yahweh has brought
me back here and now I feel poor, because I have no family. Do not call me Naomi
[RHQ]. I feel as though Yahweh has spoken against (OR, afflicted) me. Almighty God
has caused me to experience a great tragedy.”
22 That summarizes the account of Naomi returning home along with her daughterin-law Ruth, the woman from Moab. And it happened that when they arrived in
Bethlehem, the barley grain harvest was just beginning.
2
Ruth met Boaz
1 There was a man in Bethlehem who belonged to the clan of Naomi’s dead husband,
Elimelech. He was rich and well-known/influential. His name was Boaz.
2 One day Ruth said to Naomi, “Let me go to the fields and pick up the grain left
behind by the workers.” Naomi replied, “Go ahead, my daughter.”
3 So Ruth went to the fields and began to pick up some of the left-over grain. And
it happened that she was working in a field that belonged to Boaz, the man from the
clan of her dead father-in-law, Elimelech!
4 Just then, Boaz arrived from Bethlehem. He greeted the men who were harvesting
the grain, saying, “I want Yahweh to bless you!” They replied, “We want Yahweh to
bless you, too!”
5 Then Boaz saw Ruth, and asked the ◄foreman/ man in charge of the other
workmen►, “Whose daughter is that young woman?”
6 The foreman replied, “She is the woman from Moab who returned from there
with her mother-in-law Naomi.
7 She said to me, ‘Please let me walk behind the men who are harvesting the grain
and pick up some of the grain they leave behind.’ I gave her permission, and she went
into the field, and she has been working from this morning until now. The only time
she did not work was when she rested for a short time in the shelter.”
8 So Boaz went over to Ruth and said to her, “Young lady, listen to me. Don’t go and
pick up grain in another field. Do not go away from here. Stay here with my servant
girls.
9 Watch where the men are harvesting, and follow along behind the servant girls.
I will tell the men who are working not to touch/molest you. And whenever you are
thirsty, go and get some water to drink from the jars that the men have filled.”
10 When he said that, she knelt down in front of him in respect, with her face
touching the ground. She exclaimed, “Why are you acting so kindly toward me, by
paying attention to me? I am not even a Jew; I am a foreigner!”
11 Boaz replied, “People have told me all about what you have done for your motherin-law. They told me that you left your parents and your homeland, and you came
RUTH 3:3
12 I hope/desire that Yahweh will repay you for what you have done. You have put
yourself in the care of Yahweh, like a little bird puts itself under its mother’s wings
[MET]. I desire that he will reward you very greatly.”
13 She replied, “Sir, I hope you will continue to act kindly toward me. You have
comforted/encouraged me, even though I am lower in status than any of your servant
girls.”
14 At mealtime, Boaz said to her, “Come over here. Take some bread and dip it in
the wine vinegar and eat it.” Then when she sat down with the men who had been
harvesting, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all the grain she wanted, and
had some left over.
15 As she stood up to start gathering grain again, Boaz ordered his workers, “Even
if she gathers some grain near the bundles of grain that have been cut, do not scold
her.
16 Instead, pull out some stalks of grain from the bundles, and leave them on the
ground for her to pick up, and do not rebuke her.”
17 So Ruth gathered grain in the field until evening. Then she ◄threshed/beat with
a stick► the barley that she had gathered, to separate the kernels from the stalks, and
the barley filled a large basket.
18 She carried it back to town, and showed to her mother-in-law how much she had
gathered. Ruth also showed to her the grain that was left over after she had eaten
enough from what Boaz had given her at lunchtime.
19 Her mother-in-law asked her, “Where did you gather grain today? In whose field
did you work? God will surely bless the man who was kind to you.” Then Ruth told
her about the man in whose field she had been working. She said, “The name of the
man who owns the field where I worked today is Boaz.”
20 Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “I hope/desire that Yahweh will bless him!
He has not stopped acting kindly toward us, who are still living, and to our husbands
who have died.” Then she added, “That man is a close relative of Elimelech; he is one
of those who has a responsibility to help those who are his relatives.”
21 Then Ruth said, “He also said to me, ‘Stay with my workers until they have
finished harvesting all my grain.’ ”
22 Naomi replied, “My daughter, it will be good for you to go to his field with his
servant girls, because if you go to someone else’s field, someone might harm/molest
you.”
23 So Ruth stayed close to Boaz’s servant girls while she was working. She gathered
stalks of grain until the barley harvest and the wheat harvest were finished. During
that time she lived with Naomi.
3
Ruth asked Boaz to marry her so she would have a home and other things she needed
1 One day, Naomi said to Ruth, “My daughter, I think that I should [RHQ] try to
arrange for you to have a husband [MTY] who will ◄take care of/provide for► you.
2 Boaz, the man with whose servant girls you have been gathering grain, is a close
relative of our dead husbands. Listen carefully. Tonight he will be at the ground where
3 Bathe yourself and put on some perfume. Put on your best clothes. Then go down
are there while he is eating supper and drinking.
RUTH 3:4
386
RUTH 4:1
4 When he has finished eating, notice where he lies down to sleep. Then when he is
asleep, take the blanket off his feet and lie close to his feet. When he wakes up, he will
tell you what to do.”
5 Ruth replied, “I will do everything that you have told me to do.”
6 So she went down to the ground where they had threshed the barley grain. There
she did everything that her mother-in-law had told her to do.
7 When Boaz finished eating supper and drinking wine, he felt happy. Then he went
over to the far end of the pile of grain. He lay down and went to sleep. Then Ruth
approached him quietly. She took the blanket off his feet and lay down there.
8 In the middle of the night, he suddenly awoke. He sat up and saw that a woman
was lying at his feet.
9 He asked her, “Who are you?” She replied, “I am your servant, Ruth. Since you are
the one who has a responsibility to take care of someone like me whose dead husband
was your close relative, spread the corner of your cloak over my feet to show that
you will marry me.”
10 Boaz replied, “Young lady, I hope that Yahweh will ◄bless/be kind to► you! You
have acted kindly toward your mother-in-law, and now you are acting even more
kindly toward me by wanting to marry me, instead of wanting to marry a young man.
You have not looked for either a rich young man or a poor young man, to marry him.
11 Now, young lady, I will do everything you ask. Don’t worry that people in this
town might think I am doing wrong by marrying you because you are a woman from
Moab. All the people in this town know that you are an honorable woman.
12 But there is one problem. Although it is true that I am a close relative of your
mother-in-law’s dead husband, there is another man who is a closer relative than I
am, and therefore he should be the one to marry you and take care of you.
13 You stay here for the rest of this night. Tomorrow morning I will tell this man
about you. If he says that he will marry you and take care of you, fine, we will let him
do that. But if he is not willing to do that, I solemnly promise that as surely as Yahweh
lives, I will marry you and take care of you. So lie/sleep here until it is morning.”
14 So she lay at his feet until morning. But she got up and left before it was light
enough that people would be able to recognize her, because Boaz said, “I do not want
anyone to know that a woman was here.”
15 He also said to her, “Bring to me your cloak and spread it out.” When she did
that, he poured into it six measures/24 liters/50 pounds of barley, and put in on her
back. Then he (OR, she) went back to the town.
16 When Ruth arrived home, her mother-in-law asked her, “My daughter, how did
done for her and said to her.
return to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’ ”
that Boaz will take care of [LIT] the matter of your marriage today. [LIT]”

Boaz married Ruth
1 Meanwhile, Boaz went up to the town gate and sat there.
That was the place
where people met together to decide important matters. When the man that Boaz had
mentioned came there, the close relative of Ruth and Naomi’s dead husbands who
had a responsibility to take care of Naomi and Ruth, Boaz said to him, “My friend,
come over here and sit down.” So the man went and sat down.
RUTH 4:2
387
RUTH 4:16
2 Boaz then gathered ten of the elders of the town and asked them to sit down there
also. After they sat down,
3 he said to the man who had the responsibility to take care of Naomi, “Naomi has
returned from Moab region. She wants to sell the field that belonged to our relative
Elimelech.
4 I thought that I should tell you about that, and suggest that you buy it, while these
elders who are sitting here are listening. If you are willing to buy the property, do
that. But if you do not want to buy it, tell me, so that I will know. I am suggesting
this to you because you are the one who has the first right to buy it, and I am the one
who has the second/next right to buy it.” The man replied, “I will buy it!”
5 Then Boaz told him, “When you buy the land from Naomi, you will also be taking
Ruth, the woman who is from Moab, to be your wife, in order that she may give birth
to a son who will inherit the property of her dead husband [MTY].”
6 Then the close relative of Ruth’s dead husband said, “If that is so, I do not want to
buy the field, because then my own children would not inherit the property; Ruth’s
children would inherit it. You buy the property!”
7 At that time, it was the custom in Israel, when a person bought property that
belonged to another person, that the man who was selling the property would take
off one of his sandals and give it to the one who was buying the property. That was
the way they finalized sales in Israel.
8 So that close relative said to Boaz, “You buy the field yourself!” And he took off
one of his sandals and gave it to Boaz.
9 Then Boaz said to the elders and all the other people who were there, “Today you
have all seen that I have bought from Naomi all the property that belonged to her
dead husband Elimelech and his dead sons Mahlon and Chilion.
10 I am also taking Ruth, the woman from Moab, Mahlon’s widow, to be my wife,
in order that she may give birth to a son who will inherit the property of the dead
man. In that way, Elimelech’s name will continue [LIT] among the members of his
family and among all the people of this town. Today you all are witnesses of what I
have done.”
11 All the elders and the others who were sitting at the town gate agreed, and one
woman, who will be coming into your home, to give birth to many children, as Rachel
descended. We hope that you will become rich in the clan of Ephratah, and become
12 We hope/desire that Yahweh will enable you and this young woman to have many
of your ancestor Perez, the son of Judah and Tamar.”
13 So Boaz took Ruth home, and she became his wife.
He ◄slept with/had sexual
relations with► her [EUP] and Yahweh enabled her to become pregnant, and she gave
birth to a son.
14 The women of Bethlehem said to Naomi, “Praise Yahweh! Now he has given [LIT]
you a grandson who will be the one who will have the responsibility to take care of
you. We hope that he will become famous [MTY] throughout Israel.
15 He will make you feel young again, and he will take care of you when you become
old. Your daughter-in-law, who loves you, has given birth to a son, who will ◄be better
to/do more for► you than if you had seven sons of your own.”
16 Then Naomi took the baby and put him on her lap, and took care of him.
RUTH 4:17
388
RUTH 4:18-22
17 The women who were living near her said, “It is as though Naomi now has a
son!” And they named him Obed. Later, Obed became the father of Jesse, and later
Jesse became the father of King David.
18-22 Here is a list of the ancestors of King David: Perez’s son was Hezron. Hezron’s
son was Ram. Ram’s son was Amminadab. Amminadab’s son was Nahshon.
Nahshon’s son was Salmon. Salmon’s son was Boaz. Boaz’s son was Obed. Obed’s
son was Jesse. Jesse’s son was King David.
1 SAMUEL 1:1
389
1 SAMUEL 1:16
This book contains the account of what happened in
Israel from the birth of Samuel to the death of King Saul.
We call this book
1 Samuel
Samuel was born
1 There was a man named Elkanah who lived in Ramah town in the hilly area where
the tribe of Ephraim lived. His father was Jeroham, his grandfather was Elihu, and
his great-grandfather was Tohu. He belonged to the Zuph clan.
2 He had two wives: Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had several children, but
Hannah had no children.
3 Once every year Elkanah went up with his family from Ramah to Shiloh city. He
sacrifices to him. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, helped their father to do
4 Each time Elkanah offered sacrifices there, he gave some of the meat to Peninnah
and some to each of her sons and daughters.
5 But even though he loved Hannah very much, he gave her only one special amount
of meat because Yahweh had not permitted her to give birth to any children.
6 And his other wife, Peninnah, would ridicule Hannah to make her feel miserable,
because Yahweh had not allowed her to bear children.
7 This happened every year. When they went up to the temple of Yahweh at Shiloh,
Peninnah ridiculed Hannah so much that Hannah cried and would not eat.
8 Then Elkanah would say to her, “Hannah, ◄why are you crying?/please quit
crying!► [RHQ] ◄Why are you not eating?/Please eat something!► [RHQ] Why are
you so upset/sad? You have me; is that not more important to you than if you had
ten sons? (OR, I love you more than your sons would love you, even if you had ten
sons.)”
9 One year, after they had finished eating and drinking at Shiloh, Hannah stood up
to pray. Eli the priest was nearby, sitting on a chair by the doorway of the sacred tent
of Yahweh.
10 Hannah was very distressed, and she cried very sorrowfully as she prayed to
Yahweh.
11 She made a vow saying, “O Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, if you
will look at me and see how miserable I am, and think about me and allow me to
give birth to a son, then I will dedicate him to you to serve you for the rest of his life.
And to show that he is dedicated to you, ◄no one will ever be allowed to cut his hair/
his hair will never be cut►.”
12 As she was praying like that to Yahweh, Eli the priest saw Hannah’s lips moving
as she was praying.
13 But Hannah was only praying silently; she was not making any sound. So Eli
thought that she was drunk.
14 He said to her, “How long will you continue to get drunk [RHQ]? ◄Throw away
your wine/Quit drinking wine►!”
15 Hannah replied, “Sir, I am not drunk! I have not been drinking wine or any other
alcoholic drink. I feel very distressed and I have been telling Yahweh about how I
feel.
16 Do not think that I am a worthless/wicked woman! I have been praying like this
because I am very distressed [DOU].”
1 SAMUEL 1:17
390
1 SAMUEL 2:4
17 Eli replied, “I wish/desire that things will go well for you. I desire that God, the
one we Israeli people worship, will give you what you requested from him.”
18 She replied, “I want you to think highly/well about me.” Then she returned to
her family and after she ate something, her face no longer looked sad.
19 Early the next morning, Elkanah and his family got up and worshiped Yahweh
again, and then they returned to their home at Ramah. Elkanah ◄slept with/had sex
with► Hannah. Then Yahweh answered her prayer,
20 and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, which
sounds like the words in the Hebrew language that mean ‘heard by God’, because she
said “Yahweh heard me when I requested from him a son.”
Hannah dedicated Samuel to Yahweh
21 The following year, Elkanah again went up to Shiloh with his family to make the
had promised to give him previously.
the baby, I will take him to Shiloh and present him to Yahweh, and he will stay there
23 Elkanah said, “Do what seems the best to you. Stay here until you have weaned
him. What I desire is that Yahweh will enable you to do what you have promised.”
So Hannah stayed at home and nursed her son until she weaned him.
24 After she weaned him, even though Samuel was very young, she took him to the
temple/house of Yahweh at Shiloh. To offer as a sacrifice, she took along a three-yearold bull, a sack containing ◄20 pounds/9 kg.► of flour, and a container of wine.
25 After the priest had slaughtered the bull and offered it to Yahweh on the altar,
Hannah and Elkanah brought the boy to Eli.
26 Then Hannah said to him, “Sir, ◄Do you remember me?/I solemnly affirm►, I am
the woman who prayed as I stood here beside you several years ago.
27 I prayed that Yahweh would enable me to give birth to a child, and this is the
child whom I requested Yahweh to give me.
28 So now I am presenting him to Yahweh. He will belong to Yahweh as long as he
lives.” Then Elkanah and his family worshiped Yahweh there.
1 Then Hannah prayed, saying,

“I rejoice in what you, Yahweh, have done.
I am strong [MET] because I belong to you.
I ◄laugh at/ridicule► my enemies,
because you, Yahweh have rescued me from being taunted by them.
2 There is no one who is holy like you, Yahweh.
There is no other god like you.
There is no one like you, our God, who can protect us as though you were putting
us beneath a huge rock where we can hide from danger.
3 You people who oppose God, stop boasting!
Yahweh is a God who knows everything,
and he will evaluate/judge everyone’s actions.
So don’t speak so arrogantly!
4 Yahweh, you break the bows/weapons of mighty soldiers,

1 SAMUEL 2:16
and you give strength to those who stumble because of being weak.

you cause them to become healthy again.
7 Yahweh, you cause some people to be poor and you cause some people to be rich,
you humble some people and you honor some people.
8 Sometimes you lift poor people up so that they are no longer despondent, sitting in
the dust,
or sitting on heaps of ashes;
you cause them to sit next to princes;
you cause them to sit on chairs/thrones where people who are highly honored
sit.
Yahweh, you are the one who laid the foundations of the earth,
and you have set the whole world on those foundations.
9 You will protect your loyal/faithful people [SYN],
but you will cause the wicked to die [EUP] and descend to the dark place where dead
people are.
We do not defeat our enemies by our own strength;
10 Yahweh, you will break into pieces those who oppose you.
You will cause thunder in the sky to show that you ◄oppose/are angry with►
them.
Yahweh, you will judge people everywhere, even those who live in the most remote
places on the earth.
You will give strength to the king whom you will appoint, and give him great
power over his enemies.”
11 Then Elkanah and his family returned to Ramah, but Samuel, the little boy, stayed
to help Eli the priest serve Yahweh.
Eli’s sons were wicked
12 Eli’s two sons, who were also priests, were very wicked. They did not revere (OR,
respect/obey) Yahweh.
13 While the people were boiling the meat from their sacrifices in the huge pot at
the temple, one of Eli’s sons, would send his servant to come with a large three-pronged
fork in his hand.
14 He would stick the fork into the meat in the pot, and whatever meat fastened
onto the fork, he would take and give it to the priest who sent him. Eli’s sons did this
to all the Israeli people who came to Shiloh to offer sacrifices.
15 Furthermore, before the fat on the meat was cut off and and burned as a sacrifice
to Yahweh, the servant of the priest would sometimes come to the man who was
making the sacrifice and say to him, “Give me some meat now to take to the priest
for him to roast! He wants raw meat; he does not want boiled meat.”
16 If the man said to the servant, “Let the priests cut off and burn the fat first; then
you can take what you want,” the servant would reply, “No, give it to me now; if you
do not give it to me, I will take it forcefully!”
1 SAMUEL 2:17
392
1 SAMUEL 2:32
17 Yahweh considered that the young sons of Eli were committing a very great sin,
because they were treating very disrespectfully the offerings that were being given
18 As for Samuel, who was still a very young boy, he continued to do work for
19 Each year his mother made a new little robe for him and took it to him when she
20 Then Eli would ask God to bless Elkanah and his wife, and he would say to
Elkanah, “I hope/desire that Yahweh will enable your wife to give birth to other
children, to take the place of the one whom she dedicated to Yahweh.” Then Elkanah
and his family would return home.
21 And Yahweh was very kind to Hannah, and enabled her to give birth to three
other sons and two daughters. Their son Samuel grew up while he was doing work
for Yahweh in the Sacred Tent.
Eli warned his sons
22 Eli became very old. He often heard about all the evil things that his sons were
doing to the Israeli people. He heard that they sometimes ◄slept with/had sex with►
the women who worked at the entrance to the tent where God spoke to his people.
23 He said to them, “◄It is terrible that you do such things!/Why do you do such
things?► [RHQ] Many people keep telling me about the evil things that you do.
24 My sons, stop it! The reports about you that the people who belong to Yahweh
tell others are terrible [EUP]!
25 If one person sins against another person, God can ◄intercede/act as a referee►
between them. But if someone sins against Yahweh, no one can [RHQ] ◄intercede/
act as a referee► between them!” But Eli’s sons would not listen to what their father
said. This was because Yahweh had decided that someone should kill them.
A prophet warned what would happen to Eli and his family
26 The boy Samuel continued to grow up, and the things that he did pleased Yahweh
and the people.
27 One day, a prophet came to Eli and told him, “This is what Yahweh has told me:
‘When your ancestors were slaves of the king of Egypt, I appeared to Aaron.
28 From all the tribes of the Israeli people, I chose him and his male descendants to
be priests for me. I appointed them to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear
a sacred apron as they worked for me. And I declared that they could take and eat
some of the meat that the Israeli people burned on the altar.
29 So why do you show disrespect for the sacrifices and offerings that I commanded
the people to bring to me [RHQ]? You are honoring your sons more than you are
honoring me, by allowing them to get fat from eating the best parts of all the sacrifices
that the Israeli people bring to me!’
30 “Therefore, this is what Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship, declares: ‘I
definitely promised that Aaron and his descendants would continue to serve [IDM]
me forever.’ But now I declare this: ‘It will not continue like that! I will honor those
who honor me, but I will despise those who despise me.
31 Listen carefully! There will soon be a time when I will cause all the strong young
men in your family to die. The result will be that no men in your family will live long
enough to become old men.
32 You will be distressed and envious as you see the blessings that I will give to the
other people in Israel. And I repeat that no men in your family will ever live long
enough to become old men.
1 SAMUEL 2:33
393
1 SAMUEL 3:16
33 There is one of your descendants whom I will spare, and not prevent him from
serving me as a priest. But he will become blind, and then he will always be sad and
grieving. But all your other descendants will die violently.
34 And your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will both die on the same day. And
that will prove to you that all that I have said will come true/happen.
35 ‘ have chosen another man to be my priest. He is one who will serve me faithfully:
He will do everything I want [DOU] him to do. And I will enable him to have many
descendants [IDM] who will be priests and will always serve me by helping the king
whom I will choose.
36 All of your descendants who remain alive will have to go to that priest and ask
him to give them money and food, and they will each have to say, “Please allow me
to help the other priests, in order that I may earn some money to buy some food.” ’ ”
Yahweh Called Samuel
3
1 While he was still a boy, Samuel was working for Yahweh while Eli supervised
him. At that time there were very few messages that anyone received from Yahweh,
and very few people saw visions that Yahweh gave them.
2 By that time Eli’s eyes were very weak; he was almost blind. One night he was
sleeping in his room,
3 and Samuel was sleeping in the sacred tent, where the chest that contained the
Ten Commandments was kept. While the sacred lamp was still burning,
5 Then he got up and ran to Eli. He said to him, “I am here, because you called me!”
lay down again.
said, “I am here, because you called me!” But Eli said, “No, my son, I did not call you.
Go back and lie down.”
7 At that time Samuel did not yet know that Yahweh could speak to him, because
Yahweh had not previously revealed anything to him.
8 After Samuel lay down again, Yahweh called him a third time. So again Samuel
got up and went to Eli and said, “I am here, because you called me!”
Then Eli realized that it was Yahweh who was calling the boy.
9 So he said to Samuel, “Go and lie down again. If someone calls you again, say
‘Speak to me, Yahweh, because I am listening!’ ” So Samuel went and lay down again.
10 Then Yahweh came and stood there and called as he had done the other times,
“Samuel! Samuel!” Then Samuel said, “Speak to me, because I am listening!”
11 Then Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen carefully. I am about to do something here
in Israel that will shock/horrify [IDM] everyone who hears about it.
12 When that happens, I will punish Eli and his family. I will do to them everything
that I said that I would do.
13 His sons have shown great disrespect for me by the disgraceful things they have
done, and Eli did not restrain them. So I told him that I would punish his family
forever.
14 I solemnly promised to Eli’s family, ‘You will never be able to avoid the
consequences for your sin, even if you give me sacrifices or offerings.’ ”
15 Samuel lay down again until morning. Then he got up and opened the doors of
the Sacred Tent as usual. He was afraid to tell Eli about the vision that Yahweh had
given him.
16 But Eli called him and said, “Samuel, my son!” Samuel answered, “I am here!”
1 SAMUEL 3:17
394
1 SAMUEL 4:11
17 Eli asked him, “What was it that Yahweh told you? Do not conceal it! I want God
to punish you severely if you do not tell me everything that he said to you.”
18 So Samuel told him everything. He did not refuse to tell him anything. Then Eli
said, “He is Yahweh. I am willing for him to do what he thinks is best.”
19 As Samuel grew up, Yahweh helped him, and caused everything to ◄come true/
happen► that Samuel predicted.
20 So all the people of Israel, from the northern end of the country to the southern
end, realized that Samuel was truly a prophet of Yahweh.
21 Yahweh continued to appear to Samuel in Shiloh and give messages to him.
4
1 And Samuel told to all the people of Israel the messages that God gave him.
The Philistines captured the sacred chest
At that time the Israeli army went to fight against the army of the Philistine people.
The Israeli army set up their tents at Ebenezer, and the Philistine army set up their
2 The Philistine army attacked the Israeli army, and as the battle continued, the
3 When the remaining Israeli soldiers returned to their camp, the Israeli elders/
should bring the chest that contains the Ten Commandments here from Shiloh, in
order that Yahweh will go with us when we go to the battle again, and in order that
our enemies will not defeat us again!”
4 So the soldiers did that. They sent some men to Shiloh, and those men brought
back the chest that contained the Ten Commandments. They thought that if they did
that, Yahweh would help them. They believed that Yahweh sat on a throne between
the statues of winged creatures that were on top of the chest that Yahweh Almighty
had given them. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, went with them.
5 When the Israeli people saw the men bringing the box into their camp, they were
so happy that they shouted loudly. They shouted so loudly that they made the ground
shake!
6 The Philistines asked, “What are the people in the Hebrew camp shouting about?”
Someone told them that they were shouting because the chest that contained the Ten
Commandments of Yahweh had been brought to them.
7 Then the Philistines became very afraid. They said, “One of the Israelis’ gods has
come into their camp to help them We are in big trouble now! Nothing like this has
happened to us before!
8 ◄Who can/Can anyone► save us from their powerful gods [RHQ]? They are the
gods who struck the people of Egypt with many plagues before the Israelis left Egypt
and traveled through the desert.
9 You Philistine men, be courageous! Fight very hard! If you do not do that, they
will defeat us, and then you will become their slaves, just like they have been our
slaves previously!”
10 So the Philistine men fought very hard, and they defeated the Israelis. They killed
30,000 Israeli soldiers, and the other Israeli soldiers fled and ran away to their tents.
11 The Philistines captured the sacred chest, and they killed Eli’s two sons, Hophni
and Phinehas.
Eli died
1 SAMUEL 4:12
395
1 SAMUEL 5:7
12 On that same day, one man of the tribe descended from Benjamin tore his clothes
and threw dirt on his head to show that he was very sad. He ran from the place where
the armies were fighting, and he arrived at Shiloh late that afternoon.
13 Eli was waiting beside the road. He wanted to hear news about the battle, and he
was also very anxious to know if anything bad had happened to God’s sacred chest.
When the messenger arrived and told people what had happened, everyone in the
town started to cry loudly.
14 Eli asked, “Why are they making all that noise?” The messenger ran over to Eli
and told him the news.
15 At that time, Eli was 98 years old, and he was blind.
16 The messenger said to Eli, “I have just come from where the armies were fighting.
I left there earlier today.” Eli asked, “What happened?”
17 The man replied, “The Philistines defeated our Israeli army.
thousands of our soldiers, and the others ran away. The Philistines killed your two
18 Eli was very old, and he was very fat; and when he heard what had happened to
broken and he died. He had led the Israeli people for 40 years before he died.
19 The wife/widow of Eli’s son Phinehas was pregnant, and it was almost time for
her to give birth to her baby. When she heard that God’s sacred chest had been
captured and that her husband and her father-in-law were dead, her labor pains
suddenly began. She quickly gave birth to a boy.
20 The women who were helping her tried to encourage her by saying to her, “You
have given birth to a son!” But she did not pay any attention [DOU] to what they said.
21 She named the boy Ichabod, which means ‘no glory’, because she said, “God’s
glory has departed from Israel.” She said that because God’s sacred chest had been
captured and because her husband and her father-in-law had died.
22 She said, “God’s glory has left Israel, because God’s sacred chest has been
captured!” And then she died.
5
What happened when the sacred chest stayed among the Philistines
the army of the Philistia people-group captured God’s sacred chest in
Ebenezer town, they took it to Ashdod which is one of their biggest cities.
2 They carried it into the temple of their god Dagon, and placed it alongside a statue
of Dagon.
3 But early the next morning, when the people of Ashdod went to see it, they saw
that the statue had fallen on its face in front of Yahweh’s sacred chest! So they set
the statue up in its place again.
4 But the following morning, they saw that it had fallen down in front of the sacred
chest again. But this time, the statue’s head and hands had broken off, and were
lying in the doorway. Only its body remained intact/unbroken.
5 That is the reason that since that time, the priests of Dagon and everyone else who
enters the temple of Dagon in Ashdod do not step on the doorsill where the hands and
head of Dagon fell.
6 Then Yahweh [SYN] powerfully caused the people of Ashdod and the people who
lived in nearby villages to have ◄a very great plague/serious illness► of tumors.
7 The men of Ashdod realized why this was happening, and they cried out, “The
god of the Israeli people is punishing us and is also punishing our god Dagon. So we
cannot allow the sacred chest of the god of the Israelis to remain here!”
1 After
1 SAMUEL 5:8
396
1 SAMUEL 6:9
8 They summoned the five kings of the Philistia people-group, and asked them,
“What should we do with the sacred chest of the god of the Israelis?”
The kings replied, “Take the sacred chest to Gath city.” So they moved it to Gath.
9 But after they took it to Gath, Yahweh powerfully struck the people of that city
also, with the result that many men, including young men and old men, got tumors
on their skin. Then the people became very afraid.
10 So they took the sacred chest to Ekron city.
But when the men carried the sacred chest into Ekron, the people there cried out,
“Why are you bringing the sacred chest of the God of the Israelis into our city [RHQ]?
By doing that you will cause us and the rest of our people to die!”
11 The people were terrified/in panic because they knew that God was starting to
punish them severely. So they summoned the five kings of the Philistia people-group
back to its own place! If you do not do that quickly, we will all die!”
suffering because of tumors on their skin. So they all cried out to their gods [MTY]
to help them.
6
They returned the sacred chest to the Israelis
1 The people of Philistia kept God’s sacred chest in their area for seven months.
2 Then they summoned their priests and their ◄diviners/men who practice rituals
to find out what would happen in the future►. They asked them, “What should we
do with the sacred chest of Yahweh? Tell us how we should send it back to its own
land.”
3 Those men replied, “Send with it an offering to show Yahweh that you know that
you are guilty for having captured the chest, in order that the plague will stop. If you
do that, and then if you are healed, you will know that Yahweh is the one who caused
you to experience the plague.”
4 The people of Philistia asked, “What kind of offering should we send?”
The men replied, “Make five gold models of the tumors on your skin, and five gold
models of rats. Make five of each because that is the same number as the number of
your kings, and because the plague has struck both you people and your five kings.
5 Make models that represent the rats and the tumors that are ruining your land.
Make them in order to honor the god of the Israeli people. If you do that, perhaps he
will stop punishing [IDM] you, and your gods, and your land.
6 Do not be [RHQ] stubborn [IDM] like the Egyptians and their king were. They did
not do what the Israelis’ god told them to do, so he punished them. After the Israelis’
god finished punishing them very severely, they were glad to allow the Israelis to
leave their country [RHQ].
7 “So you must build a new cart. Then get two cows that have very recently given
birth to calves. They must be cows that have never been hitched to a cart [MTY].
Hitch those cows to the new cart, and take the calves away from their mothers.
8 Put the Israelis’ god’s sacred chest on the cart. Also put in the cart the five gold
models of the tumors on your skin and the five gold models of rats. Put them in a
small box alongside the sacred chest. They will be an offering to show that you know
that you deserved to be punished for capturing the sacred chest. Then send the cows
down the road, pulling the cart.
9 Watch the cart as the cows pull it. If they pull it to Beth-Shemesh town in Israel,
we will know that it was the Israelis’ god who caused us to experience this plague.
1 SAMUEL 6:10
397
1 SAMUEL 7:3
But if they do not take it there, we will know that it was not the god [MTY] of the
Israelis who has punished us. We will know that it just happened.”
10 So the people did what the priests and men who predicted what would happen
in the future told them to do. They made a cart and hitched two cows to it. They took
the calves from their mothers.
11 They put in the cart Yahweh’s sacred chest and the box with the models of the
gold rats and the tumors.
They stayed on the road, and were mooing all the time. They did not turn to the
reached the edge of Beth-Shemesh.
outside the city. When the cows came along the road, they looked up and saw the
sacred chest. They were extremely happy to see it.
14-15 The cows pulled the cart into the field of a man named Joshua, and they stopped
alongside a large rock. Several men from the tribe of Levi lifted from the cart the
sacred chest and the box containing the gold models of the rats and the tumors, and
they put them all on the large rock. Then the people smashed the cart and kindled
a fire with the wood from which the cart had been made. They slaughtered the cows
and burned their bodies/carcasses on the fire to be an offering for Yahweh that would
be completely burned. That day the people of Beth-Shemesh offered to Yahweh many
sacrifices that were completely burned, and other sacrifices.
16 The five kings from the Philistia area watched all this, and then they returned to
Ekron, that same day.
17 The five gold models of tumors that they sent to be an offering to Yahweh to show
that they knew that they deserved to be punished were gifts from those five kings who
were rulers of Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron cities.
18 The models of the five gold rats were gifts from the people of those five cities
and the surrounding towns. The large rock at Beth-Shemesh, on which the men of
the tribe of Levi set the sacred chest, is still there in the field that belonged to Joshua.
When people see it, they remember what happened there.
19 But seventy men from Beth-Shemesh looked into Yahweh’s sacred chest, and
because of that, Yahweh caused them to die. Then the people mourned very much
because Yahweh punished [IDM] those men like that.
20 They said, “No one [RHQ] can ◄resist the power of/stand in the presence of►
Yahweh, our holy God, and remain alive! Where can we send the sacred chest?”
21 They sent messengers to the people of Kiriath-Jearim city to tell them, “The people
of Philistia have returned Yahweh’s sacred chest to us! Come here and take it away!”
7
1 When the men of Kiriath-Jearim received that message, they came to Beth-Shemesh
was on a hillside. They appointed Abinadab’s son Eleazar to take care of the chest.
2 The sacred chest stayed in Kiriath-Jearim for a long time—a total of 20 years.
abandoned them (OR, and then they asked Yahweh to help them).
3 Then Samuel said to all the Israeli people, “If you truly [IDM] want to act like
Yahweh’s people should, you must get rid of your statues of the goddess Astarte and
the idols/statues of all the other foreign gods. You must decide to serve/worship only
1 SAMUEL 7:4
398
1 SAMUEL 8:1
Yahweh. If you do that, he will rescue you from the power of [MTY] the Philistia
people.”
4 So the Israelis got rid of all their statues of the gods Baal and Astarte, and they
5 Then Samuel told them, “All you Israeli people must gather with me at Mizpah.
6 So they gathered at Mizpah, which was the town where Samuel previously was
the leader of the Israeli people. They had a big ceremony there. They drew water
from a well, and poured the water on the ground while Yahweh watched. To show
that they were sorry for having worshiped idols, they did not eat any food on that day,
and they confessed that they had sinned against Yahweh.
7 When the kings of the Philistia area heard that the Israeli people had gathered
at Mizpah, they led their armies there to attack the Israelis. When the Israelis found
out that the Philistia army was approaching them, they became very afraid.
8 They told Samuel, “Pray to Yahweh to rescue us from the Philistia army [MTY],
and do not stop pleading!”
9 So Samuel took a very young lamb and killed it and offered it to Yahweh to be a
sacrifice that was completely burned on the altar. Then he prayed and pleaded that
Yahweh would help the Israelis, and Yahweh did help them.
10 While Samuel was burning the offering, the Philistia army came near to attack
the Israelis. But Yahweh caused it to thunder very loudly. The soldiers of the Philistia
army became very frightened, and then they ◄became confused/did not know what
to do►. So the Israelis were able to defeat them.
11 The Israeli men ran out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistia soldiers almost to
Beth-Car town, and killed many Philistia soldiers while they were trying to run away.
12 After that happened, Samuel took a large stone and set it up between Mizpah
and Jeshanah towns. He named the stone ‘Ebenezer’, which means ‘stone of help’,
because he said “Yahweh has helped us until the present time.”
13 So the Philistia people were defeated, and for a long time they did not enter the
Israeli land to attack them again. During the time that Samuel was alive, Yahweh
powerfully protected [MTY] the Israeli people from being attacked by the Philistia
army.
14 The Israeli army was able to capture again the Israeli villages between Ekron
and Gath that the Philistia army had captured before. The Israelis were also able
to take again the other areas around those cities that the Philistia army had taken
from the Israelis previously. And there was peace between the Israelis and the Amor
people-group.
15 Samuel continued to be the leader of the Israeli people until he died.
16 As long as he was alive, every year he traveled back and forth between Bethel
and Gilgal and Mizpah cities. In those cities he listened to disputes between people
and made decisions about them.
17 After he listened to disputes and made decisions in each of those towns, he
returned to his home at Ramah, and he would listen to people’s disputes there, also,
and make decisions about them. And he built an altar at Ramah to offer sacrifices to
Yahweh.
8
The Israelis asked for a king
1 When Samuel became old, he appointed his two sons, Joel and Abijah, to lead/rule
the people of Israel.
1 SAMUEL 8:2
399
1 SAMUEL 9:2
cases.
5 They said to him, “Listen! You are now old, and your sons are not like you.
Appoint a king to rule over us, like the kings that other countries have!”
6 Samuel was very unhappy with them for requesting that, so he prayed to Yahweh
about it.
7 Yahweh replied, “Do what they have requested you to do. But ◄do not think/the
truth is not► that you are the one whom they are really rejecting. I have been their
king, and I am the one they are really rejecting.
8 Ever since I brought them out of Egypt, they have rejected me, and they have
worshiped other gods. And now they are also rejecting you in the same way.
9 Do what they are asking you to do. But warn/tell them about how their kings will
act toward them!”
10 So Samuel told those people what Yahweh had said.
11 He said, “If a king rules over you, this is what he will do to you: He will force
many of your sons to join the army. He will make some of them run in front of his
chariots to clear people out of his way.
12 Some of them will be commanders of his soldiers, but others will work for him
like slaves. He will force some of them to plow his fields and then later harvest his
crops. He will force others to make his weapons and equipment for his chariots.
13 The king will take some of your daughters from you and force them to make
perfumes for him and cook food for him and bake bread for him.
14 He will take your best fields and vineyards and olive tree groves/orchards, and
give them to his own officials.
15 He will take a tenth of your harvests and distribute it among the officers and
servants who work in his palace.
16 He will take from you your male and female servants, your best cattle and
donkeys, and force them to work for him.
17 He will take one tenth of your sheep and goats. And you will become his slaves!
18 When that time comes, you will complain loudly to the king, the king that you
yourselves have chosen, but Yahweh will not ◄pay attention to/help► you.”
19 But the people refused to pay attention to what Samuel said. They said, “We do
not care what you say! We want a king!
20 We want to be like the other nations. We want a king to rule us and to lead our
soldiers when they go to fight.”
21 When Samuel told Yahweh what the people had said,
22 Yahweh replied, “Do what they are telling you to do. Give them a king!” So
Samuel agreed, and then he sent the people home.

Saul met Samuel
1 There was a rich and influential man whose name was Kish. He belonged to the
tribe descended from Benjamin. Kish was the son of Abiel and the grandson of Zeror.
He was from the family of Becorath and from the clan of Aphiah.
2 Kish had a son whose name was Saul. He was more handsome than any of the
other Israeli men, and he was a head/foot taller than any of the other Israeli men.
1 SAMUEL 9:3
1 SAMUEL 9:19
So Kish told Saul, “Take
one of my servants with you, and go and search for the donkeys!”
4 So Saul did that. He took a servant, and they walked through the hilly area
where the descendants of Ephraim lived, and then they went through the areas
named Shalishah and Shaalim, and then they went through all the area where the
descendants of Benjamin lived, but they could not find the donkeys.
5 Finally, they came to the area of Zuph. Then Saul said to the servant, “Let’s go
back home. If we do not do that, my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and
start worrying about us.”
6 But the servant said, “I have another idea [IDM]. There is one of God’s prophets
who lives in this town. People respect him very much, because everything he predicts
comes true. Let’s go talk to him. Perhaps he can tell us where we can go to find the
donkeys.”
7 Saul replied to the servant, “If we go talk with him, we should give a gift to him, but
what can we give to him? We have no more food in our sacks. Do we have anything
else to give to him?”
8 The servant replied, “Look at this! I have a small silver coin. I can give this to
him, and then he will tell us where to go to find the donkeys.”
9-11 Saul said, “Okay, let’s go talk to him.” So they went to the town where the
prophet lived. As they were going up the hill into the town, they met some young
women who were coming out of the town to get some water from a well. One of them
asked the women, “Is the seer in the town today?” They said that because previously,
if people in Israel wanted a message from God, they would say, “Let’s go to the seer,”
and people who now are called prophets were at that time called ‘those who see
◄visions from God/all that God sees►.’
12 The women replied, “Yes, he is in the town. In fact, he is walking on the road
ahead of you. He has just arrived in the town, because the people are going to offer
a sacrifice on the altar where the people gather to worship God.
13 If you go quickly, you will have time to talk to him before he goes there. The people
who have been invited will not start eating until he arrives there and ◄blesses/asks
God to bless► the sacrifice.”
14 So Saul and the servant entered the town. As they went through the gates, they
saw Samuel as he was coming toward them, on the way to where people were going
to offer sacrifices.
15 On the previous day, Yahweh had told Samuel,
16 “At this time tomorrow, I will send to you a man from the land where the
descendants of Benjamin live. Pour olive oil on his head to indicate that he will be
the leader of my Israeli people. I have seen that my people are suffering because the
Philistine people are oppressing them, and I have heard my people as they have called
out to me for help. The man on whose head you pour olive oil will rescue my people
from the [MTY] Philistine people.”
17 When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh said to him, “This is the man I told you about
yesterday! He is the one who will rule my people!”
18 Saul saw Samuel as he was sitting at the town gateway but he did not know that
it was Samuel. He went over to him and asked him, “Can you tell me, where is the
house of the man who sees ◄visions from God/all that God sees►?”
where the people make sacrifices. Both of you will eat with me today. Tomorrow
home.
1 SAMUEL 9:20
401
1 SAMUEL 10:7
20 Also, do not worry any more about those donkeys that wandered away three
days ago. ◄Someone has found them/They have been found►. But what you need to
know is that it is you and your family that all the Israeli people are wanting!” [RHQ]
21 Saul replied, “I am from the tribe of Benjamin [RHQ]. That is the smallest tribe
in Israel [RHQ]! And my family is the least important family in our tribe! So why are
you talking to me like this, about the Israeli people wanting me and my family?”
22 Then Samuel brought Saul and the servant into the big dining room, and told
them to sit at the head of the table, indicating that he was honoring them more than
he was honoring the 30 people who had been invited.
23 Then Samuel told the cook, “Bring to me the special piece of meat that I told you
to set aside.”
24 So the cook brought the leg and the meat that was on it, and set it in front of Saul,
even though those portions were for only the priest to eat. Samuel said to Saul, “Start
eating it. I told the cook to save this for you, so that you could eat it at this time, when
all these people whom I invited are here.” So Saul and Samuel ate together.
25 After they finished eating, they returned to the town. Then Samuel took Saul up
to the flat roof of his house, and fixed a bed for him.
26 As the sun was rising the next morning, Samuel called up to Saul, “Get up! It is
time for me to send you on the road back home.” So Saul got up, and later Samuel
27 When they got to the edge of the town, Samuel told Saul to send his servant
order that I can give you a message I received from God.”
10
1 Then Samuel took a small jar of olive oil and poured some of it on Saul’s head.
Then he kissed Saul on the cheek, and told him, “I am doing this because Yahweh has
chosen you to be the leader of his Israeli people.
2 And this will prove it to you: When you leave me today, when you arrive near
Rachel’s tomb at Zelzah, in the area where the descendants of Benjamin live, you
will meet two men. They will say to you, ‘The donkeys have been found, but now
your father is worrying about you, and he is asking people, “Have you seen my son?’ ”
3 When you arrive at the large oak tree at Tabor town, you will see three men
coming toward you. They will be on their way to worship God at Bethel town. One of
them will be leading three young goats, one will be carrying three loaves of bread,
and one will be carrying a container of wine.
4 They will greet you, and they will offer you two of the loaves of bread. Accept
them.
5 When you arrive at the hill where people worship God near Gibeah town, where
there is the camp where the Philistine soldiers stay, you will meet a group of prophets
who will be coming down from the altar on top of the hill. There will be people in
front of them who will be playing various musical instruments: a harp, a tambourine,
a flute, and a lyre. And all of them will be speaking messages that come directly from
God.
messages that come directly from God. ◄You will be changed/The Spirit of Yahweh
7 After those things occur, do whatever you think is right to do, and God will ◄be
with/help► you.
1 SAMUEL 10:8
402
1 SAMUEL 10:23
8 Then go ahead of me, down to Gilgal city, and wait for me there, for seven days.
Then I will join you there, to burn sacrifices and offer other sacrifices to enable you to
maintain fellowship with God. When I arrive there, I will tell you what other things
you should do.”
What Samuel prophesied came true
9 As Saul started to leave there, God changed Saul’s inner being. And all the things
that Samuel had predicted happened on that day.
10 When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah, they saw some prophets who were
speaking messages that came directly from God. As the prophets were approaching
Saul and his servant, God’s Spirit came upon Saul powerfully, and he also began to
speak messages from God.
11 When people who had known Saul previously heard him speaking messages from
God as the prophets were doing, they said to each other, “What has happened to this
son of Kish? Is he now really one of the ◄prophets/men who speak messages from
God►?”
12 One of the men who lived there replied, “Saul cannot be a prophet, because all
prophets receive their power to speak messages from God, not from their parents.”
And that is why, when people hear about a report of someone prophesying, they think
about what happened to Saul and say, “We are surprised about that person becoming
a prophet, like we were surprised to hear that Saul had really become one of the
prophets.”
13 When Saul finished speaking the messages that God gave him, he went to the
place where the people offered sacrifices.
14 Later, Saul’s uncle saw him there, and asked him, “Where did you go?” Saul
replied, “We went to look for the donkeys. When we could not find them, we came
here to ask Samuel if he could tell us where they were.”
15 Saul’s uncle replied, “What did Samuel tell you?”
16 Saul replied, “He assured us that the donkeys had been found.” But he did not
tell his uncle what Samuel had said about him becoming the king of Israel.
17 Later Samuel summoned the people of Israel to gather at Mizpah to hear a
message from Yahweh.
18 After they arrived, he said to them, “This is what Yahweh, the God we Israeli
people worship, says: I brought you Israeli people out of Egypt. I rescued your
ancestors from the power of the rulers of Egypt and from all the other kings who
oppressed them.
19 I am the one who saves you from all your troubles and difficulties. But today you
have rejected me, your God, and you have said, ‘We don’t care! Give us a king!’ So
I will do what you want. Now have representatives of your tribes and of your clans
stand here in the presence of Yahweh.’ ”
chosen someone from the tribe descended from Benjamin.
God indicated that from that tribe he had chosen someone from the family of Matri,
Kish. But when they looked for Saul, they could not find him.
22 So they asked Yahweh, “Where is Saul?” Yahweh replied, “He is hiding among
the army equipment.”
23 So they quickly went there and found him, and brought him in front of all the
people. They could see that truly he was a head taller than anyone else.
1 SAMUEL 10:24
403
1 SAMUEL 11:10
24 Then Samuel said to all the people there, “This is the man whom Yahweh has
chosen to be your king. Among all us Israeli people, there is no one like him!” Then
all the people shouted, “We hope that this king will live a long time!”
25 Then Samuel told the people what things the king would force them to do, and
all the things the king was required to do. He wrote all those things on a scroll, and
then he put it in a sacred place in the temple. Then Samuel sent all the people home.
26 When Saul returned to his home in Gibeah town, a group of men decided to
continually accompany Saul. They did that because God ◄motivated them/put it in
their minds► to do that.
27 But some worthless men said, “◄How can this man save us from our enemies?/
This man will not be able to save us from our enemies.►” [RHQ] They despised him,
and refused to give him any gifts to show that they would be loyal to him. But Saul
did not say anything to rebuke them.
11
Saul’s army rescued the people of Jabesh
1 About a month later, King Nahash of Ammon led his army across the Jordan River,
and they surrounded Jabesh city in the Gilead region. But all the men of Jabesh went
and said to Nahash, “Make an agreement/treaty with us not to kill us, and then we
will let you rule us.”
2 Nahash replied, “I will do that if you do one thing. Allow us to gouge out all the
right eyes of your people. By doing that we will cause the people in other countries
to despise all you Israeli people.”
3 The leaders of Jabesh replied, “Do not attack us for the next seven days. During
that time, we will send messengers throughout Israel to tell them what you are
demanding. If no one will help us, then we will ◄surrender to you/allow you to
do to us whatever you want►.”
4 Being very confident that his army was very superior, Nahash agreed. So the leaders
of Jabesh sent messengers throughout Israel. When the messengers came to Gibeah,
which was the city where Saul lived, and they told the people there about the situation,
everyone started to cry.
5 At that time, Saul was plowing in the field. When he returned home, he asked,
“Why are all the people crying?” So they told him what the messengers from Jabesh
had reported.
6 Then God’s Spirit came powerfully upon Saul, and he became very angry because
of what Nahash wanted to do.
messengers carrying those pieces throughout Israel to tell people this message: “Saul
anyone who refuses to come with him and Samuel to fight the army from Ammon!”
them (OR, of what Yahweh might do to them) if they did not go and help Saul. So the
men all gathered together.
8 When Saul gave them all weapons at Bezek, he saw that there were 300,000 Israeli
men there, as well as 30,000 men from the tribe of Judah.
9 So Saul sent messengers back to the people at Jabesh to tell them, “We will rescue/
save you by noontime tomorrow.” When the people of Jabesh heard that message,
they were very joyful/happy.
10 Then the men of Jabesh told Nahash, “Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and
then you can do to us whatever you want to.”
1 SAMUEL 11:11
404
1 SAMUEL 12:10
11 But before the sun rose the next morning, Saul and his army arrived. He divided
them into three groups. They rushed into the camp of the soldiers from Ammon, and
attacked them. By noontime they had killed most of them, and those who were not
killed scattered. Each of them who ran away ran away alone.
The people proclaimed Saul as king
12 Then the people of Jabesh said to Samuel, “Where are those men who said that
they did not want Saul to be our king? Bring them here, and we will kill them!”
13 But Saul replied, “No, we are not going to execute anyone today, because this
is the day that Yahweh has saved us Israeli people. It is a day to rejoice, not to kill
anyone.”
14 Then Samuel said to the people, “Let’s all go to Gilgal, and there we will again
proclaim that Saul is our king.”
There, knowing that Yahweh was watching, they
proclaimed that Saul was their king. Then they offered sacrifices to enable them
to maintain fellowship with Yahweh. And Saul and all the other Israeli people were
very happy.
12
Samuel’s final speech
1 Then Samuel said this to all the Israeli people: “I have done everything that you
told me to do, and I have given/appointed a king to rule you.
2 My own sons are grown up and with you now, but I have appointed Saul instead
of one of them, and he is now your leader. I am now old, and my hair is gray. I have
been your leader ever since I was a boy.
3 Now tell me, while Yahweh is listening, and while the king whom he has chosen
is listening: whose ox or donkey have I stolen during all those years? Whom have
bribe, in order that I would ignore the evil things he had done? If I have done any of
4 They replied, “No, you have never cheated anyone or oppressed anyone or
5 Then Samuel said, “Today Yahweh can testify, and the king whom you chose can
testify, that I have not taken a bribe from anyone.” They replied, “Yes, Yahweh can
say that he knows that is true.”
6 Samuel continued by saying, “Yahweh is the one who appointed Moses and Aaron
to lead our ancestors. He is the one who brought them out of Egypt. And he is the one
who will testify that what I am saying is true.
7 Now while Yahweh is listening, stand here quietly while I accuse you and tell you
that your requesting a king instead of trusting Yahweh to lead you was wrong. I will
do that by reminding you of all the great miracles that Yahweh performed for you
and your ancestors.
8 “Many years after Jacob went to Egypt, our ancestors pleaded to Yahweh to help
them. So Yahweh sent Moses and Aaron to them, and they led our ancestors out of
Egypt, and eventually they settled in this land.
9 “But our ancestors soon forgot about Yahweh, their God. So he allowed Sisera, the
commander of the army from Hazor, to defeat them. He also allowed the Philistines
and the army of the king of Moab to fight our ancestors and defeat them.
10 Then our ancestors pleaded with Yahweh again to help them. They admitted,
‘Yahweh, we have sinned, and we have forsaken you. We have worshiped idols that
1 SAMUEL 12:11
405
1 SAMUEL 13:2
represent the god Baal and the goddess Astarte. But if you rescue us from our enemies,
we will worship you only.’
11 So Yahweh sent men such as Gideon, Barak, Jephthah, and me to save you. And
as a result, you did not have to worry about any enemies attacking you.
12 “But now, when king Nahash of Ammon came with his army to attack you, you
were afraid. So, you came to me, and said, ‘We want a king to rule us,’ even though
Yahweh was already your king!
13 So now, look, here is the king whom you have chosen. You asked for a king, and
Yahweh has now appointed a king for you.
14 If you will revere Yahweh and if you serve him, and if you listen to what he says
and obey what he commands, and if you and the king who rules over you do what
Yahweh your God wants you to do, ◄things will go well for you all/Yahweh will bless
you►.
15 But if you do not listen to what Yahweh says, if you disobey what he commands,
then he will punish [MTY] you all, just as he punished our ancestors.
16 “Now stand here quietly and see the great thing that Yahweh is about to do.
17 You know that [RHQ] it does not rain at this time of the year, during the time
when you harvest wheat. But I will ask Yahweh to send thunder and lightning and
rain today. When he does that, you will realize that Yahweh considers that you have
done a very wicked thing by requesting a king.”
18 Then Samuel prayed to Yahweh, and Yahweh caused it to thunder and lightning
and rain. So all the people became very afraid of Yahweh and of Samuel.
19 They cried out to Samuel, “Pray for us! We have added to our previous sins by
requesting a king! Pray to Yahweh, your God, in order that we will not die because
of having done that!”
away from doing the things that Yahweh wants you to do. Instead, serve Yahweh
21 Do not abandon Yahweh and worship useless idols. They cannot help you or save
22 Yahweh decided to make us his people. So he will not abandon us people whom
he has chosen, because he would injure his own reputation of being completely faithful
if he did that.
23 But as for me, I have solemnly promised that I will not sin against Yahweh by
ceasing to pray for you. And I will continue to teach you what things are good and
right for you to do.
24 But you must revere Yahweh and serve him wholeheartedly. Never forget all the
great things that he has done for you.
25 But if you keep doing wicked things, he will get rid of you and your king!”
13
Saul disobeyed God
1 Saul was no longer a young man when he became the king.
He ruled Israel for
42 years.
2 Several years after he became king, he chose three thousand men from the Israeli
army to go with him to fight the Philistines. Then he sent the other soldiers back
home. Of the men he chose, 2,000 stayed with Saul at Micmash and in the hilly area
near Bethel, and 1,000 stayed with Saul’s son Jonathan at Gibeah, in the area where
the descendants of Benjamin lived.
1 SAMUEL 13:3
406
1 SAMUEL 13:16
3 Jonathan and the men who were with him attacked the Philistine soldiers who were
camped at Geba. The other Philistines heard about that. So Saul realized that the army
of Philistia would probably come to fight the Israelis again. So Saul sent messengers to
blow trumpets throughout Israel to gather the people together and proclaim to them,
“All you Hebrews need to hear that now the Philistines will start a war with us!”
4 The messengers told the rest of the army to gather together with Saul at Gilgal.
And all the people in Israel heard the news. People were saying, “Saul’s army has
attacked the Philistine camp, with the result that now the Philistines hate us Israelis
very much.”
5 The Philistines gathered together and were given equipment to fight the Israelis.
The Philistines had 3,000 chariots, and 6,000 chariot-drivers. Their soldiers seemed
to be as many as grains of sand on the seashore [HYP]. They went up and set up their
tents at Micmash, to the east of Beth-Aven (which means ‘house of wickedness’, and
really referred to Bethel town).
6 The Philistines attacked the Israelis very strongly, and the Israeli soldiers realized
that they were in a very bad situation. So many of the Israeli soldiers hid in caves
and holes in the ground, or among the rocks, or in pits, or in wells.
7 Some of them crossed the Jordan River at a place where it was very shallow. Then
But Saul stayed at Gilgal. All the soldiers who were with him were shaking because

the altar and one for the offering to enable us to maintain fellowship with God.” So
the men did that.
10 And just as he was finished burning those offerings, Samuel arrived. Saul went
to greet him.
11 Samuel saw what Saul had done, and he said to Saul, “Why have you done this?”
Saul replied, “I saw that my men were leaving me and running away, and that you
did not come here during the time that you said that you would come, and that the
Philistine army was gathering together at Micmash.
12 “So I thought, ‘The Philistine army is going to attack us here at Gilgal, and I have
not yet asked Yahweh to bless/help us.’ So I felt it was necessary to offer the burnt
offerings to seek God’s blessings.”
13 Samuel replied, “What you did was very foolish! You have not obeyed what
Yahweh, your God, commanded about sacrifices. If you had obeyed him, God would
have allowed you and your descendants to rule Israel for a long time.
14 But now because of what you have done, you will die, and after you die, none
of your descendants will rule. Yahweh is seeking for a man to be king who will be
just the kind of person that he wants him to be, so that he can appoint him to be
the leader of his people. Yahweh will do this because you have not obeyed what he
commanded.”
15 Then Samuel left Gilgal and went up to Gibeah. Saul stayed at Gilgal with his
soldiers. There were only about 600 of them left who had not run away.
Saul’s army had difficulties
16 Saul and his son Jonathan and the soldiers who were with them went to Geba
city in the area of the tribe of Benjamin and set up their tents there. The Philistine
army set up their tents at Micmash.
1 SAMUEL 13:17
407
1 SAMUEL 14:10
17 Three
groups of Philistia men soon left the place where their army was
staying, and went and ◄raided the Israeli towns/attacked the Israelis and took their
possessions►. One group went north toward Ophrah city in the Shual region.
18 One group went west to Beth-Horon city. The third group went toward the Israeli
border, above Zeboim Valley, near the desert.
19 At that time, there were no men in Israel who ◄were blacksmiths/could make
things from iron►. The people of Philistia would not permit the Israelis to do that,
because they were afraid that they would make iron swords and spears for the
Hebrews to fight with.
20 So whenever the Israelis needed to sharpen the blades of their plows, or picks, or
axes, or sickles, they were forced to take those things to a Philistia man who could
sharpen those things.
21 They needed to pay ◄one fourth of an ounce/8 grams► of silver for sharpening
or ◄an ox goad/a pointed rod to jab an ox to make it walk►.
Israelis fought against the men of Philistia, Saul and Jonathan were the only Israeli
men who had swords. None of the others had a sword; they had only bows and arrows.
23 Before the battle started, some Philistia men went to ◄the pass/a narrow place
between two cliffs► outside Micmash to guard it.
14
me; we will go over to where the Philistia soldiers have put up their tents.” So they
went, but Jonathan did not tell his father what they were going to do.
2 On that day, Saul and the 600 soldiers who were with him were sitting around a
pomegranate tree at a place where the people threshed grain, near Gibeah.
3 Ahijah the priest was also there. He was wearing the sacred vest. Ahijah was the
son of Ahitub, who was a brother of Ichabod. Ichabod and Ahitub were the sons of
Phinehas, who was the son of Eli, who had been Yahweh’s priest at Shiloh.
No one knew that Jonathan had left the Israeli camp.
4 Jonathan planned that he and the young man would go through a narrow ◄pass/
place between two cliffs► to get to where the Philistia army was. The cliff on one
side of the pass was named Bozez, and the other cliff was named Seneh.
5 One cliff faced north toward Micmash, and the cliff on the other side faced south
toward Geba town.
6 Jonathan said to the young man who carried his weapons, “Come with me. We
will go to where those ◄pagans/people who do not believe in Yahweh► [MTY] have
set up their tents. Perhaps Yahweh will help us. It does not matter whether we are
them.”
is the best thing for us to do. I will help you.”
8 Then Jonathan said, “Okay, come with me. We will cross the valley to where the
Philistia army is, and allow them to see us.
9 If they then say to us, ‘You two stay there until we come down to you,’ we will
stay there and not go up to them.
10 But if they say to us, ‘Come up here and fight against us,’ that will show us that
Yahweh will enable us to defeat them. Then we will go up and fight them.”
1 SAMUEL 14:11
408
1 SAMUEL 14:24
11 When the two of them crossed the valley, the Philistia soldiers saw them coming.
They said, “Look! The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes in which they have been
hiding!”
12 Then the Philistia soldiers who were closest to Jonathan and the young man who
carried his weapons said, “Come up here, and we will teach you something about
how to fight [IDM]!”
Jonathan said to the young man who was with him, “Come behind me and climb
up, because Yahweh is going to help us to defeat them!”
13 So Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and his feet because it was very steep.
The young man climbed up following him. As Jonathan climbed, he struck and killed
he followed behind Jonathan.
that was about half an acre.
been attacking the Israeli towns, ones who were out in the field much closer, panicked.
Then God caused the ground to shake, and they all became terrified/very afraid.
The Israelis defeated the Philistia army
16 Saul’s ◄lookouts/men who were watching to see if enemies were coming► were
in Gibeah town in the land of the tribe of Benjamin. They saw that the soldiers of the
Philistia army were running away in all directions.
17 Saul realized that some of his soldiers must have attacked the Philistia army. So
he said to the soldiers who were with him, “Check to see if any of our men are not
here.” So they checked, and they found out that Jonathan and the man who carried
his weapons were gone.
18 So Saul said to Ahijah the Supreme Priest, “Bring the sacred vest here and find
out what we should do.” On that day Ahijah was wearing the sacred vest, going in
front of the Israelis.
19 But while Saul was talking to the priest, he saw that the Philistia soldiers were
becoming more panicked/confused. So Saul said to Ahijah, “Take your hand down
from the sacred vest. Do not waste any more time using the marked stones in the vest
to find out what Yahweh wants us to do.”
20 Then Saul gathered his men and they went toward the battle. They found that
the Philistia soldiers were so confused that they were striking each other with their
swords.
21 Before that, some of the Hebrew men had deserted their army and gone to
join with the Philistia army. But now those men revolted and joined with Saul and
Jonathan and the other Israeli soldiers.
22 Some of the Israeli soldiers had previously run away and hidden in the mountains
where the tribe of Ephraim lived. But when they heard that the Philistia soldiers were
running away, they came down and joined the other Israeli soldiers and pursued the
Philistia soldiers.
23 So Yahweh rescued the Israelis on that day. The Israeli soldiers continued to
pursue their enemies beyond Beth-Aven town.
The dispute about Jonathan eating honey
24 Before Saul’s soldiers went to the battle, Saul declared to them solemnly, “I do
not want any of you to eat any food before this evening, before we have defeated all
our enemies. If anyone eats anything, Yahweh will curse/punish him.” So none of
the Israeli soldiers ate any food, and they became faint/weak because they were very
hungry.
1 SAMUEL 14:25
409
1 SAMUEL 14:41
25 The Israeli army went into the forest, and they found honeycombs on the ground,
but they did not eat any honey.
26 They were afraid to eat any, because they had solemnly promised that they would
27 But Jonathan did not hear what his father commanded because he had left the
his walking stick into it and ate some honey. After he ate the honey, he felt stronger.
28 But one of the Israeli soldiers saw him and said to him, “Your father solemnly
declared to us that Yahweh would curse/punish anyone who ate any food today. So
now we are very tired and weak from being hungry because we obeyed him.”
29 Jonathan exclaimed, “My father has caused trouble for all of us! See how
refreshed/strong I am after eating a little honey!
30 If he had permitted all of us to eat from the food we took from our enemies
while we were pursuing them, we would have been able to kill many more of their
soldiers!”
31 The Israelis pursued and killed Philistia soldiers all that day, from Micmash town
west to Aijalon. But they continued to become weaker from being hungry.
32 They had taken many sheep and cattle that the Philistia soldiers had abandoned.
Now, because they were extremely hungry, they butchered some of those animals
and ate the meat without draining the blood from the animals.
33 One of the soldiers told Saul, “Look! The men are sinning against Yahweh by
eating meat that still has blood in it!”
Saul replied to the men who were near him, “They have disobeyed Yahweh! Roll a
large stone over here!”
34 After they did that, he said to those men, “Go and tell all the soldiers that each of
them must bring an ox or a sheep to me, and kill it here on this stone, and drain the
blood before he eats any of the meat. They should not sin against Yahweh by eating
meat from some animal without draining its blood.” So that night all the soldiers
brought animals and slaughtered them there. Then Saul built an altar to worship
Yahweh.
35 That was the first time that he built an altar for Yahweh.
The soldiers rescued Jonathan from Saul
36 Then Saul said to the Israeli soldiers, “Let’s pursue the Philistia soldiers tonight.
We can attack them all night. We will not allow any of them to escape alive.”
The Israeli soldiers answered, “We will do whatever you think is the best thing for
us to do.”
But the priest said, “We should ask Yahweh what he thinks we should do.”
37 So Saul asked God, “Should we pursue the Philistine soldiers? Will you enable
us to defeat them?” But God did not answer Saul that day.
38 Then Saul summoned all the leaders of his army. He said to them, “I am sure
that God has not answered me because someone has sinned. We must find out what
sin someone has committed.
39 Yahweh has rescued us from the Philistia army. Just as certain as Yahweh lives,
whoever has sinned must be executed. Even if it is my son Jonathan who has sinned,
he must be executed.”
His men knew who was guilty, but none of them said anything to Saul.
40 Then Saul said to all the Israeli soldiers, “You stand on one side. My son Jonathan
and I will stand on the other side.”
His men replied, “Do whatever you think is best.”
41 Then Saul prayed to Yahweh, the Israelis’ God, “Tell me who is guilty and who
is not guilty.” Then the priest ◄cast lots/threw the stones that were marked►, and
1 SAMUEL 14:42
the other men were not guilty.
42 Then Saul said to the priest, “Throw the stones again to indicate which of us two
is guilty.” So he did, and the stones indicated that Jonathan was the guilty one.
43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done that was wrong.”
Jonathan replied, “I ate a little bit of honey. It was only a little bit that was on the
end of my stick. Do I deserve to be executed because of doing that?”
44 Saul replied, “Yes, you must be executed! I hope/wish that God will strike me
and kill me if you are not executed for having done that!”
45 But the Israeli soldiers said to Saul, “Jonathan has won a great victory for all us
Israelis. Should he be executed for eating some honey [RHQ]? Certainly not! Just as
surely as Yahweh lives, we will not allow you to injure him in any manner [IDM],
because today God helped Jonathan to kill many soldiers of the Philistia army!”
So by saying that the Israeli soldiers rescued Jonathan, and he was not executed.
46 Then Saul ordered his soldiers to stop pursuing the Philistia army, so the Philistia
soldiers returned to their homes.
Saul’s army defeated many of their enemies
47 After Saul became the ruler/king of the Israeli people, his army fought against
their enemies in many areas. They fought against armies of the Moab people-group,
the Ammon people-group, the Edom people-group, the kings of Zobah city/area, and
the Philistia people-group. Wherever the Israeli army fought, they defeated their
enemies.
48 Saul’s army fought bravely and defeated the very tall descendants of Amalek.
from► them.
49 Saul’s sons were Jonathan, Ishbosheth, and Malchishua.
He also had two
daughters, Merab and her younger sister Michal.
50 Saul’s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz. The commander of Saul’s
army was Abner, who was the son of Saul’s uncle Ner.
51 Saul’s father Kish and Abner’s father Ner were both sons of Abiel.
52 All the time that Saul was alive, his army fought against the Philistia army. And
whenever Saul saw a young man who was ◄brave/not afraid to fight► and strong, he
forced him to join his army.
15
Saul’s army defeated the Amalekites
1 One day Samuel said to Saul, “Yahweh sent me to appoint you to be the king of
the Israeli people. So now listen to this message from Yahweh:
2 Yahweh, the commander of the armies of angels has declared this: ‘I am going
to punish the descendants of Amalek for attacking the Israeli people after the Israelis
left Egypt.
3 So now go with your army and attack the Amalek people-group. Destroy them
completely—destroy them and everything that belongs to them—the men and women,
their children and infants, their cattle and sheep and camels and donkeys. Do not
◄spare any of them/allow any of them to remain alive►!’ ”
4 So Saul summoned the army, and they gathered at Telaim town. There were
200,000 soldiers. 10,000 of them were from Judah, and the others were from the other
Israeli tribes.
5 Then Saul went with his army to a town where some of the Amalek people-group
lived. His army prepared to attack them suddenly by hiding in the valley.
1 SAMUEL 15:23
6 Then Saul sent this message to the Ken people-group who lived in that area: “You
acted kindly toward all our Israeli ancestors when they left Egypt. But we are going
to kill all of the Amalek people-group, because they opposed/attacked our ancestors.
So move away from where the Amalek people-group live. If you do not move away,
you will be killed when they are killed.” So when the Ken people-group heard that,
they immediately left that area.
7 Then Saul’s army slaughtered the Amalek people-group, from Havilah town in the
east to Shur town in the west. Shur was at the border between Israel and Egypt.
everyone else.
goats and cattle. They took everything that was good. They destroyed only the
animals that they considered to be worthless.
Yahweh rejected Saul as king
10 Then Yahweh said to Samuel,
11 “I am sorry that I appointed Saul to be your king, because he has turned away
from me and has not obeyed what I commanded him to do.” Samuel was very
disturbed/upset when he heard that, and he cried out to Yahweh all that night.
12 Early the next morning, Samuel got up and went to talk with Saul. But someone
told Samuel, “Saul went to Camel city, where he has set up a monument to honor
himself. Now he has left there and gone down to Gilgal.”
13 When Samuel arrived at Gilgal he approached Saul, and Saul said to him,, “I
wish/desire that Yahweh will bless you! I have obeyed what Yahweh told me to do.”
14 But Samuel replied, “If that is true, why is it that I hear cattle mooing and I hear
sheep bleating?”
15 Saul replied, “The soldiers took them from the Amalek people-group. They saved
the best sheep and cattle, in order to offer them as sacrifices to Yahweh, your God.
But we have completely destroyed all the others.”
16 Samuel said to Saul, “Stop talking! Allow me to tell you what Yahweh said to me
last night.”
Saul replied, “Tell me what he said.”
17 Samuel said, “Previously you did not think that you were important. But now
you have become [RHQ] the leader of the tribes of Israel. Yahweh appointed you to
be their king.
18 And Yahweh sent you to do something for him. He said to you, ‘Go and get rid of
all those sinful people, the Amalek people-group. Attack them and kill all of them.’
19 So why did you not obey Yahweh [RHQ]? Why did your men take the best animals
[RHQ]? Why did you do what Yahweh said was evil?” [RHQ]
20 Saul replied to Samuel, “Hey, I did what Yahweh sent me to do! I brought back
King Agag, but we killed everyone else!
21 My men brought back only the best sheep and cattle and other things, in order
to sacrifice them to Yahweh your God here at Gilgal.”
22 But Samuel replied,
“Which do you think pleases Yahweh more, animals that are completely burned on
the altar and other sacrifices,
or people obeying him [SYN]?
It is better to pay attention to what he says than to burn the fat of rams, even though
23 To rebel against God is as sinful as doing sorcery/black magic,
1 SAMUEL 15:24
412
1 SAMUEL 16:1
and being stubborn is as sinful as worshiping idols.
So, because you disobeyed what Yahweh told you to do,
he has declared that you will no longer be king.”
Saul asks to be forgiven
24 Then Saul said to Samuel, “Yes, I have sinned. I disobeyed what you told me to
do, which is what Yahweh commanded. I did that because I was ◄afraid of/worried
about► what my men would say if I did not do what they wanted. So I did what they
demanded.
25 But now, please forgive me for having sinned. And come back with me to where
the people are in order that I may worship Yahweh.”
26 But Samuel replied, “No, I will not go back with you. You have rejected/disobeyed
what Yahweh commanded you to do. So he has rejected you, and declared that you
will no longer be the king of Israel. So I do not want to talk any more with you.”
27 As Samuel turned to leave, Saul tried to stop him by grabbing the edge of Samuel’s
robe, and it tore.
28 Samuel said to him, “You tore my robe! And today Yahweh has torn away from
you the kingdom of Israel! He will appoint someone else to be king, someone who is
a better man than you are.
29 And since the one who is the glorious God of the Israeli people does not lie, he will
not change ◄his mind/what he has said►. Humans sometimes change their minds,
but God does not do that, because he is not a human.”
30 Then Saul pleaded again. He said, “I know that I have sinned. But please honor
me in front of the leaders of the Israeli people and in front of all the other Israeli
people by coming back to them with me in order that I may worship Yahweh your
God.”
31 So Samuel finally agreed to do that, and they went together back to where the
people were, and Saul worshiped Yahweh there.
“Surely I will not have to endure an agonizing death!”
33 But Samuel said to him,
“You have killed the sons of many women with your sword,
so now your mother will no longer have a son.”
And Samuel cut Agag into pieces with his sword, there at Gilgal, in the presence of
Yahweh.
34 Then Samuel left there and returned to his home in Ramah, and Saul went to his
home in Gibeah.
35 Samuel never saw Saul again, but he was very sad about what Saul had done.
And Yahweh was very sorry that he had appointed Saul to be the king of Israel.
16
Samuel appointed David to be king
1 Finally, Yahweh said to Samuel, “I have decided that I will not allow Saul to
continue to be the king. So you should not [RHQ] keep feeling sad about what he
has done. Put some olive oil in a small container and go to Bethlehem to anoint
someone with the oil, and appoint him to be king. I am sending you there to a man
named Jesse, because I have chosen one of his sons to be the king of Israel.”
1 SAMUEL 16:2
413
1 SAMUEL 16:18
2 But Samuel said, “I am afraid [RHQ] to do that! If Saul hears about it, he will kill
me!” Yahweh said, “Take a ◄heifer/young female cow► with you, and say to people
that you have come to kill it and offer it as a sacrifice to me.
3 “Invite Jesse to come to the sacrifice. When he comes, I will show you what you
should do. And I will show you which of his sons I have chosen to be the king. Then
you should anoint that one with the olive oil to be the king.”
4 Samuel did what Yahweh told him to do. He went to Bethlehem. When the town
leaders came to him, they trembled, because they were worried that Samuel had come
to rebuke them about something. One of them asked him, “Have you come to speak
peacefully to us?”
5 Samuel replied, “Yes. I have come peacefully, to make a sacrifice to Yahweh.
Perform the rituals to make yourselves acceptable to Yahweh, and then come with
me to where they will offer the sacrifice.” Then Samuel performed the ritual to make
Jesse and his sons acceptable to God, and he also invited them to the sacrifice.
6 When they arrived there, Samuel looked at Jesse’s oldest son Eliab, and thought,
“Surely this is the one whom Yahweh has appointed to be king!”
7 But Yahweh said to Samuel, “No, he is not the one whom I have chosen. Don’t pay
attention to his being handsome and very tall, because I have not chosen him. I do
not evaluate people as people do. You people evaluate people by their appearance,
but I evaluate people by what is in their inner beings.”
8 Then Jesse told his next oldest son Abinadab to step forward and walk in front of
Samuel. But when he did that, Samuel said, “Yahweh has not chosen this one, either.”
9 Then Jesse told his next oldest son Shammah to step forward. He stepped forward,
but Samuel said, “Yahweh has not chosen this one, either.”
10 Similarly, Jesse told his other four sons to walk in front of Samuel. But Samuel
said to Jesse, “Yahweh has not chosen any of these sons of yours.”
11 Then Samuel asked Jesse, “Do you have any other sons?” Jesse replied, “My
youngest son is not here; he is out in the fields taking care of the sheep.” Samuel said,
“Send someone to bring him here! We will not sit down to eat until he gets here.”
12 So Jesse sent someone to bring David there. And when David arrived, Samuel saw
the one whom I have chosen; anoint him to be king.”
of oil that he had brought and poured some of it on David’s head to set him apart to
came on David powerfully, and stayed with David for the rest of his life.
14 But Yahweh’s Spirit left Saul. Instead of his Spirit staying with Saul, Yahweh sent
an evil spirit to Saul to terrify him repeatedly.
15 One of his servants said to him, “It is evident that an evil spirit sent by God is
terrifying you.
16 So we suggest that you allow us, your servants here, to search for a man who
plays the harp well. He can play the harp whenever the evil spirit bothers you. Then
you will calm down and you will be okay again.”
17 Saul replied, “Fine/Okay, find for me a man who can play the harp well, and bring
him to me.”
18 One of his servants said to him, “A man named Jesse, in Bethlehem town, has a
son who plays the harp very well. Furthermore, he is a brave man, and is a capable
soldier. He is handsome and he always speaks wisely. And Yahweh always protects
him.”
1 SAMUEL 16:19
414
1 SAMUEL 17:14
19 So Saul sent this message to Jesse:
“Send your son David to me, the one who
takes care of sheep.”
20 So after they went to Jesse and told him that, he agreed. He got a young goat, a
container of wine, a donkey on which he put some loaves of bread, and gave them
to David to take to Saul as a present.
21 Then David went to Saul and started to work for him. Saul liked David very
much, and he became the man who carried Saul’s weapons when Saul went to fight
in battles.
22 Then Saul sent a messenger to Jesse to tell him, “I am pleased with David. Please
let him stay here and work for me.”
23 Jesse agreed, and after that, whenever the evil spirit whom God sent tormented
Saul, David played the harp. Then Saul would become calm, and the evil spirit would
leave him.
17
Goliath challenged the Israeli army
1 The Philistines gathered their army to fight the Israeli army.
They gathered
together near Socoh, in the area where the descendants of Judah lived. They set
up their tents at Ephes-Dammim, which is between Socoh and Azekah.
2 Saul gathered the Israeli army near Elah Valley, and they set up their tents. Then
they all took their places, ready to fight the Philistines.
3 So the Philistine and Israeli armies faced each other. They were on two hills, with
a valley between them.
champion warrior/soldier. He was ◄over 9 feet/3 meters► tall.
of metal plates to protect his body. The coat weighed ◄125 pounds/56 kg.►.
6 He wore bronze guards/protectors on his legs. He had a long bronze dagger
fastened on his back.
7 He also had a big spear. It had a cord on it to enable him to throw it better (OR,
which was as thick as a weaver’s beam). The tip of the spear was made of iron and
weighed ◄15 pounds/almost 7 kg.►. A soldier carrying a huge shield walked in front
of him.
8 Goliath stood there and shouted to the Israeli army, “Why are you all lined up
for battle? I am the great Philistine soldier, and I think [RHQ] you are merely Saul’s
slaves. Choose one man to fight for all of you, and send him down here to me!
9 If he fights with me and kills me, then my fellow Philistines will all be your slaves.
But if I defeat him and kill him, then you Israelis will all be our slaves.
me!”
[DOU].
David went to Saul’s camp
12 David was the son of Jesse.
Jesse was from the clan of Ephrath. He lived in
Bethlehem, in the area where the descendants of Judah lived. Jesse had eight sons.
When Saul was king, Jesse had already become a very old man [DOU].
13 Jesse’s three oldest sons, Eliab and Abinadab and Shammah, had gone with Saul
to fight the Philistines.
14 David was Jesse’s youngest son. While his three oldest brothers were with Saul,
1 SAMUEL 17:15
415
1 SAMUEL 17:33
15 David went back and forth: Sometimes he went to Saul’s camp, and sometimes
he stayed in Bethlehem to take care of his father’s sheep.
16 For 40 days Goliath came out from the Philistine camp and stood there taunting
the Israeli army/telling the Israelis to choose one man to fight with him. He did it twice
each day, once in the morning and once in the evening.
17 One day, Jesse said to David, “Here is a sack of roasted grain and ten loaves of
bread. Take these quickly to your older brothers.
18 And here are ten large chunks of cheese. Take them to their commander. And
see how things are going with your older brothers. Then if they are okay, bring back
something to show they are all right.”
19 His brothers were with Saul and all the other Israeli soldiers, camped alongside
Elah Valley, preparing to fight the Philistines.
20 So David arranged for another shepherd to take care of the sheep. Early the next
morning he took the food and went to the Israeli camp, as Jesse told him to do. He
arrived there just as the Israeli soldiers were forming their ranks and going out to
the battlefield. As they went, they were shouting a war cry.
21 The Philistine army and the Israeli army stood on the hillsides, facing each other,
22 David gave the food to the man who was taking care of the war equipment. He
older brothers.
Philistine soldiers, shouting to the Israelis, challenging them to send a man to fight
him. David heard what Goliath was saying.
24 When all the Israeli soldiers saw Goliath, they were terrified and started to ran
away.
25 They were saying to each other, “Look at him coming up toward us! And listen to
him as he defies us Israelis! The king says that he will give a big reward to whoever
kills this man. He also says that he will give his daughter to that man for him to
marry her, and that he will no longer require that man’s family to pay taxes.”
26 David talked to some of the men who were standing near him. He said, “What
will be given to whoever kills this Philistine and frees us Israelis from this shame/
disgrace? And who does this heathen Philistine think he is, defying/ridiculing the
army that serves the all-powerful God?”
27 They told him the same thing that the other men had said, about what the king
would do for anyone who killed Goliath.
28 But when David’s oldest brother Eliab heard David talking to the men, he was
angry. He said to David, “Why have you come down here? Is someone taking care
of those few sheep that you left in the desert? I know you are just a ◄smart-aleck/
brat►! You just want to watch the battle!”
29 David replied, “Have I done something wrong? I was merely asking a question!”
30 Then he walked over to another man and asked him the same question, but the
man gave him the same answer. Each time he asked someone, he received the same
answer.
31 Finally, someone told king Saul what David had asked, and Saul sent someone to
bring David to him.
32 David told king Saul, “No one should ◄worry/become a coward► because of that
Philistine man. I will go and fight with him!”
33 Saul said to David, “You are only a young man, and he has been a very capable
soldier all his life. So you are not able to go and fight with him!”
1 SAMUEL 17:34
416
1 SAMUEL 17:52
34 David replied, “I have been taking care of my father’s sheep for many years.
Whenever a lion or a bear came and carried away a lamb,
35 I went after the lion or the bear and attacked it and rescued the lamb from the
wild animal’s mouth. Then I grabbed the animal by its jaw/throat and struck it and
killed it.
36 I have killed both lions and bears. And I will do the same to this heathen
Philistine, because he has defied/ridiculed the army of the all-powerful God!
37 Yahweh has rescued me from paws of lions and bears, and he will rescue me
from this Philistine!” Then Saul said to David, “All right, go and fight him, and I hope/
desire that Yahweh will help you!”
38 Then Saul gave to David his own clothes that he always wore in battles, and he
gave him a bronze helmet and a coat made of metal plates.
39 David put these things on. Then he fastened his sword over them, and tried
to walk. But he could not walk, because he was not accustomed to wearing those
things. So David said to Saul, “I cannot fight wearing all these things, because I am
not accustomed to wearing them!” So he took them off.
40 Then he took his walking/shepherd’s stick, and he picked up five smooth stones
from the brook/stream. He put them in the pouch of his shoulder-bag. Then he put
David killed Goliath
41 Goliath walked toward David,
with the soldier who was carrying his shield
walking in front of him. When he got near David,
42 he looked at David closely. He saw that David had a handsome face and healthy
body, but that he was only a young man. So he sneered at David.
43 He said to David, “Are you coming to me with a stick because you think that I am
a dog?” Then he called out to his gods to harm David.
44 He said to David, “Come here to me, and I will kill you and give your dead body
to the birds and wild animals to eat!”
45 David replied, “You are coming to me with a sword and a dagger and a spear.
But I am coming to you ◄in the name/with the authority► of almighty Yahweh. He is
the God whom the army of Israel worships, and he is the God whom you have defied/
ridiculed.
46 Today Yahweh will enable me to defeat you. I will strike you down and cut off
your head. And we Israelis will kill many Philistine soldiers and give their bodies to
the birds and wild animals to eat. And everyone in the world will hear about it and
know that we Israeli people worship an all-powerful God.
47 And everyone here will know that Yahweh can rescue people without a sword
or a spear. Yahweh always wins his battles, and he will enable us to defeat all of you
Philistines.”
48 As Goliath came closer to attack David, David ran quickly toward him.
49 He put his hand into his shoulder-bag and took out one stone. He put it in his sling
and hurled it toward Goliath. The stone hit Goliath on the forehead and penetrated
his skull, and he fell face down onto the ground.
50-51 Then David ran and stood over Goliath. He pulled Goliath’s sword from its
sheath and killed him with it, and then cut off his head. In that way David defeated
the Philistine without having his own sword. He used only a sling and a stone!
When the other Philistines saw that their great warrior was dead, they ran away.
52 The Israeli men shouted and ran after them. They pursued them all the way to
Gath and to the gates of Ekron city. They struck them as they went, with the result
that dead/wounded Philistines were lying on the road all the way from Shaaraim to
Gath and Ekron towns.
1 SAMUEL 17:53
417
1 SAMUEL 18:14
53 When the Israelis returned from chasing the Philistines, they ◄plundered/took
everything from► the Philistine camp.
54 David later took the head of Goliath to Jerusalem, but he kept Goliath’s weapons
in his own tent.
55 As Saul watched David going toward Goliath, he said to Abner, the commanded
of his army, “Abner, whose son is that young man?” Abner replied, “◄As sure as you
are alive/Truly► [IDM], I do not know.”
56 Then the king said, “Find out whose son he is!”
carrying Goliath’s head.
you have forgotten that I am the son of your servant Jesse, who has served you
Saul became jealous of David
1 After David finished talking with Saul, he met Saul’s son, Jonathan.
Jonathan
immediately liked David; in fact, he began to love/like him as much as he loved/liked
himself.
2 From that day, Saul kept David with him, and did not let him return home.
3 Because Jonathan loved David so much, he made a solemn agreement with David.
They promised each other that they would always be loyal friends.
4 Jonathan took off his own outer robe and gave it to David. He also gave David his
soldier’s tunic, his sword, his bow and arrows, and his belt.
5 David went wherever Saul sent him. And whatever Saul told him to do, David did it
very successfully. As a result, Saul appointed David to be a commander in the army.
All the officers and other men in the army ◄approved of/were very pleased with►
that.
6 But, when the men in the army were returning home after David had killed
Goliath, the women came out from many [HYP] towns in Israel to meet/greet King
Saul. They were singing and dancing very joyfully, playing tambourines and lyres.
7 As they danced, they sang this song to each other:
“Saul has killed 1,000 enemy soldiers,
But David has killed 10,000 of them.”
8 When Saul heard them singing that, he did not like it. He became very angry. He
said to himself, “They are saying that David killed 10,000 men, but that I have killed
only 1,000. Soon they will want to make him their king!” [RHQ]
9 From that time, Saul watched David very closely because he was suspicious that
David would try to become king.
10 The next day, an evil spirit sent by God suddenly took control of Saul. He began
to act like a madman, inside his house. David was playing the lyre for him, as he did
every day. Saul was holding a spear in his hand,
11 and he hurled it at David, saying to himself, “I will fasten David to the wall with
the spear!” He did that two times, but David jumped aside both times.
12 Because it became evident that Yahweh had abandoned Saul but that he was
helping David, Saul was afraid of David.
13 So he appointed David as a commander of 1,000 soldiers and sent David away
from him, hoping that David would be killed in a battle. But when David led his
soldiers in their battles,
14 he always had great success, because Yahweh was helping him.
1 SAMUEL 18:15
418
1 SAMUEL 19:1
15 When Saul heard that David and his soldiers were very successful, he became
more afraid of David.
16 But all the people of Israel and of Judah loved David, because he led the soldiers
very successfully in the battles.
David married Saul’s daughter
17 One day Saul said to David, “I am ready to give you my oldest daughter, Merab,
to be your wife. I will do that if you serve me bravely by fighting battles for Yahweh
against the Philistines”. He said that because he thought, “I will not try to get rid of
David by myself. I will allow the Philistines to do that.”
18 But David said to Saul, “I am not [RHQ] a very important person, and my family
is not very important, and my clan is not a very important Israeli clan. So I do not
deserve to become your son-in-law.” [RHQ]
19 So, when it was time for Merab to be given to David to become his wife, instead,
Saul gave her to a man named Adriel, from Meholah town.
20 But Saul’s other daughter, Michal, fell in love with David. When they told Saul
about that, he was pleased.
21 He thought, “I will let Michal marry him, in order that she may trap him, and
the Philistines will be able to kill him.” So he said to David, “You can marry Michal,”
and by saying that, he indicated for the second time that David would become his
son-in-law.
22 Saul told his servants, “Talk to David privately, and say to him, ‘Listen, the king
is pleased with you, and all of us his servants love you. So now we think that you
should marry Michal and become the king’s son-in-law.’ ”
23 So they told that to David. But David said, “It would be a great honor [RHQ] to
become the king’s son-in-law. But I do not think that I should do that, because I am
only a poor and insignificant man.”
24 When the servants told Saul what David had said,
25 Saul replied, “Go and say to David, ‘In order for the king to allow you to marry
Michal, he wants you to kill 100 Philistines and cut off their foreskins and bring the
foreskins to him to prove that you have killed them. In that way he will get revenge on
his enemies.’ ” But what Saul wanted was that the Philistines would kill David while
David was trying to kill them.
26 When the servants told that to David, he was very pleased that he could become
the king’s son-in-law by doing that. The king had said how many days he would allow
for David to do that. But before that time ended,
27 David and his men went and killed, not 100, but 200 Philistines! He brought their
foreskins to Saul, and counted them while Saul was watching, in order to prove that
he had done what the king required so that he could become Saul’s son-in-law. So then
Saul was obligated to allow David to marry his daughter Michal.
28 But when Saul realized that Yahweh was helping David, and that his daughter
loved David,
29 he became more afraid of David. So, as long as Saul lived, he was David’s enemy.
30 The Philistine armies repeatedly came to fight the Israelis, but every time they
fought, David and his soldiers were more successful than any of Saul’s other army
commanders. As a result, David became very famous.
19
Saul tried to kill David
1 Then Saul urged all his servants and his son Jonathan to kill David. But Jonathan
liked David very much.
2 So he warned David, “My father Saul is seeking for a way to kill you. So be careful.
Tomorrow morning go and find a place to hide in the field.
3 I will ask my father to go out there with me. While we are out there, I will talk to
him about you. Then I will tell you everything that he tells me.” So David did what
Jonathan told him to do.
4 The next morning, Jonathan spoke with his father, saying many good things about
David. He said, “You should never do anything to harm your servant David! He has
never done anything to harm you! Everything that he has done has helped you very
much.
5 He was in danger of being killed when he fought against Goliath, the champion
of the Philistia army. By enabling David to kill him, Yahweh won a great victory for
all the people of Israel. You were very happy when you saw that. Why would you
want to do anything now to harm David [RHQ]? There is no reason for you to kill
him, because he has not done anything wrong!”
6 Saul listened to what Jonathan said. Then Saul said, “I solemnly promise that just
as certain as Yahweh lives, I will not kill David.”
7 Afterward, Jonathan summoned David and told him what he and Saul had said.
Then Jonathan brought David to Saul, and David served Saul as he had done before.
8 One day a war started again, and David led his soldiers to fight against the Philistia
army. David’s army attacked them very furiously, with the result that the Philistia
army ran away.
9 But one day when sitting in his house, an evil spirit sent from Yahweh suddenly
came upon Saul. While David was playing his harp for Saul,
10 Saul hurled his spear at David to try to fasten him to the wall. David ◄dodged/
jumped to one side►, and the spear did not hit him. The spear stuck in the wall, but
that night David escaped.
Michal helped David escape
11 Then Saul sent messengers to David’s house.
He told them to watch the house
and to kill David while he was leaving the house the following morning. But David’s
wife Michal saw them and warned him, “To survive, you must run away tonight,
because if you do not do that, you will be killed tomorrow!”
12 So she enabled David to climb out through a window, and he ran away and
escaped.
13 Then Michal took an idol and put it in the bed. She covered it with some of
David’s clothes, and put some goat’s hair on the head of the idol.
14 When the messengers came to the house the next morning, she told them that
David was sick and could not get out of bed.
15 When they reported that to Saul, he told them to go back to David’s house. He
said to them, “Bring him to me lying on his bed, in order that I can kill him!”
16 But when those men entered David’s house, they saw that there was only an idol
in the bed, with goat’s hair on its head.
17 When they reported that to Saul, Saul summoned Michal and said to her, “Why
did you trick me like that? You allowed my enemy to escape!”
Michal replied to Saul, “David told me that if I did not help him escape, he would
kill me!” [RHQ]
Ramah. He told Samuel everything that Saul had done to try to kill him. Then David
and Samuel went to Naioth, which was a section of Ramah city, and they stayed there.
1 SAMUEL 19:19
420
1 SAMUEL 20:11
19 Someone told Saul that David was in Naioth.
20 So Saul sent some messengers to capture David. When those messengers arrived
in Ramah, they met some men who were proclaiming ecstatic messages, and Samuel
was there, as their leader. When Saul’s messengers met them, the Spirit of God took
control of Saul’s men, and they also spoke ecstatically.
21 When Saul heard about that, he sent messengers a third time, but they also
started to speak ecstatically.
22 Finally, Saul himself went to Ramah. When he arrived at the well at a place
named Secu, he asked people there, “Where are Samuel and David?”
The people replied, “They are at Naioth in Ramah city.”
23 While Saul was walking toward Naioth, the Spirit of God also took control of him.
While he walked on, he continued speaking ecstatic messages until he came to Naioth.
24 There he took off his clothes, and he spoke messages from God in front of Samuel.
He lay on the ground doing that all day and all night. That is the reason that when
people see someone doing something that is very unexpected, they think about what
happened to Saul, and they say, “We are surprised, like the people were surprised to
see Saul acting like a prophet?” [RHQ]
20
Jonathan helped David escape from Saul
1 David ran away from the Naioth section of Ramah city. He went to Jonathan and
asked him, “What have I done to displease your father? What did I do that was wrong?
Why is he trying to kill me?”
2 Jonathan replied, “My father is surely not trying to kill you! He always tells me
before he does anything that he is planning. He tells me about important things and
unimportant things that he plans to do. ◄Why would he refuse to tell me if he were
planning to kill me?/I am sure that he would not refuse to tell me if he were planning
to kill you.► [RHQ] So what you are saying cannot be true.”
3 Then David solemnly declared this to Jonathan: “Your father knows very well that
you and I are very good friends, so he says to himself, ‘I will not tell Jonathan what
I am going to do. If I tell Jonathan, he will be upset/distressed, and then he will tell
David.’ But just as certain as Yahweh lives and you live, I am only one step away
from being killed.”
4 Jonathan said to David, “I will do whatever you tell me to do.”
5 David replied, “Tomorrow we will celebrate the Festival of the New Moon. I always
eat with the king at that festival. But tomorrow I will hide in the field, and I will stay
there for one night. I will stay there until the evening of the day after tomorrow.
me to allow him to go to his home in Bethlehem, where his family will offer the
7 If your father says ‘That is okay’, then I know I will be safe. But if he becomes
8 Please be kind to me. Yahweh heard you when you made a solemn agreement
with me that you and I will always be loyal friends. If I deserve to be punished [MTY],
kill me yourself. I do not want [RHQ] you to allow your father to punish [IDM] me.”
9 Jonathan replied, “I will never do that! But if I find out that my father is
determined to harm/kill you, I will certainly warn you.” [RHQ]
10 David asked him, “How will I find out if your father answers you harshly?”
11 Jonathan replied, “Come with me. We will go out into the field.” So they went
together out into the field.
1 SAMUEL 20:12
421
1 SAMUEL 20:30
12 There Jonathan said to David, “I promise this while Yahweh, the God whom we
Israelis worship, is listening: At this time the day after tomorrow, I will find out what
my father is thinking about you. If he is saying good things about you, I will certainly
send a message to you to tell that to you [RHQ].
13 But if he is planning to hurt/kill you, I will enable you to know [IDM] that, and
enable you to go away safely. I desire that Yahweh will punish me severely if I do
not do that for you. I desire/hope that Yahweh will be with you and help you like he
has helped my father.
14 But while I am still alive, please be kind to me in the same way that Yahweh is
kind to me, and do not kill me when you become king.
15 But if I die, never stop being kind to my family, even after Yahweh has gotten rid
of all your enemies all over the earth.”
16 David agreed. So Jonathan made a solemn agreement with David. And he said,
“I hope/desire that Yahweh will get rid of all your enemies.”
17 And Jonathan requested David to repeat his solemn promise to be his close friend,
because Jonathan loved David as much as he loved himself.
18 Then Jonathan said, “Tomorrow we will celebrate the Festival of the New Moon.
When you are not sitting at your place when we eat, my father will ◄miss you/see
that you are not there►.
19 The day after tomorrow, in the evening, go to the place where you hid before.
Wait by the pile of stones.
20 I will come out and shoot three arrows as though I were trying to shoot at a
target. The arrows will hit the ground close to the pile of stones.
21 Then I will send a boy to bring the arrows back to me. If you hear me say to him,
‘They are closer to me’, then as surely as Yahweh lives, you will know that everything
is fine, and that Saul will not kill you.
22 But if I tell him, ‘The arrows are farther away’, you will know that you must
leave immediately, because Yahweh wants you to run away.
23 I hope/desire that Yahweh will watch you and me and enable us to never forget
what we have promised each other.”
24 So David went and hid in the field. When the Festival of the New Moon started,
the king sat down to eat.
25 He sat where he usually sat, close to the wall. Jonathan sat across from him,
and Abner the army commander sat next to Saul. But no one was sitting in the place
26 On that day, Saul did not say anything about David, because he was thinking,
worship God.”
Saul asked Jonathan, “Why has that son of Jesse not been here to eat with us yesterday
and today?”
28 Jonathan replied, “David earnestly requested me that I permit him to go to
Bethlehem.
29 He said, ‘Please allow me to go, because our family is going to offer a sacrifice.
My older brother insisted that I be there. So please allow me to go to be with my older
brothers.’ I allowed David to go, and that is the reason that he is not here eating with
you.”
30 Saul was ◄furious/very angry► with Jonathan. He yelled at him, “You stupid
bastard [EUP]! I know that you are being loyal to that son of Jesse. By doing that, you
will bring shame to yourself and to your mother.
1 SAMUEL 20:31
422
1 SAMUEL 21:6
31 As long as Jesse’s son is living, you will never become the king, and you will
never rule over a kingdom! So now, summon David, and bring him to me. He must
be executed!”
32 Jonathan asked his father, “Why should David be executed? What wrong has he
done?”
33 Then Saul threw his spear at Jonathan in order to kill him, but the spear did not
hit him. So Jonathan knew that his father really wanted to kill David.
34 Jonathan was very angry, and he left the room. On that second day of the festival,
he refused to eat anything. He was disgusted about what his father had done, and he
was worried about David.
35 The following morning Jonathan went out to the field to give a message to David,
like he had agreed that he would do. He took a young boy with him.
36 Jonathan said to the boy, “Run and find the arrows that I shoot.” The boy started
running, and Jonathan shot an arrow ahead of the boy.
37 When the boy ran to the place where the arrow hit the ground, Jonathan called
out, “The arrow is further away!” [RHQ]
38 Then he shouted to the boy, “Act quickly; do not wait! Do not stop!” The boy
picked up the arrow and brought it back to Jonathan.
39 But the boy did not understand the meaning of what Jonathan had said; only
Jonathan and David knew.
40 Then Jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy and told him, “Go back to the
town.”
41 When the boy left, David came out from the south side of the pile of stones behind
which he had been hiding. He went to Jonathan and bowed in front of Jonathan three
times, with his face touching the ground. Then David and Jonathan kissed each other
on the cheek/neck, and they cried together. But David cried more than Jonathan.
42 Jonathan said to David, “May things go well for you as you go. Yahweh has heard
what we solemnly promised to always do for each other, and what we said that our
descendants must do for each other.” Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the
town.
21
trembled when he saw David because he was afraid that something bad had happened.
He said to David, “Why are you alone? Why have no men come with you?”
2 David deceived Ahimelech by replying, “The king sent me. But he does not want
anyone to know anything about what he sent me to do. I have told my men where
they should meet me.
3 Now I want to know, do you have any food here for me to eat [IDM]? Could you
give me five loaves of bread, or whatever other food that you can find?”
4 The priest answered David, “There is no ordinary bread here, but I have some of
the sacred bread that was placed before Yahweh. Your men may eat it if they have
not slept with [EUP] women recently.”
5 David replied, “They have not been near women for many days. I do not allow
my men to defile themselves by sleeping with women while they are preparing to
fight in battles. They must continue to keep themselves acceptable to God when they
are on ordinary trips, and today they have kept themselves acceptable to God because
now we are doing something very special/important.”
6 The only bread that the priest had was the sacred bread that had been placed in
Yahweh’s presence in the Sacred tent. So the priest gave David some of that bread.
1 SAMUEL 21:7
423
1 SAMUEL 22:6
On that day the priest had taken those loaves from the table and replaced them with
◄fresh/newly baked► loaves.
7 It happened that Doeg, from the Edom people-group, was there on that day to
make himself acceptable to Yahweh, and he saw what Ahimelech did. He was one of
Saul’s officials and the leader of Saul’s shepherds.
8 David asked Ahimelech, “Do you have a spear or a sword that I could use? The
king appointed us to do this task and told us to leave immediately, so I did not have
time to bring any weapons.”
9 Ahimelech replied, “I have only the sword that belonged to Goliath the giant from
the Philistia people-group whom you killed in Elah Valley. It is wrapped in a cloth,
and is behind the sacred vest in the Sacred Tent. If you want it, take it, because I have
no other weapon here.”
David replied, “Truly, there is no other sword that is as good as that one! Give it to
me.”
10 So Ahimelech gave it to him, and David left there. He and his men and went to
Gath city in the Philistia region, to stay with King Achish.
11 But the officers of King Achish objected to David being there. They said to King
Achish, “This man is [RHQ] David, the king of Israel! He is the one [RHQ] whom our
enemies, the Israeli people, honored by dancing and singing,
but David has killed tens of thousands of them!’ ”
might do to him.
13 So he pretended that he was insane. He started scratching on the gates of the city
and allowing his saliva to run down his beard.
14 Then King Achish said to his men, “Look at this man! He is acting like an insane
man! Why have you brought him to me?
15 Have you brought him because I do not have enough insane men here already
[RHQ]? I do not want [RHQ] him to come into my house!”
22
David and his men hid in a cave at Adullam
1 David and his men left Gath and went east to hide in a cave on a hill at Adullam
city. Soon his older brothers and all his other relatives came and stayed with him
there.
2 Then other men came there. Some were men who had caused trouble, some were
men who owed money, and some were men who were not content [IDM] with the
government. They continued to come until there were 400 men there, and David was
their leader.
3 Later they left there and went east to Mizpah city in the Moab region. There David
requested the king of Moab, “Please allow my father and mother to live here with
you until I know what God is going to do for me.”
4 The king gave him permission, so David’s parents stayed with the king of Moab all
the time that David and the men who were with him were hiding in that area.
5 One day the prophet Gad told David, “Leave ◄your fortress/this area► and return
to Judah.” So David and his men went to Hereth forest in Judah.
Saul killed Ahimelech and many other priests
6 One day, someone told Saul that David and his men had arrived in Judah. On that
day, Saul was sitting underneath the tamarisk tree on a hill at Gibeah town. He was
holding his spear, and was surrounded by his army officers.
1 SAMUEL 22:7
424
1 SAMUEL 23:1
7 He shouted to them, “You men of the tribe of Benjamin, listen to me! Do you think
that the son of Jesse will give all of you fields and vineyards if he becomes your king?
Will he appoint all of you to become generals and captains in his army [RHQ]?
8 Is that why you have all conspired against me [RHQ]? None of you told me when
my son Jonathan made a solemn agreement with that son of Jesse. None of you feels
sorry for me. That son of Jesse was my servant, but now my son is encouraging him
to hide in order to ◄ambush me/attack me suddenly►, as he is doing today!”
9 Doeg, a man from the Edom people-group, was standing there with Saul’s officers.
He said to Saul, “When I was at Nob, I saw that son of Jesse talking to Ahimelech, the
priest.
10 Ahimelech asked Yahweh what David should do. Then Ahimelech gave to David
some food and the sword of Goliath, the giant from the Philistia people-group.”
11 Then Saul summoned Ahimelech and all Ahimelech’s relatives who were priests
12 Saul said to Ahimelech, “You son of Ahitub, listen to me!”
13 Saul said, “Why are you and Jesse’s son conspiring to get rid of me? You gave him
some bread and a sword. You requested God to tell David what he should do. David
has rebelled against me, and right now he is hiding somewhere, waiting to attack me.”
14 Ahimelech replied, “I do not understand why you are saying that, because David,
your son-in-law, the captain of your bodyguards, is very loyal to you. No one is more
loyal to you than David! Everyone in your household respects him very much.
15 Furthermore, this was certainly not [RHQ] the first time that I requested God to
say what he wanted David to do. And it is not right for you to accuse me or any of
my relatives of trying to get rid of you, because I do not know anything about anyone
wanting to do that.”
16 The king then shouted, “Ahimelech, you and your all your relatives are going to
be executed right now!”
17 Then he commanded his bodyguards, “Kill these priests of Yahweh, because they
are allies of David, and they are conspiring with David against me! They knew that
David was trying to run away from me, but they did not tell me!”
But Saul’s bodyguards refused to kill Yahweh’s priests.
18 Then the king said to Doeg, “You kill them!” So Doeg, the man from the Edom
people-group, went out and struck them with his sword. On that day he killed eightyfive men who were wearing the sacred vests because they were God’s priests.
19 He also went and killed many people in Nob, the city where the priests lived. He
killed men, women, children, babies, cattle, donkeys, and sheep there.
20 But Abiathar, Ahimelech’s son, escaped. He ran away and joined David and the
21 He told David that Saul had commanded Doeg to kill Yahweh’s priests.
22 Then David said to him, “That man from the Edom people-group, Doeg, was
there at Nob on the day that I was there. I knew that he would surely tell Saul what
happened. So it is my fault that your father and all of his family have been killed.
23 You stay with me, and do not be afraid. The man who wants to kill you wants to
kill me also, but you will be safe if you stay with me.”
23
David saved the people of Keilah
1 One day someone told David, “You need to know that the Philistia army is attacking
Keilah town and they are stealing grain from where men are threshing it.”
1 SAMUEL 23:2
425
1 SAMUEL 23:20
2 David asked Yahweh, “Should my men and I go to fight against those men from
the Philistia people-group?”
Yahweh answered, “Yes, go. Attack them, and rescue the people of Keilah.”
3 But David’s men said to him, “We are afraid that Saul will attack us here in Judah.
We will be more afraid if we go to Keilah where the Philistia army is!”
4 So David asked Yahweh again if they should go to Keilah. Yahweh answered, “Yes,
go down to Keilah. I will help you to defeat the men of the Philistia people-group.”
5 So David and his men went to Keilah. They fought against the men of the Philistia
people-group and captured many of their cattle. David and his men killed many of
the Philistia men and rescued the people of Keilah.
6 Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, fled to be with David at Keilah, and he brought
the sacred vest with him to use it to determine what God wanted to be done.
enabling me to capture him! He has trapped himself in that town, because it has high
8 So Saul summoned his army, and they prepared to go down to Keilah to attack
David and his men.
9 But David found out that Saul was planning for his army to attack him. So he said
to Abiathar the priest, “Bring here the sacred vest.”
10 So when Abiathar brought it, David prayed, “Yahweh, God of us Israelis, I have
heard that Saul is planning to come here with his army and destroy Keilah because I
am here.
11 Will Saul come down here to Keilah, as people reported to me? Will the leaders
of Keilah enable Saul to capture me? Yahweh, God of us Israelis, please tell me!”
Yahweh answered, “Yes, Saul will come down.”
12 Then David asked, “Will the leaders of Keilah enable Saul’s army to capture me
and my men if we stay here?”
By means of the stones in the sacred vest, Yahweh replied, “Yes, they will.”
13 So David and his 600 men left Keilah. They continued to move from one place to
another, wherever they thought that Saul would not find them. And when Saul found
out that David had escaped from Keilah, he did not go there.
14 David and his men stayed in hiding places in the desert and in the hills of Ziph
Desert. Every day Saul sent men to search for David, but Yahweh did not allow them
to capture David.
15 While David and his men were at a place named Horesh in Ziph desert, he found
out that Saul was coming there to kill him.
16 But Saul’s son Jonathan went to David at Horesh, and encouraged him to continue
to trust God.
17 Jonathan told him, “Do not be afraid, because my father will not be able to harm
[IDM] you. Some day you will be the king of Israel, and I will be the second most
important man in Israel. My father Saul also knows that.”
them make previously, that they would always be loyal to each other. Then Jonathan
went home, but David stayed at Horesh.
19 Some people from Ziph went to Saul when he was at Gibeah, and they told him,
“David and his men are hiding in our land [RHQ]! They are hiding in places at Horesh
on Hakilah Hill, south of a place named Jeshimon.
20 So, O king, come down there any time that you want to. It is our duty to capture
him and turn him over to you.”
1 SAMUEL 23:21
426
1 SAMUEL 24:10
21 Saul replied, “I hope/desire that Yahweh will bless you for telling that to me.
22 Go back and find out more about him. Find out exactly where he is staying, and
find out who has seen him there. People tell me that he is very clever, so we need to
be clever also to be able to capture him.
23 Find out all the places where he and his men hide. Then come back and tell me
everything that you have found out. Then I will take my army and go there with you.
24 So those people went back to Ziph before Saul went there. At that time David
25 Saul and his soldiers went to search for David, but David heard about that. So he
heard about that, he and his men followed David and his men to the Maon Desert.
his men were on the other side. David and his men were hurrying to escape from
Saul’s soldiers, because Saul and his soldiers were coming much closer.
27 But then a messenger came to Saul and said to him, “Come quickly! The Philistia
army is attacking the people in our land!”
28 So Saul stopped pursuing David, and he and his soldiers went to fight against the
Philistia army. That is the reason that people call that place ‘Escape Rock’.
29 David and his men also left the Maon Desert and went to places to hide safely at
En-Gedi.
24
David spared Saul’s life
1 After Saul and his soldiers returned home after fighting against the Philistia army,
someone reported to Saul that David and his men had gone into the desert near EnGedi.
2 When Saul heard that, he chose 3,000 men from various areas in Israel, and they
went to search for David and his men at a place named Rocks of Wild Goats.
3 At a place where the road was alongside some sheep pens, Saul left the road and
entered a cave to defecate [EUP]. He did not know that David and his men were hiding
further inside that same cave!
4 David’s men saw Saul and whispered to David, “Today is the day that Yahweh
spoke about when he said, ‘I will enable you to defeat your enemy.’ You can do to
him whatever you want to!” So David crept toward the entrance of the cave and with
his knife he cut off a piece of Saul’s robe.
5 And then he returned to his men.
But then David felt guilty for having cut off a piece of Saul’s robe.
6 He said to his men, “I should not have done that to the king! I hope/desire that
Yahweh will never allow me to attack the one whom God has appointed, because
Yahweh is the one who chose him to be the king.”
7 By saying that, David restrained his men, and did not allow them to kill Saul.
8 After Saul left the cave and started to walk on the road again, David came out of
the cave and shouted to Saul, “King Saul!” Saul turned around and looked, and David
bowed down with his face touching the ground.
9 Then he said to Saul, “◄Why do you pay attention to people when they say ‘David
wants to harm you’?/You should not pay attention to people when they say ‘David
wants to harm you’.► [RHQ]
10 Today you can see with your own eyes that what they say is not true. Yahweh
put you in a place where my men and I could have killed you when you were in this
1 SAMUEL 24:11
427
1 SAMUEL 25:6
cave. Some of my men told me that I should do that, but I did not do that. I said to
them, ‘I will not harm my master, because he is the king whom Yahweh appointed.’
11 Your majesty, look at this piece of your robe that is in my hand! I cut it from
not planning to do anything evil to you. I have not done anything wrong to you, but
12 I hope/desire that Yahweh will judge and decide which of us ◄is doing what is
right/pleases him►. And I hope/desire that he will punish you for the wrong things
that you have done to me. But I will not try to harm you.
13 There is a proverb that has the words, ‘Evil things are done by evil people.’ But
I am not evil, so I will not do evil things to you.
14 “You are the king of Israel. So ◄why are you pursuing me?/you should not be
pursuing me.► [RHQ] I am as harmless as [MET] a dead dog or a flea.
15 I hope/desire that Yahweh will judge which of us is doing what ◄he wants/is
right►. I trust that he will act like a lawyer and judge ◄my case/what I have done►,
and that he will rescue me from your power [MTY].”
16 When David finished speaking, Saul called out to him and asked, “My son David,
is that your voice that I am hearing?” Then he began to cry loudly.
17 He said, “You are a better man than I am. You have done something very good
to me when I tried to do something very bad to you.
18 When Yahweh put me in a place in that cave where you could have easily killed
me, you did not do that.
19 ◄Who else would/No one else would► find his enemy and allow his enemy to
escape when he could kill him instead [RHQ]. I hope/desire that Yahweh will reward
you for being kindly to me today.
20 I know that some day you will surely become the king, and that your kingdom
will prosper as you rule the Israeli people.
21 Now while Yahweh is listening, solemnly promise to me that you will not kill my
family and get rid of all my descendants.”
22 David solemnly promised Saul that he would not harm Saul’s family. Then Saul
went back home, and David and his men went back up into the place where they had
been hiding.
25
Samuel died
1 Soon after that, Samuel died, and all the Israeli people gathered and mourned for
him. They buried his body outside his home in Ramah.
Nabal insulted David
Then David and his men moved to the Maon Desert.
2 In Maon town there was a man who owned land in Carmel, a nearby village. He
was very rich; he owned 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats.
3 His name was Nabal; he was a descendant of Caleb. His wife Abigail was a wise
and beautiful woman, but Nabal was very cruel and treated people very unkindly
[IDM].
4 One day while David and his men were in the desert, someone told him that Nabal
was cutting the wool from his sheep.
5 So David told ten of his men, “Go to Nabal at Carmel and greet him for me.
6 Then tell to him this message from me, ‘I wish/desire that things will go well for
you and your family and for everything that you possess.
1 SAMUEL 25:7
428
when your shepherds were among us, we did not harm them. All the time that your
8 You can ask your servants if this is true, and they will tell you that it is true. We
have come here at a time when you are celebrating, so I ask you to please be kind to
us and give these men whatever extra food you have, for me, David, and my men to
eat.’ ”
9 When David’s men arrived where Nabal was, they gave David’s message to him,
and they waited for him to reply. But Nabal spoke harshly to them.
10 He said to them, “Who does this man, this son of Jesse, think that he is? [DOU,
RHQ] There are many slaves who are running away from their masters at the present
time, and it seems to me that he is just one of them.
11 I give bread and water to the men who are cutting the wool from my sheep, and
I give them meat from animals that I have slaughtered. Why should I take some of
those things and give them to a group of outlaws [RHQ]? ◄Who knows where they
have come from?/I do not even know where they have come from.►” [RHQ]
12 Then David’s men returned and told him what Nabal had said.
13 When David heard that, he told his men, “We are going to kill Nabal; fasten your
swords!” So he fastened on his sword and about 400 men fastened on their swords
and went with David. There were 200 of his men who stayed with their supplies.
14 One of Nabal’s servants found out what David and his men were planning to do,
so he went to Nabal’s wife Abigail and said to her, “David sent some messengers from
the desert to greet our master Nabal, but Nabal only yelled at them.
15 All the time that we were in the fields close to them, those men of David were
very kind to us. They did not harm us. They did not steal anything from us.
16 They protected us during the daytime and during the night. They were like a
wall [MET] around us to protect us while we were taking care of our sheep.
17 So now you should think about it and decide what you can do. If you do not do
something, terrible things will happen to our master and to all his family. Nabal is an
extremely wicked man, with the result that he will not heed anyone when that person
tries to tell him anything that he should do.”
18 When Abigail heard that, she very quickly gathered 200 loaves of bread, and also
got two leather bags full of wine, the meat from five sheep, a bushel of roasted grain,
100 packs of raisins, and 200 packs of dried figs. She put all those things on donkeys.
19 Then she told her servants, “Go ahead of me. I will follow you.” But she did not
tell her husband what she was going to do.
20 David and his men had left the place where they were staying and were on the
road to Nabal’s property. They were coming down a hill when they met Abigail.
21 David had been saying to his men, “It was useless for us to protect that man and
all his possessions here in this desert. We did not steal anything that belonged to him,
but he has done evil to me in return for our good things we did for him.

before him, with her face touching the ground.
punished for what my husband has done. Please listen to what I say to you.
25 Please do not pay attention to [IDM] what this worthless man Nabal has said. His
servant, did not see the messengers whom you sent to him.
1 SAMUEL 25:26
429
1 SAMUEL 25:43
26 Yahweh has prevented you from getting revenge on anyone and killing anyone.
I hope/desire that as surely as Yahweh lives and as surely as you live, your enemies
will be cursed like Nabal will be.
27 I have brought a gift for you and for the men who are with you.
28 Please forgive me if I have done anything wrong to you. Yahweh will surely
reward you by allowing many of your descendants to become kings of Israel, because
you are fighting the battles that Yahweh wants you to fight. And I know that
throughout all your life you have not done anything wrong.
29 Even when those who are trying to kill you pursue you, you are safe, because
Yahweh your God takes care of you. You will be protected as though you were [MET]
a bundle that he has safely tied up. But your enemies will disappear as fast as stones
that are hurled from a sling.
30 Yahweh has promised to do good things for you, and he will do what he has
promised. And he will cause you to become the ruler of the Israeli people.
31 When that happens, you will be glad that you did not kill any people in Nabal’s
household. You will not think that you deserve to be punished for having taken
revenge yourself and killed innocent people. And when Yahweh enables you to
successfully become the king, please do not forget to be kind to me.”
32 David replied to Abigail, “I praise Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship,
because he sent you to talk with me.
33 I hope/desire that Yahweh will bless you for being very wise. You have prevented
34 Just as surely as Yahweh the God whom we Israelis worship is alive, he has
Nabal nor even one of Nabal’s men [IDM] would be still alive tomorrow morning.”
35 Then David accepted the gifts that Abigail had brought to him. He said to her, “I
hope/desire that things will go well for you. I have heard what you said, and I will
do what you have requested.”
Nabal died
36 When Abigail returned to Nabal, he was in his house, having a big celebration
like kings have. He was very drunk and feeling very happy. So Abigail did not say
anything to him that night about her meeting with David.
37 The next morning, when he was no longer drunk, she told him everything that
had happened when she talked with David. Immediately ◄he had a stroke/a blood
vessel burst in his brain► and he became paralyzed [MET].
38 About ten days later Yahweh struck him again and he died.
39 After David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Praise Yahweh! Nabal insulted
me, but Yahweh ◄vindicated me/got revenge for me►. He has prevented me from
doing anything wrong. And he has punished Nabal for the wrong that he did.”
David married Abigail
Then David sent messengers to Abigail, to ask her if she would become his wife.
40 His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail, “David sent us to take you to
become his wife.”
41 Abigail bowed down with her face touching the ground. Then she told the
And I am willing to wash the feet of your slaves.”
42 Abigail quickly got on her donkey and went with David’s messengers. Five of
her maids went with her. When she arrived where David was, she became his wife.
43 David had previously married Ahinoam, a woman from Jezreel town near Carmel.
So both Abigail and Ahinoam were now David’s wives.
430
1 SAMUEL 26:16
44 King Saul’s daughter Michal was also David’s wife, but Saul had given her to
Laish’s son Paltiel, who was from Gallim town.
26
David spared Saul’s life again
1 One day some of the people of Ziph town went to Saul while he was at Gibeah,
town.”
2 So Saul chose 3,000 of the best Israeli soldiers and went with them to Ziph Desert
to search for David.
3 Saul and his men set up their tents close to the road on Hakilah hill, east of
Jeshimon town, but David and his men stayed in the desert. When David heard that
Saul was searching for him,
4 he sent some spies to find out for certain that Saul had come to Hakilah.
5 Then that evening David went to the place where Saul had set up his tent. From
a distance he saw where Saul and his army commander, Abner, were sleeping. Saul
was sleeping with all his army sleeping around him.
6 David went back to where his men were and talked to Ahimelech, who was from
the Heth people-group, and Joab’s brother Abishai, whose mother was David’s older
sister Zeruiah. He asked them, “Who will go with me down into the camp where Saul
is?”
Abishai replied, “I will go with you.”
7 So that night David and Abishai crept into Saul’s camp. They saw that Saul was
asleep. His spear was stuck in the ground near his head. Saul was asleep in the middle
of the camp. Abner the army commander and the other soldiers were sleeping around
Saul.
Allow me to fasten Saul to the ground by thrusting my spear into him. It will be
9 But David whispered to Abishai, “No, do not kill Saul. Yahweh has appointed him
10 Just as surely as Yahweh lives, he himself will punish Saul. Perhaps Yahweh will
strike him when it is Saul’s time to die, or perhaps Saul will be killed in a battle.
11 But I hope/desire that Yahweh will prevent me from harming the king whom he
has appointed. Let’s take Saul’s spear and water jug that are near his head. Then
let’s get out of here!”
David taunted Abner and Saul
12 So David took the spear and the jug, and he and Abishai left. No one saw them
or knew what they were doing, and no one woke up, because Yahweh had caused
them to be sound asleep.
13 David and Abishai went across the valley and climbed to the top of the hill, a
long way from Saul’s camp.
14 Then David shouted to Abner, “Abner, can you hear me?”
him?”
why did you not guard your master, the king? Someone came into your camp in order
16 You have done a very poor job of guarding Saul. So just as surely as Yahweh
lives, you and your men should be executed! You have not guarded your master
1 SAMUEL 26:17
431
1 SAMUEL 27:7
whom Yahweh appointed to be the king. Where are the king’s spear and the water
jug that were close to his head?”
17 The shouting woke Saul up and he recognized that it was David’s voice. He called
out, saying, “My son David, is that your voice?”
David replied, “Yes, your majesty it is my voice.”
18 Then David added, “Sir, why are you pursuing me [RHQ]? What wrong have I
done [RHQ]?
19 Your majesty, listen to me! If Yahweh has caused you to be angry with me, I
should offer a sacrifice in order to appease him. But if it is people who have caused
you to be angry with me, I hope/desire that Yahweh will curse them. They have forced
me to leave the land that Yahweh gave to me. They have told me, ‘Go somewhere
else and worship other gods!’
20 Now do not force me to die [MTY] far from where we worship Yahweh. You, the
king of Israel, have come here searching for me. But I do not want to harm you! I am
as harmless as a flea [MET]. You are searching for me like people hunt for a bird in
the mountains! [MET]”
21 Then Saul said, “David, my son. I have sinned by trying to kill you. So come back
home. Today you have considered my life to be very valuable and so you have not
killed me. So I will not try to harm you. I have made a big mistake and have acted
foolishly.”
22 David replied, “ will leave your spear here. Send one of your young men here to
get it.
23 Yahweh rewards us for the things that we do that are right and for being loyal to
him. Even when Yahweh placed me where I could easily have killed you, I refused to
do that, because you are the one whom Yahweh has appointed [MTY] to be the king.
24 Just like I considered your life to be valuable and spared your life today, I hope/
desire that Yahweh will consider my life to be valuable and spare my life and save me
from all my troubles.”
25 Then Saul said to David, “My son David, I pray that Yahweh will bless you. You
will do great things very successfully.”
Then David returned to his men, and Saul went back home.
27
David stayed among the Philistia people-group
1 But David thought, “Some day Saul will capture me if I stay around here.
So the
best thing that I can do is to escape and go to the Philistia area. If I do that, Saul will
stop searching for me here in Israel, and I will be safe.”
2 So David and his 600 men left Israel and went to see Maoch’s son Achish, who
was king of Gath city in the Philistia area.
3 David and his men and their families started to live there in Gath, the city where
king Achish lived. David’s two wives were with him—Ahinoam from Jezreel, and
Nabal’s widow Abigail, from Carmel.
4 When someone told Saul that David had run away and was living in Gath, he
stopped searching for David.
5 One day David said to Achish, “If you are pleased with us, give us a place in one
of the small villages where we can stay. There is no need [RHQ] for us to stay in the
city where you are the king.”
6 Achish liked what David suggested. So that day Achish gave to David Ziklag town.
As a result, Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah since that time.
7 David and his men lived in the Philistia area for 16 months.
1 SAMUEL 27:8
432
1 SAMUEL 28:9
8 During that time David and his men raided the people who lived in the areas where
the Geshur, Girzi, and Amalek people-groups lived. Those people had lived there a
long time. That area extended south from Telam to the Shur Desert and to the border
of Egypt.
9 Whenever David’s men attacked them, they killed all the men and women, and
they took all the people’s sheep and cattle and donkeys and camels, and even their
clothes. Then they would bring those things back home, and David would go to talk
to Achish.
10 Each time Achish would ask David, “Where did you go raiding today?” David
would lie to him. Sometimes he would reply that they had gone to the southern part
of Judah, and sometimes he would say that they had gone to Jerahmeel, or to the area
where the Ken people-group lived.
David thought, “If we do not kill everyone, some of them who are still alive will go and
and his men lived in the Philistia area.
David has done, his own people, the Israelis, must now hate him very much. So he
will have to stay here and serve me forever.”
Saul consulted a witch/medium
28
1 Some time later, the people of Philistia gathered their army to attack the Israelis
again. King Achish told David, “I am expecting that you and your men will join with
my men to attack the Israelis.”
2 David replied, “We will go with you, and then you will see for yourself what we
can do!”
Achish said, “Okay, I will appoint you to be my bodyguard permanently.”
3 While Samuel was still alive, Saul did many things that pleased Yahweh. One of the
good things that Saul did was to expel from Israel all the people who were fortunetellers or who talked to the spirits of dead people. But Samuel had died, and all
the Israeli people had mourned for him. Then they had buried him in Ramah, his
hometown. After that, Saul did not try to please Yahweh any more.
4 The army of Philistia gathered and set up their tents at Shunem city, in the north
of Israel. Saul gathered the Israeli army and set up their tents at Gilboa in the eastern
part of the same valley.
5 When Saul saw the army of Philistia, he became so afraid that his heart pounded/
shook.
6 He prayed to Yahweh, but Yahweh did not answer him. Yahweh did not tell Saul
what he should do by giving him a dream, or by having the priest throw the marked
stones that were in his sacred vest, or by giving a message about Saul to any prophet.
7 Then Saul said to his servants, “Find for me a woman who talks to the spirits
of dead people, in order that I can ask her what will happen.” His servants replied,
“There is a woman in Endor town who does that.”
8 So Saul took off the clothes that showed that he was the king, and he put on ordinary
clothes ◄to disguise himself/so that people would not recognize who he was►. Then
he and two of his men went during the night to talk to that woman. Saul said to her,
“I want you to talk to a spirit of someone who has died. Cause to appear the person
whose name I will give to you.”
9 But the woman replied, “You surely know what Saul has done. He expelled from
this land all the people who talk to spirits of dead people and all fortune-tellers. I think
1 SAMUEL 28:10
433
1 SAMUEL 28:25
that you are trying to trap me, in order that I will be executed for doing something
that is not permitted.”
10 Saul replied, solemnly asking Yahweh to listen to what he was saying, “Just as
surely as Yahweh lives, you will not be punished for doing this.”
Saul replied, “Cause Samuel to appear.”
12 So the woman did that. But when she saw Samuel, she screamed. She said, “You
have tricked me [RHQ]! You are Saul! You will execute me for doing this!”
13 Saul said to her, “Do not be afraid. What do you see?”
The woman said, “I see a god/spirit coming up out of the ground.”
14 Saul said, “What does he look like?”
The woman replied, “An old man wearing a robe is appearing.”
Then Saul knew that it was Samuel. So he bowed down with his face touching the
ground.
15 Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you bothered/disturbed me by causing me to
appear?”
Saul said, “I am very worried. The army of Philistia is about to attack my army,
and God has abandoned me. He does not answer my questions any more. He does
not give me dreams to tell me what to do or give messages to prophets to tell me what
to do. That is the reason that I came to see you. So you tell me what I should do!”
16 Samuel said, “Yahweh has abandoned you and has become your enemy. So why
do you ask me what you should do? [RHQ]
17 He has done what he told me previously that he would do to you. He has torn the
kingdom away from you, and he is giving it to someone who is another Israeli—David.
18 You did not obey Yahweh. Yahweh was very angry with the Amalek people-group.
You did not kill all of their animals, with the result that you did not show that he was
very angry with them. That is the reason that he has done this to you today.
19 Yahweh will enable the Philistia army to defeat you and all the other Israeli
soldiers. And tomorrow you and your sons will be with me in the place where spirits
of dead people are. Yahweh will cause the whole Israeli army to be defeated by the
Philistia army.” And after Samuel said that, he disappeared.
20 Saul immediately fell flat on the ground. He was so afraid because of what
Samuel had said that he became paralyzed. He was also very weak because he had
not eaten anything all that day and night.
21 The woman saw that he was extremely worried/terrified. She said to him, “Listen
to me! I have done what you requested me to do. I could be executed for doing that.
22 So now please pay attention to what I say. Allow me to give you some food, in
order that you will eat it and get enough strength to go back to your army.”
23 But Saul refused. He said, “No, I will not eat anything.” Then Saul’s servants also
urged him to eat something, and finally he heeded what they said. He got up from
the ground and sat on the bed.
24 The woman had a fat calf close to her house. She quickly slaughtered it and
putting in any yeast.
Then that night they got up and left.
29
The king of Philistia sent David back home
1 SAMUEL 29:1
434
1 SAMUEL 30:5
1 The Philistia army gathered at Aphek Valley, which is near Shunem.
The Israelis
set up their tents at Jezreel city, which was in the same valley.
2 The kings of Philistia divided their men into groups; some groups had 100 soldiers
and some groups had 1,000 soldiers. David and his men were marching behind, with
King Achish.
3 But the Philistia commanders asked, “What are these Hebrews doing here,
marching with us to battle?”
Achish replied, “Their leader is David. He previously worked for King Saul of Israel,
but now he has been living near me for more than a year. During all the time since
he left Saul, I have not seen/found that he has any faults.”
4 But the Philistia army commanders were angry with Achish for allowing David’s
army to be going with them. They said to him, “Send David and his men back to the
city that you gave to him! We do not want him to go with us into the battle. If he
goes with us, we will have an enemy in our own midst! He would please King Saul
by killing our own soldiers [RHQ]!
5 Have you forgotten that David is the one about whom the Israelis dance and sing,
saying,
‘Saul has killed 1000 of our enemies,
but David has killed 10,000 of them!’?”
6 So Achish summoned David, and said to him, “Just as surely as Yahweh lives, you
have been loyal to me. I would like very much for you to fight along with my army.
Since the day that you came to me, I have not found/seen that you have any faults.
But the other Philistia rulers do not trust you.
7 So all of you go back home, and I hope/desire that things will go well for you. I do
not want you(sg) to do anything that the other rulers of Philistia will not be pleased
with.”
8 David replied, “What wrong have I done? Since the day that I first came to you
until today, have I done anything that you think is evil? Your majesty, why will you
not allow me to go and fight against your enemies?”
9 Achish replied, “I know that you are as just as good as an angel from God. But
the commanders of my army have said, ‘We will not allow David and his men to go
with us into the battle.’
10 So early tomorrow morning you and your men must leave. Get up as soon as it
is light and leave.”
11 So David and his men got up early the following morning and returned to the
area where the Philistia people lived. And the Philistia army went up to Jezreel.
30
David’s army defeated the Amalekites
Judah. They had destroyed Ziklag and burned down all the buildings.
2 They had captured the women and the children and everyone else, and had taken
them away. But they had not killed anyone.
3 When David and his men came to Ziklag, they saw that the town had been burned,
and that their wives and sons and daughters had been captured and taken away.
4 David and his men cried loudly, until they were so weak that they could not cry
any more.
5 David’s two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, had also been taken away.
1 SAMUEL 30:6
435
1 SAMUEL 30:21
6 David’s men were threatening to kill him by throwing stones at him, because they
were very angry because their sons and daughters had been taken away. David was
very distressed, but Yahweh his God gave him strength.
7 David did not know what to do, so he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring to me the
sacred vest.” So Abiathar brought it,
8 and David asked Yahweh, “Should I and my men pursue the men who took our
families? Will we be able to catch up to them?”
Yahweh answered by means of the stones in Abiathar’s sacred pouch, “Yes, pursue
them. You will catch up to them, and you will be able to rescue your families.”
9 So David and the 600 men who were with him left, and they came to the Besor
Ravine. Some of his men stayed there with some of their supplies.
10 David and 400 men continued to pursue the men who captured their families. The
other 200 men stayed there at the ravine, because they were so exhausted that they
could not cross the ravine.
11 As David and the 400 men were going, they saw a man from Egypt in a field; so
they took him to David. They gave the man some water to drink and some food to
eat.
12 They also gave him a piece of fig cake and two clusters/packs of raisins. The man
had not had anything to eat or drink for three days and nights, but after he ate and
drank he felt refreshed.
13 David asked him, “Who is your master? And where do you come from?”
He replied, “I am from Egypt. I am a slave of a man from the Amalek people-group.
Three days ago my master left me here, because I was sick and I was not able to go
with them.
14 We had raided the southern part of Judah where the Kereth people-group
live, and some other towns in Judah, and the area south of Hebron city where the
descendants of Caleb live. We also burned Ziklag town.”
15 David asked him, “Can you lead us to this group of raiders?”
He replied, “Yes, I will do that if you ask God to listen while you promise that you
will not kill me or give me back to my master. If you promise that, I will take you to
them.”
16 David agreed to do that, so the man from Egypt led David and his men to where
eating and drinking and celebrating because of having captured many things from
17 David and his men fought against them from sunset that day until the evening
none of the others escaped.
18 David rescued his two wives, and he and his men got back everything else that
the men of the Amalek people-group had taken.
19 Nothing was missing. They took all their people back to Ziklag—young people
and old people, their wives, their sons and their daughters. They also recovered all
the other things that the men of the Amalek people-group had taken from Ziklag.
20 They took with them the sheep and cattle that had been captured, and his men
caused those animals to go in front of them, saying, “These are animals that we
captured in the battle; they belong to David!”
21 David and his men got back to where the other 200 men were waiting, the men
who did not go with David because they were very exhausted. They had stayed at
Besor Ravine. When they saw David and his men coming, they went out to greet them.
And David greeted them and said to them, “I hope that things are going well with
you!”
1 SAMUEL 30:22
436
1 SAMUEL 31:8
22 But
some of the men who had gone with David, men who were evil and
troublemakers, said, “These 200 men did not go with us. So we should not give
to them any of the things that we recovered/captured. Each of them should take only
his wife and children and go back to their homes.”
23 David replied, “No, my fellow Israelis, it would not be right to divide up like
that the things that Yahweh has allowed us to capture. Yahweh has protected us and
enabled us to defeat the enemies who attacked our town.
24 ◄Who will pay attention to you if you say things like that?/No one will pay
attention to you if you say things like that.► [RHQ] The men who stayed here with
our supplies will get the same amount that the men who went into the battle will get.
They will all receive the same amount.”
25 David made that to be a law [DOU] for the Israeli people, and that is still a law
in Israel.
26 When David and all the others arrived in Ziklag, David sent to his friends who
were leaders in Judah some of the things that they had captured from the Amalek
people-group. He said to them, “Here is a present for you. These are things that we
took from Yahweh’s enemies.”
27 Here is a list of the cities and towns to whose leaders David sent gifts: Bethel,
Ramoth in the southern part of Judah, Jattir,
28 Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa,
29 Racal, the cities where the descendants of Jehrameel lived and the cities where
the Ken people-group lived,
30 Hormah, Bor-Ashan, Athach,
31 Hebron, and all the other places where David and his men had gone when they
were hiding from Saul.
31
Saul and his sons died in a battle
1 Later, the Philistines again fought against the Israelis. The Israelis ran away from
Mountain.
his sons, Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua.
3 The fighting was very fierce around Saul. When the Philistine ◄archers/men with
bows and arrows► caught up with Saul, they wounded him badly with their arrows.
4 Saul said to the man who was carrying his weapons, “Take out your sword and
kill me with it, in order that these heathen Philistines will not be able to thrust their
swords into me and make fun of me while I am dying.”
But the man who was carrying Saul’s weapons was terrified, and refused to do that.
So Saul took his own sword and fell on it. The sword pierced his body and he died.
5 When the man carrying his weapons saw that Saul was dead, he also threw himself
on his own sword and died.
6 So Saul, three of his sons, and the man who carried Saul’s weapons, all died on
that same day.
7 When the Israeli people on the north side of the Jezreel Valley and on the east
side of the Jordan River heard that the Israeli army had run away and that Saul and
his sons had died, they left their towns and ran away. Then the Philistines came and
occupied their towns.
8 The next day, when the Philistines came to take away the weapons of the dead
Israeli soldiers, they found the bodies of Saul and his three sons on Gilboa Mountain.
1 SAMUEL 31:9
437
9 They cut off Saul’s head and took his weapons.
1 SAMUEL 31:13
Then they sent messengers
throughout their land, to proclaim the news, in the temple where they kept their
idols, and to the other people, that their army had killed Saul.
10 They put Saul’s weapons in the temple of their goddess Astarte. They also fastened
the bodies of Saul and his sons to the wall that surrounded Beth-Shan city.
11 When the people who lived in Jabesh in the Gilead region heard what the
Philistines had done to Saul’s corpse,
12 all their bravest soldiers walked all night to Beth-Shan. They took the corpses of
Saul and his sons down from the city wall, and they took them back to Jabesh and
burned the corpses there.
13 They took the bones and buried them under a big tamarisk tree. Then they
◄fasted/abstained from eating food► for seven days.
2 SAMUEL 1:1

2 SAMUEL 1:17
This book contains the account of King David reigning
over all of Israel. We call this book
2 Samuel
David found out about Saul’s death
1 After Saul died, David and the men who were with him returned to Ziklag town
after defeating the descendants of Amalek. They stayed in Ziklag for two days.
Saul’s army was camped. He had torn his clothes and put dust on his head to show
that he was grieving. He came to David, and prostrated himself on the ground in front
of David to show respect for him.
3 David asked him, “Where have you come from?” The man replied, “I escaped
from where the Israeli army had been camped.”
4 David asked him, “What happened? Tell me about the battle!” The man replied,
“The Israeli soldiers ran away from the battle. Many of them were killed. And Saul
and his son Jonathan ◄are dead/were also killed►.”
5 David said to the young man, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan
are dead?”
6 The young man replied, “It happened that I was on Gilboa Mountain where the
battle occurred, and I saw Saul, leaning on his spear. The enemy chariots and their
drivers had come very close to Saul.
7 Saul turned around and saw me, and he called out to me. I answered him and
said, ‘What do you want me to do?’
8 He replied, ‘Who are you?’ I replied, ‘I am a descendant of Amalek.’
9 Then he said to me, ‘Come over here and kill me. I am still alive, but I am enduring
a lot of pain.’
10 So I went to him and killed him, because I knew that he was wounded very badly
and would ◄not continue to live/soon die►. I took the crown that was on his head
and the band/bracelet that was on his arm, and I have brought them to you.”
11 Then David and all the men who were with him tore their clothes to show that
they were very sad.
12 They mourned for Saul and his son Jonathan, and they cried and ◄fasted/
abstained from eating food► until it was evening. They also mourned for all the
army of Yahweh, and for all the Israeli people, because many of their soldiers had
been killed in the battle [MTY].
13 Then David asked the young man who had told him about the battle, “Where are
you from?” He replied, “My father is a descendant of Amalek, but we live in Israel.”
14 David asked him, “◄Why were you not afraid that you would be punished if you
killed Saul, whom Yahweh had appointed [MTY] to be the king?/You should have been
afraid that you would be punished if you killed Saul, whom Yahweh had appointed
[MTY] to be the king.► [RHQ]
15-16 You yourself said, ‘I killed the man whom Yahweh appointed to be the king.’
So you have caused yourself to be guilty [MTY] of causing your own death!” Then
David summoned one of his soldiers and said to him, “Kill him!” So the soldier killed
him by striking him with a sword.
David’s song about Saul and Jonathan
17 Then David composed/wrote this sad song about Saul and Jonathan,
2 SAMUEL 1:18
439
2 SAMUEL 2:3
18 and he commanded that it be taught to the people of Judah.
The song is called
‘The Bow and Arrow’ and it has been written in the Book of Jashar:
19 “You Israeli people, your glorious [MTY] leaders have been killed on the mountains!
It is very sad that those mighty men have died!

David was appointed to be the king of Judah
1 Some time after that, David asked Yahweh, “Should I go back to live in one of the
towns in Judah?” Yahweh replied, “Yes, go up there.” Then David asked, “To which
town should I go?” Yahweh replied, “To Hebron.”
2 So David went up there, taking his two wives, Ahinoam who was from Jezreel city,
and Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel city.
3 He also took the men who had been with him, and their families. They all started
to live in villages near Hebron.
2 SAMUEL 2:4
440
2 SAMUEL 2:22
4 Then the men of Judah came to Hebron, and one of them poured olive oil on
David’s head to show they were appointing him to be [MTY] the king of the tribe
[MTY] of Judah.
When David found out that the people of Jabesh town in the Gilead region had
buried Saul’s body,
5 he sent messengers to the men of Jabesh to tell them this: “I desire/hope that
Yahweh will bless you for having shown, by burying the body of Saul your king, that
you were loyal to him.
6 Now I also desire/hope that Yahweh will faithfully love you and be loyal to you.
And I will do good things for you because of what you have done for Saul.
of Judah, who have appointed me to be their king.”
Ishbosheth was appointed to be the king of Israel
8 While this was happening, Ner’s son Abner, the commander of Saul’s army, took
Saul’s son Ishbosheth and went across the Jordan River to Mahanaim town.
9 There Abner proclaimed that Ishbosheth was now the king of the Gilead region
and of the tribe of Asher and the region of Jezreel and the tribes of Ephraim and
Benjamin. That meant that he was the king of all of the people of Israel.
10 Ishbosheth was 40 years old when he started to rule over the people of Israel. He
ruled them for two years. But the tribe of Judah ◄was loyal to David/wanted David
to be their king►,
11 and he ruled them for seven and a half years while he was living in Hebron.
The war between the armies of Judah and Israel
12 One day Abner and the officials of Isbosheth went from Mahanaim across the
Jordan River to Gibeon city.
13 Joab, whose mother was Zeruiah, and some of David’s officials went from Hebron
to Gibeon, and met at the pool there. They all sat down, the one group on one side of
the pool and the other group on the other side.
replied, “Okay!”
of David’s soldiers.
thrust his sword into that man’s side. The result was that all 24 of them fell down
dead. So that area in Gibeon is now called ‘Field of Swords’.
17 Then the others started to fight. It was a very fierce battle. Abner and the men
of Israel were defeated by David’s soldiers.
Joab’s brother Asahel was killed
18 Zeruiah’s three sons were there on that day: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel.
Asahel
was able to run very fast; he could run as fast as a wild gazelle/antelope.
19 Asahel started to pursue Abner. He ran straight toward Abner, without stopping.
20 Abner looked behind him, and said “Is that you, Asahel?” Asahel replied, “Yes!”
21 Abner yelled at him, “Turn to one side or the other, and pursue someone else!”
But Asahel would not stop pursuing Abner.
22 So Abner yelled at him again, “Stop ◄chasing after/pursuing► me! ◄Why should
I kill you?/It would not be good for me to kill you!► [RHQ] If I did that, ◄how could
I <face/be reconciled with> your brother Joab?/it would be very difficult for me to
<face/be reconciled with> your brother Joab.► [RHQ]”
2 SAMUEL 2:23
441
2 SAMUEL 3:6
23 But Asahel refused to stop pursuing Abner. So Abner suddenly turned and thrust
the butt end of his spear into Asahel’s stomach. Because he thrust it very strongly,
that end of the spear went though Asahel’s body and came out at his back, and he fell
to the ground, dead. All the other soldiers who came to the place where his body was
lying stopped and stood there, stunned.
24 But Joab and Abishai continued to pursue Abner. At sunset they came to Ammah
Hill, which is east of Giah, along the road to the desert near Gibeon.
25 The men from the tribe of Benjamin gathered around Abner in one group, and
stood at the top of a hill.
26 Then Abner called out to Joab, saying “Are we going to continue to fight forever
[RHQ]? Do you not realize that if we continue fighting, the result will be very bad
[RHQ]? We are all descendants of Jacob. So we should stop fighting each other ◄How
long will it be until you tell your soldiers to stop pursuing us?/Tell your soldiers to
stop pursuing us.►” [RHQ]
27 Joab replied, “Just as surely as God lives, if you had not said that, my soldiers
would have continued pursuing your men until tomorrow morning!”
28 So Joab blew a trumpet to signal that they should stop fighting. So all his men did
that. They did not pursue the soldiers of Israel any more, and they stopped fighting.
29 That night Abner and his soldiers went through the Jordan River Valley. They
crossed the Jordan River and marched all the next morning, and they finally arrived
at Mahanaim.

father had been buried, in Bethlehem. Then they marched all during the night, and
3
1 There was a long war between those who wanted Saul’s son to be their king and
those who wanted David to be their king. But more and more people began to want
David to be the king, while the number of people who wanted Saul’s son to be the
king continued to become smaller.
David’s sons born at Hebron
2 David’s wives gave birth to six sons at Hebron.
The oldest was Amnon, whose
mother was Ahinoam, from Jezreel city.
3 The next one was Kileab, whose mother was Abigail, the widow of Nabal, from
Carmel city.
The next one was Absalom, whose mother was Maacah, the daughter of Talmai,
the king of the Geshur region.
4 The next one was Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith.
The next one was Shephatiah, whose mother was Abital.
5 The youngest one was Ithream, whose mother was Eglah, another one of David’s
wives.
Those sons of David were all born in Hebron.
Abner decided that David would be king of all of them
6 While those who wanted Saul’s son to rule over them and those who wanted
David to rule over them continued to fight against each other, Abner was becoming
more influential among those who wanted Saul’s son to be the king.
2 SAMUEL 3:7
442
2 SAMUEL 3:22
7 When Saul was alive, he had as one of his wives a slave woman named Rizpah, the
daughter of Aiah. But one day Abner had sexual relations with her. So Ishbosheth said
to Abner, “Why have you had sexual relations with [EUP] my father’s slave wife?”
8 Abner became very angry about what Ishbosheth said to him.
He said to
Ishbosheth, “◄Do you think that I am a worthless dog [MET] from Judah?/You are
treating me as though I am a worthless dog [MET] from Judah.► [RHQ] From the
beginning, I have been loyal to Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends.
And I have prevented you from being defeated by David’s army. So now ◄why are
you criticizing me about what I have done with some woman?/you should not be
criticizing me about what I have done with some woman.► [RHQ]
9-10 Yahweh solemnly promised that he would not allow Saul and his descendants
to continue to rule. He promised that he would cause David to rule over all the tribes
of Israel and Judah, from Dan city far in the north to Beersheba city far in the south.
So I hope/desire that God will punish me severely [HYP] if I do not enable that to
happen!”
11 Ishbosheth was very afraid of Abner, so he did not say anything in reply to Abner.
12 Then Abner sent messengers to David when he was at Hebron, to say to him,
“Either you or I should be [RHQ] the ruler of this entire nation, but not Isbosheth.
However, if you make an agreement with me, I will help you by encouraging all the
people of Israel to ◄be want you to be their king/start to support► you.”
13 David sent back this reply: “Good! I am willing to make an agreement with you.
But before that happens, there is one thing that you must do. When you come to see
me, you must bring my wife Michal, Saul’s daughter.”
14 Then David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, to say to him, “I had to kill 100 men
from Philistia and cut off their foreskins to give to Saul to pay for Michal to be my
wife. So now give her back to me!”
15 So Ishbosheth sent some men to take Michal from her husband Palti. But when
they took her, her husband followed them all the way to Bahurim town, crying as he
went.
16 Then Abner turned and said to him, “Go back home!”, so he did.
17 Abner went to the Israeli leaders and talked with them. He said, “For a long time
you have wanted David to be your king.
18 So now you have an opportunity to do that. Keep in mind that Yahweh promised
this: ‘With the help of David, who serves me well, I will rescue my people from the
people of Philistia, and from the power [MTY] of all their other enemies’.”
19 Abner also spoke to the people of the tribe of Benjamin. Then he went to Hebron,
to tell David what all the people of Israel and the people of the tribe of Benjamin had
agreed to do.
20 When Abner came with 20 of his soldiers to see David at Hebron, David made a
feast for all of them.
all the people of Israel to accept you to be their king, as you have desired.” Then
Joab murdered Abner
captured. But Abner was not there at Hebron, because David had sent him safely
home.
2 SAMUEL 3:23
443
2 SAMUEL 3:39
23 When Joab and the soldiers who were with him arrived, someone told him that
Abner had come there and talked with the king, and that the king allowed to go home
safely.
24 So Joab went to the king and said, “Why have you done that? Listen to me! Abner
is your enemy, but when he came to you, you allowed him [RHQ] to leave!
25 Do you not know that he came to you to deceive you and to find out everything
that you are doing, and all the places that you go to?”
26 After Joab left David, he sent some messengers to get Abner. They found him at
Sirah Well, and brought him back to Hebron, but David did not know that they had
done that.
27 So when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab met him at the city gate, and took him
aside as though he wanted to speak with him privately. Then he stabbed Abner in
the stomach with his knife/sword. In that way he murdered Abner because Abner had
killed [MTY] Joab’s brother Asahel.
28 Later, after David heard what had happened, he said, “Yahweh knows that I and
the people of my kingdom are not at all ◄responsible for/guilty of► murdering [MTY]
Abner.
29 I hope/desire that Joab and all his family will be punished [MTY] for doing that!
I hope/desire that there will always be someone in his family who has sores, or
someone who is a leper, or some man who is forced to do women’s work, or someone
who is killed in a battle, or someone who does not have enough food to eat!”
30 That is how Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner, because he had killed
their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.
31 Then David said to Joab and to all Joab’s soldiers, “Tear your clothes and put on
coarse cloth to show that you are sad, and mourn for Abner!” And at the funeral, King
David walked behind the men who were carrying the coffin.
32 They buried Abner’s body at Hebron. And at the grave, the king cried loudly, and
all the other people also cried.
33 David sang this sad song to lament for Abner:
“It is not right that [RHQ] Abner died like outlaws die!
34 No one tied his hands or put chains on his feet, like they do to criminals.
No, he was murdered by wicked men!”
35 Then many [HYP] people came to David to tell him to eat some food before sunset,
but David refused. He said, “I hope/desire that God will punish me severely [HYP] if
I eat any food before the sun goes down!”
36 All the people saw what David did, and they were pleased. Truly, everything that
the king did pleased the people.
38 The king said to his officials, “◄Do you not realize that a leader and a great man
today in Israel.► [RHQ]
39 Even though Yahweh appointed me to be the king, today I feel weak. These two
sons of Zeruiah, Joab and Abishai, are very violent; I cannot control them. So I hope/
desire that Yahweh will punish them severely in return for this wicked thing that
they have done!”
4
Ishbosheth was murdered
2 SAMUEL 4:1
444
2 SAMUEL 5:4
1 When Saul’s son Ishbosheth heard that Abner had been killed at Hebron,
he
realized that he might also be killed. He became discouraged, and all the Israeli people
◄trembled/became afraid►.
2 Ishbosheth had two officers who were leaders of groups that raided other villages.
They were brothers; their names were Baanah and Rechab, sons of Rimmon from
Beeroth town in the tribe of Benjamin. Beeroth is in the area that had been assigned
to the tribe of Benjamin.
3 But the people of Beeroth had fled to Gittaim town, and they still live there.
4 Saul’s son Jonathan had a son named Mephibosheth. When Mephibosheth was
five years old, Saul and Jonathan died in the battle. When people brought that news
from Jezreel, Mephibosheth’s nursemaid picked him up and ran away. She ran very
fast, with the result that she dropped him, and his legs became crippled.
5 One day, Rechab and Baanah left their home to go to Ishbosheth’s house. They
arrived there about noontime, when Ishbosheth was taking his midday nap.
6 The woman who was the doorkeeper was sifting wheat. While doing that, she
became sleepy, and fell asleep. So Rechab and his brother Baanah were able to creep
in quietly.
7 They entered Ishbosheth’s bedroom, where he was sleeping. They killed him with
their swords and cut off his head. They carried his head and walked all night through
the Jordan River Valley.
8 They took the head of Ishbosheth to David at Hebron. They said to him, “Here
is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of your enemy Saul, who tried to kill you. Your
majesty, today Yahweh has allowed you to get revenge on Saul and his descendants!”
9 But David replied to them, “Yahweh is the one who has rescued me from all my
troubles. And just as surely as Yahweh lives, what I am now saying is also true.
10 When a messenger came to Ziklag and told me ‘Saul is dead!’ and he thought that
the news that he was bringing to me was good news, I seized him and commanded
one of my soldiers to kill him. That was the reward I gave to him for his news!
11 So because you two evil men murdered a man who is ◄innocent/has done nothing
wrong► when he was sleeping on his bed in his own house, I will do something worse
to you. I will surely [RHQ] get revenge on you two for murdering [MTY] him, and
◄wipe you/cause you to disappear► from the earth!”
hands and their feet, and hung their bodies (OR, their hands and feet) on a pole near
in the tomb of Abner, there at Hebron.
5
1 Then the leaders of all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and said to
him, “Listen, we have the same ancestors [IDM] that you do.
2 In the past, when Saul was our king, it was you who led our Israeli soldiers in our
battles. You are the one to whom Yahweh promised, ‘You will be the leader [MET] of
my people; you will be their king.’ ”
3 So while Yahweh was listening, all those leaders of the people of Israel declared
there at Hebron that David would be their king. And David made a sacred agreement
with them. They anointed him with olive oil to set him apart to be the king of the
Israeli people.
4 David was 30 years old when he became their king. He ruled them for 40 years.
2 SAMUEL 5:5
445
2 SAMUEL 5:21
Jerusalem he ruled over all the people of Judah and Israel for 33 years.
people-group who lived there. The people there thought that David’s army would not
be able to capture the city, so they sent a message to David, saying “Your army will
never be able to get inside our city! Even the blind and crippled people will be able
to chase you away!”
7 But David’s army captured the fortress on Zion Hill, and later it was known as
David’s City.
8 On that day, David said to his soldiers, “Those who want to get rid of the Jebus
people-group should go through the water tunnel to enter the city. Then they can
attack those people whom I [SYN] detest—and we will find out if any blind and crippled
people will be able to stop them!” That is why people say, “Blind and crippled people
cannot enter Yahweh’s temple.”
9 After David and his soldiers captured the city with its strong walls around it, he
lived there, and they named it ‘David’s City’. David and his soldiers built the city
around the fortress, starting where the land was ◄filled in/terraces► on the east side
of the hill.
10 David continued to become more and more powerful/influential, because the
Almighty Commander of the armies of angels was with/helping him.
11 One day Hiram, the king of Tyre city, sent ambassadors/messengers to David to
talk about making agreements between their countries. Hiram agreed to provide cedar
trees to make lumber, and also that he would send carpenters and masons, to build a
palace for David.
be the king of Israel, and that Yahweh was going to cause his kingdom to prosper,
13 After David moved from Hebron to Jerusalem, he took more slave women to be
birth to more sons and daughters.
14 The names of the sons who were born in Jerusalem were Shammua, Shobab,
Nathan, Solomon,
15 Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
16 Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
David’s army defeated the Philistines
17 When the Philistia people heard that David had been appointed to be the king of
Israel, their army went up toward Jerusalem to try to capture David. But David heard
that they were coming, so he went down to another fortified place.
18 The army of Philistia arrived at Rephaim Valley southwest of Jerusalem and spread
all over the valley.
19 David asked Yahweh, “Should my men and I attack the Philistia army? Will you
enable us to defeat them [IDM]?” Yahweh replied, “Yes, attack them, because I will
certainly enable your army to defeat them. [IDM]”
20 So David and his army went to where the Philistia army was, and there they
defeated them. Then David said, “Yahweh has burst through my enemies like a flood.”
[SIM] So that place is called ‘Lord of Bursting-through’.
21 The Philistia men left their idols there; so David and his soldiers took them away.
2 SAMUEL 5:22
446
2 SAMUEL 6:14
22 Then the Philistia army returned to Rephaim Valley and spread all over the valley.
23 So again David asked Yahweh if his army should attack them. But Yahweh replied,
“Do not attack them from here. Tell your men to go around them and attack them
from the other side, near the balsam trees.
24 When you hear something in the tops of the balsam trees that sounds like an
army marching, attack them, because I will have gone ahead of you to enable your
army to defeat their army.”
25 So David did what Yahweh told him to do, and his army defeated the Philistia
army from Geba city all the way west to Gezer city.
6
They moved the sacred chest to Jerusalem
1 Then David chose 30,000 Israeli men and gathered them together.
2 He led them to the place in Judah formerly called Baalah, now called Kiriath-Jearim.
They went in order to bring from there to Jerusalem the sacred chest, which had the
name of Yahweh, the leader of the armies of the angels in heaven, written on it, and
which had the statues of the winged creatures on top of it. Between those statues was
where Yahweh spoke messages about ruling his people [MTY].
3 The sacred chest was in the house of Abinadab, on top of a hill. They went there,
and they put the chest on a new cart. Uzzah and Ahio, the two sons of Abinadab,
were guiding the oxen that were pulling the cart.
5 David and all the Israeli men were celebrating in God’s presence, singing with all
castanets and cymbals.
So Uzzah put his hand on the sacred chest to ◄steady it/prevent it from falling off the
7 Yahweh immediately became very angry with Uzzah, and he killed him right
there alongside the sacred chest, because he had touched the chest, and Yahweh had
commanded that only the descendants of Levi who help the priests should touch the
sacred chest.
8 David was angry because Yahweh had punished Uzzah. So ever since that time,
that place has been called ‘The Punishment of Uzzah’.
9 David was also afraid of what else Yahweh would do to punish them, so he said,
“◄How can I take the sacred chest with me to Jerusalem?/I am afraid to take the
sacred chest with me to Jerusalem.►” [RHQ]
10 So he did not want to take the sacred chest to Jerusalem. Instead, they took it to
another place; they took it to the house of Obed-Edom, from Gath city.
11 They left the sacred chest in the house of Obed-Edom for three months, and
during that time Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom and his family.
12 Later, people told David, “Yahweh has blessed Obed-Edom and his family because
he is taking care of the sacred chest!” When David heard that, he and some other men
went to Obed-Edom’s house, and very joyfully brought the sacred chest from there
to Jerusalem.
13 This time, descendants of Levi were carrying the sacred chest, but when they had
walked only six steps, they stopped, and there David killed a bull and a fat calf, and
offered them to Yahweh for a sacrifice.
14 David was wearing only a linen cloth wrapped around his waist, and was dancing
very energetically to honor Yahweh.
2 SAMUEL 6:15
447
2 SAMUEL 7:9
15 David and the Israeli men took the sacred chest up to Jerusalem, shouting loudly
and blowing trumpets.
16 While they were carrying the sacred chest into the city, David’s wife Michal, who
was Saul’s daughter, looked out the window of her house. She saw King David leaping
and dancing to honor Yahweh. So she was disgusted with him.
17 They brought the sacred chest into the tent that David had erected for it. Then
David gave to Yahweh offerings to be completely burned on an altar, and other
offerings to maintain fellowship with Yahweh.
18 When David had finished offering those sacrifices, he asked Yahweh, the
Commander of the armies of the angels, to bless the people.
19 He also distributed food to all the people. To each Israeli man and woman he
gave a loaf of bread, some meat, and a raisin cake. Then all the people returned to
their homes.
20 When David went home to ask Yahweh to bless his family, his wife Michal came
out to meet him. She said to him, “Maybe you, the king of Israel, think that you [IRO]
were honoring yourself today, but really, you acted like a fool, uncovering yourself
while the female servants of your officials were watching!”
21 David replied to Michal, “I was doing that to honor Yahweh, who chose me instead
of your father and other members of his family, to be the king of the Israeli people,
the people who belong to Yahweh. And I will continue to dance to honor Yahweh!
22 Even though you think that what I did was disgraceful, I will continue to do it
even more. You may despise me because of what I did, but the women whom you
were talking about will honor me!”
23 As a result, Saul’s daughter Michal never gave birth to any children.

What God promised David
1 After King David began to live in his palace, Yahweh protected him from all his
enemies.
2 One day he said to the prophet Nathan, “It is not right that I am here, living
in a beautiful house made of cedar wood, but the chest that contains God’s Ten
Commandments is kept in a tent!”
3 Then Nathan said to the king, “Yahweh is helping/directing you, so do regarding
that chest whatever you are thinking.”
4 But that night, Yahweh said to Nathan,
5 “Go and tell my servant, David, that this is what I, Yahweh, am saying to him:
‘You are not the one [RHQ] who should build a temple for me to live in.
6 I have not lived in any building from the day that I brought the Israeli people
up from Egypt until now. Instead, I have been living in a tent, moving from one place
to another when the Israelis moved to other places.
7 Wherever I went with all the Israelis as they traveled, I never said [RHQ] to any
of their leaders whom I appointed to lead them, “Why have you not built me a temple
made of cedar wood?” ’
of the armies of angels says that he took you from a pasture where you were taking

2 SAMUEL 7:10-11
448
2 SAMUEL 7:27
10-11 Formerly, during the time that I appointed leaders for my Israeli people,
many violent groups oppressed the Israelis. But this will not happen any more. I
have chosen a place where my Israeli people can live peacefully and no one will
disturb them any more. I will give them rest from being attacked by their enemies.
And I will defeat all your enemies.
I declare to you that I, Yahweh, will enable your descendants to rule after you
die.
12 When your life ends [EUP] and you go to be with your ancestors, I will appoint
one of your sons to be king, and I will enable his kingdom to ◄be strong/resist all
their enemies►.
13 He is the one who will arrange for a temple to be built for me [MTY], and I will
cause his descendants to be kings [MTY] of Israel forever.
14 I will be like a father to him, and it will be as though he is a son to me [MET].
When he does something that is wrong, I will punish him as fathers punish their sons.
15 But I will not stop faithfully loving him as I stopped loving Saul, whom I
removed from being king before you became king.
16 Your descendants will rule the kingdom of Israel forever. Their rule will never
end. [DOU]’ ”
17 So Nathan told David everything that Yahweh had told him.
David gave thanks to God
18 Then David went into the Sacred Tent and sat in the presence of Yahweh, and
prayed this:
“Yahweh, my God, I am not worthy [RHQ] for you to have done all these things
for me, and my family is not worthy, either.
19 “And now, O Yahweh my God, in addition to everything else, you have spoken
about what will happen to my descendants in the future for many generations.
20 “ Yahweh God, what more can I, David, say to you for honoring me? Although
you know very well what I am like, Yahweh my God, you have done things for me
as though I was the most important man on the earth!
21 For my sake and because it is what you wanted to do, you have done all these
great things for me.
22 “ Yahweh my God, you are great. There is no one like you. Only you are God,
just as we have always heard.
23 And there is no other nation in the world like Israel. Israel is the only nation
on the earth whose people you went out to rescue [RHQ]. By the great and awesome
things that you did, you have become famous/well-known throughout the world. As
your people advanced through this land, you expelled other people-groups who were
here in Canaan, who worshiped other gods.
24 And you caused us Israeli people to be your people forever, and you, Yahweh,
have become our God!
25 “And now, Yahweh my God, I pray that you will cause the things that you
the things that you said that you would do.
‘The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels is the God who rules Israel.’ And
27 “Yahweh Almighty, the God whom we Israeli people worship, you have revealed
to me that you will make some of my descendants kings. For that reason, I have
been brave enough to pray like this to you.
2 SAMUEL 7:28
449
2 SAMUEL 8:15
28 So now, O Yahweh Almighty, because you are God, we can trust that you will
do what you promise. You have promised these good things to me.
29 So now I ask you that if it pleases you, you will bless my descendants, in order
and so I know that you will keep blessing my descendants forever.”

David’s army won many victories
1 Some time later, David’s army attacked the Philistia army and defeated them. They
took control over the entire Philistia area.
2 David’s army also defeated the army of the Moab people-group. David forced their
soldiers to lie down on the ground close to each other. His men killed two out of every
three of them. The other Moab people were forced to accept David as their ruler, and
they were forced to give to him every year the payment/tax that he demanded.
3 David’s army also defeated the army of Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, who ruled
the state of Zobah in Syria. That happened when David went to rule again over the
area at the upper part of the Euphrates River.
4 David’s army captured 1,700 of Hadadezer’s soldiers who rode on horses, and
20,000 of his other soldiers. They also crippled/hamstrung most of the horses that
pulled the chariots, but they left/spared enough horses to pull 100 chariots.
5 When the army of Syria came from Damascus city to help King Hadadezer’s army,
David’s soldiers killed 22,000 of them.
6 Then David stationed ◄groups of his soldiers/army camps► in their area, and
the people of Syria were forced to accept David as their ruler, and to give to David’s
government every year the payment/tax that he demanded. And Yahweh enabled
David’s army to win victories wherever they went.
7 David’s soldiers took the gold shields that were carried by Hadadezer’s officials,
and brought them to Jerusalem.
8 They also brought to Jerusalem a lot of bronze that they found in Betah and
Berothai, two cities that King Hadadezer had previously ruled.
9 When Toi, the king of the Hamath city in Syria, heard that David’s army had
defeated the entire army of King Hadadezer,
10 he sent his son Joram to greet King David and to ◄congratulate him/say that
he was happy► about his army defeating Hadadezer’s army, which Toi’s army had
fought many times. Joram brought to David many items/gifts made from gold, silver,
and bronze.
11 King David dedicated all those items to Yahweh. He also dedicated the silver and
gold which his army had taken from the nations that they had conquered.
12 They had taken items from the Edom people-group and the Moab people-group,
from the Ammon people-group, from the Philistia people, and from the descendants
of Amalek, as well as from the people that Hadadezer previously ruled.
13 When David returned after defeating the armies of Syria, he became more famous
because his army killed 18,000 soldiers from the Edom people-group in the Salt Valley
14 David stationed ◄groups of his soldiers/army camps► throughout the Edom area,
to win battles wherever they went.

2 SAMUEL 10:1
16 Joab was the army commander; Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the man
who reported to the people everything that David decided that they should do;
17 Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were the priests;
Seraiah was the official secretary;
18 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was the commander of ◄David’s bodyguards/the
men who protected the king►; and David’s sons were priests (OR, his administrators/
advisors).
David was kind to Mephibosheth
1 One day David asked, “Is there anyone who is a descendant of Saul to whom I can
be kind?” He asked this because he wanted to honor Jonathan.
2 They told him that there was in Jerusalem a man named Ziba who had been a
servant of Saul’s family. So David sent messengers to summon Ziba. When he arrived,
the king asked him, “Are you Ziba?” He replied, “Yes, your majesty, I am.”
3 The king asked him, “Is there anyone in Saul’s family to whom I can be kind, as I
promised Jonathan that I would do?” Ziba replied, “Yes, there is one son of Jonathan
who is still alive. His feet are crippled.”
4 The king asked him, “Where is he?” Ziba replied, “He is living in the house of
Machir, son of Ammiel, in Lo-Debar city east of the Jordan River.”
5 So King David sent messengers to bring Mephibosheth to Jerusalem.
6 When Mephibosheth came to David, he knelt down with his face on the ground,
to show respect. Then David said, “Mephibosheth!” He replied, “Yes, your majesty,
how may I serve you?”
7 David said to him, “Do not be afraid; I will be kind to you because Jonathan your
father was my loyal friend. I will give back to you all the land that belonged to your
grandfather Saul. And I want you to always eat with me at my house [MTY].”
8 Mephibosheth bowed in front of David again and said, “Sir, I am as worthless as
[MET] a dead dog; I do not deserve [RHQ] that you be kind to me!”
9 Then the king summoned Saul’s servant Ziba and said to him, “Saul was your
master; now I am giving to Mephibosheth everything that belonged to Saul and his
family.
10 You and your 15 sons and your 20 servants must till/ plow the land for
Mephibosheth’s family, and plant crops and harvest them, in order that they will
have food to eat. But Mephibosheth will eat food with me at my house.”
11 Ziba replied to the king, “Your majesty, I will do everything that you have
commanded me to do.” So after that, Mephibosheth always ate at the king’s table, as
though he were one of the king’s sons.
12 Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica. All of Ziba’s family became servants
of Mephibosheth.
13 And Mephibosheth, who was still crippled in both of his feet, started to live in
Jerusalem, and he always ate ◄at the king’s table/with the king►.
10
David’s army defeated the Ammon people-group
1 Some time later, the king of the Ammon people-group died, and his son Hanun
became their king.
2 SAMUEL 10:2
451
2 SAMUEL 10:16
2 David thought, “Nahash was kind to me, so I will be kind to his son.”
So David
sent some officials there, to tell Hanun that David was sorry that Hanun’s father had
died.
When those messengers arrived in the land where the Ammon people-group lived,
3 the leaders of the Ammon people-group said to Hanun, “Do you think that it is
to honor your father that King David has sent these men to say that he is sorry that
your father died [RHQ]? We think that he has sent them here to look around the city
to determine how his army can conquer us!”
4 Hanun believed what they said; so he commanded some soldiers to seize David’s
officials and insult them by shaving off one side of each man’s beard, and by cutting
off the lower part of their robes, with the result that their buttocks could be seen, and
then they sent them away.
5 The men were very humiliated/ashamed, so they did not want to return home.
When David found out about what had happened to his officials, he sent someone
to tell them, “Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown again, and then return
home.”
6 Then the leaders of the Ammon people-group realized that they had greatly
insulted [IDM] David [IDM]. So they sent some men to hire/pay some soldiers from
other nearby areas to help defend them. They hired 20,000 soldiers from the BethRehob and Zobah regions northeast of Israel, and 12,000 soldiers from the Tob region,
7 When David heard about that, he sent Joab with all of the army that Joab
8 The soldiers of the Ammon people-group marched out and ◄stood in their
The other soldiers from Syria and Tob and Maacah stood by themselves ◄in their
positions/arranged themselves for battle► in the nearby fields.
9 Joab saw that there were groups of enemy soldiers in front of his troops and
behind his troops. So he chose some of the best Israeli soldiers, and put them in
positions to fight against the soldiers of Syria.
10 He appointed his older brother Abishai to be the commander of all the other
soldiers, and he told them to ◄stand in their positions/arrange themselves► in front
of the army of the Ammon people-group.
11 Then Joab said, “If the soldiers from Syria are too strong for us to defeat them,
your men must come and help us. But if the soldiers from the Ammon people-group
are too strong for you to defeat, we will come and help your men.
12 We must be strong, and fight hard [IDM] to defend our people and the cities ◄that
belong to/where we worship► our God. I will pray/request that Yahweh do what he
considers to be good.”
13 So Joab and his army advanced to attack the army of Syria, and the soldiers from
Syria ran away from them.
14 And when the soldiers of the Ammon people-group saw that the soldiers from
Syria were running away, they also started to run away from Abishai and his army,
and they retreated back inside the city. So Joab’s army stopped fighting against the
army of the Ammon people-group, and Joab and his army returned to Jerusalem.
15 After the leaders of the army of Syria saw that the Israeli army had defeated them,
they gathered all their troops together.
16 Their king, Hadadezer, summoned the soldiers of Syria who lived on the east side
of the Euphrates River. They gathered at Helam city. Their commander was Shobach.
2 SAMUEL 10:17
452
2 SAMUEL 11:13
17 When David heard about that,
he gathered all the Israeli soldiers, and they
crossed the Jordan River and marched to Helam. There, the army of Syria ◄took
their positions/arranged themselves for battle►, and the battle started.
18 But the soldiers of Syria ran away from the Israeli soldiers. David and his army
killed 700 of their chariot-drivers and 40,000 other soldiers. They also wounded
Shobach, their commander, and he died there.
19 When all the kings who had been ruled by Hadadezer realized that they had been
defeated by the Israeli army, they made peace with the Israelis and agreed to accept
David as their king. So the army of Syria was afraid to help the army of the Ammon
people-group any more.
11
David sinned with Bathsheba
1 In that region, kings usually went with their armies to fight their enemies in the
springtime. But the following year, in the springtime, David did not do that. Instead,
went with the other officers and the rest of the Israeli army. They crossed the Jordan
capital city, Rabbah.
the flat roof of his palace. He saw a woman who was bathing in the courtyard of her
house. The woman was very beautiful.
3 David sent a messenger to find out who she was. The messenger returned and said,
“She is [RHQ] Bathsheba. She is the daughter of Eliam, and her husband is Uriah,
from the Heth people-group.”
4 Then David sent more messengers to get her. They brought her to David, and he
◄slept/had sex► [EUP] with her. (She had just finished performing the rituals to make
herself pure after her monthly menstrual period.) Then Bathsheba went back home.
5 After some time, she realized that she was pregnant. So she sent a messenger to
tell David that she was pregnant.
6 Then David sent a message to Joab. He said, “Send Uriah, from the Heth peoplegroup, to me.” So Joab did that. He sent Uriah to David.
7 When he arrived, David asked if Joab was well, and if other soldiers were well,
and how the war was progressing.
8 Then David, hoping that Uriah would go home and sleep with his wife, said to Uriah,
“Okay, go home and relax for a while. [IDM]” So Uriah left, and David gave someone
a gift of some food to take to Uriah’s house.
palace guards.
10 When someone told David that Uriah did not go to his house that night, David
summoned him again and said to him, “Why didn’t you go home to be with your wife
last night, after having been away for a long time?” [RHQ]
11 Uriah replied, “The soldiers of Judah and Israel are camping in the open fields,
and even our commander Joab is sleeping in a tent, and the sacred chest is with them.
◄How could I/It would not be right for me to► go home, eat and drink, and sleep with
my wife [RHQ]. I solemnly declare [IDM] that I will never do such a thing!”
12 Then David said to Uriah, “Stay here today. I will let you return to the battle
tomorrow.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and that night.
13 The next day, David invited him to a meal. So Uriah had a meal with David, and
David made him drink a lot of wine so that he would get drunk, hoping that if he
2 SAMUEL 11:14
453
2 SAMUEL 12:3
was drunk, he would sleep with his wife. But that night, Uriah again did not go home.
Instead, he slept on his cot with the king’s servants.
14 Someone reported that to David, so the next morning he wrote a letter to Joab,
and gave it to Uriah to take to Joab.
15 In the letter, he wrote, “Put Uriah in the front line, where the fighting is the
◄worst/most severe►. Then command the soldiers to pull back from him, in order
that he will be killed by our enemies.”
16 So after Joab got the letter, as his army was surrounding the city, he sent Uriah
to a place where he knew that their enemies’ strongest and best soldiers would be
fighting.
17 The men from the city came out and fought with Joab’s soldiers. They killed
some of David’s officers, including Uriah.
18 Then Joab sent a messenger to David to tell him about the fighting.
19 He said to the messenger, “Tell David the news about the battle. After you finish
telling that to him,
20 if David is angry because so many officers were killed, he may ask you, ‘Why did
your soldiers go so close to the city to fight [RHQ]? Did you not know that they would
21 Do you not remember how Abimelech, the son of Gideon, was killed? A woman

the city to fight us in the fields. They were defeating us but we forced them back to
the city gate.
24 Then their archers shot arrows at us from the top of the city wall. They killed
some of your officers. They killed your officer Uriah, too.”
25 David said to the messenger, “Go back to Joab and say to him, ‘Do not be distressed
about what happened, because no one ever knows who will be killed in a battle.’ Tell
him that the next time his troops should attack the city more strongly, and capture
it.”
26 When Uriah’s wife Bathsheba heard that her husband had died, she mourned for
him.
27 When her time of mourning was ended, David sent messengers to bring her to
the palace. Thus, she became David’s wife. She later gave birth to a son. But Yahweh
was very displeased with what David had done.
12
Nathan rebuked David
1 Yahweh told the prophet Nathan what David had done, and he sent Nathan to tell
this story to David: “I heard about two men who were living in a certain city. One
was rich and the other was poor.
2 The rich man owned a lot of cattle and sheep.
3 But the poor man had only one little female lamb, which he had bought. He raised
the lamb, and it grew up with his children. He would give the lamb some of his own
food and let it drink from his cup. He let the lamb sleep in his arms. The lamb was
like a daughter to him.
2 SAMUEL 12:4
454
2 SAMUEL 12:21
4 One day a visitor came to visit the rich man.
The rich man did not want to take
one of his own animals and kill it to prepare a meal for the visitor. So instead, he
stole the poor man’s lamb and killed it and prepared a meal for his visitor.”
5 When David heard that, he was very angry about what the rich man had done. He
said to Nathan, “I solemnly declare that the man who did that should be executed!
6 But before he is executed, he should pay back to the poor man four lambs for
doing this, and for not having pity on the poor man.”
7 Nathan said to David, “You are the man I have been talking about! And this is
what Yahweh, the God we Israelis worship, says to you: ‘I appointed you to be king
of Israel, after having rescued you from Saul.
8 I gave you his palace and his wives. I caused you to become the king to rule Israel
and Judah. If you had told me that you were not content with what I gave you, I
would have given you twice as much!
have done what I consider to be very evil! You have arranged for Uriah to be killed
your wife!
10 You have despised me, and have taken Uriah’s wife to be your wife. So for many
generations some of your descendants will die violently. [MTY, PRS]
11 I solemnly declare to you that I will cause someone from your own family to
bring trouble to you. I will take your wives and give them to him, and he will have
sexual relations with them in the daytime, where everyone can see it, and you will
know all about it.
12 What you did, you did secretly, but what I will cause to happen, everyone in
Israel will be able to see it or know about it. [IDM]’ ”
13 David replied, “I have sinned against Yahweh.” Nathan said to David, “Yahweh
has forgiven you for your sin: You will not die because of this sin.
14 But, you have shown contempt for Yahweh by doing this. So, your baby will die.”
15 Then Nathan went home.
David’s baby died
Then Yahweh caused the baby t o become very sick, the one that Uriah’s wife had
given birth to.
16 So David prayed to God that the child would not die. He ◄fasted/abstained from
food►, and he went into the room where he slept and lay all night on the floor.
17 The next morning his advisors stood around him and urged him to get up. But he
would not get up, and he would not eat any food with them.
18 One week later the baby died. David’s servants were afraid to tell that to David.
They said to each other, “Hey, while the baby was still alive, we talked to him, but
he would not answer us. Now, if we tell him that the baby is dead [RHQ], he may do
something to harm himself!”
19 But when David saw that his servants were whispering something to each other,
he realized that the baby must be dead. So he asked them, “Is the baby dead?” They
replied, “Yes, he is dead.”
20 Then David got up from the floor. He bathed himself, put lotions on his body,
and put on other clothes, Then he went into Yahweh’s Sacred Tent and worshiped
Yahweh. Then he went home. He asked his servants for some food. They gave him
some, and he ate it.
21 Then his servants said to him, “We do not understand [RHQ] why you have done
this! While the baby was still alive, you cried for him and refused to eat anything.
2 SAMUEL 12:22
455
2 SAMUEL 13:6
But now that the baby has died, you are not crying any more! You got up and ate some
food!”
22 David replied, “While the baby was still alive, I fasted and cried. I thought, ‘Who
knows? Yahweh may be merciful to me and not allow the baby to die’.
23 But now the baby is dead. So ◄there is no reason for me to <fast/abstain from
eating food> any more./why should I <fast/abstain from eating food> any more?►
[RHQ] ◄Can I bring him back to me?/I certainly cannot bring him back to me!► [RHQ]
Some day I will go to where he is, but he will not return to me.”
24 Then David comforted his wife, Bathsheba. Then he ◄slept/had sexual relations►
with her, and she became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. David named
that son Solomon. Yahweh loved that little boy.
means ‘loved by Yahweh’, because Yahweh loved him.
27 Then Joab sent messengers to David, to tell him this: “My troops are attacking
Rabbah, and we have captured the city’s water supply.
28 Now gather your troops and come and surround the city and capture it. If you
do not do that, my troops will capture the city and it will then be named ‘the City of
Joab’.”
29 So David gathered all his troops. They went with David to Rabbah and attacked
it and captured it.
30 Then David took the crown from the head of the king of Rabbah (OR, from the
head of Milcom the god of Rabbah) and put it on his own head. It was very heavy;
it weighed ◄75 pounds/34 kg.►, and it had many very valuable stones fastened to it.
His soldiers also took many other valuable things from the city.
31 Then they brought the people of Rabbah out of the city and forced them to work
for them using saws and iron picks and axes. David’s troops also forced them to make
bricks. David’s soldiers did this in all the towns of the Ammon people-group. Then
David and all of his army returned to Jerusalem.
Amnon raped Absalom’s sister
13
1 David’s son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar. Another of David’s sons,
Amnon, was attracted to Tamar.
2 He wanted to have sex with [EUP] his half-sister very much, with the result that he
made himself sick thinking about her all the time. But it was not possible for Amnon
to get her, because she was a virgin, so they kept men away from her.
3 But Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, who was the son of David’s brother
Shimeah. Jonadab was a very crafty/shrewd man.
4 One day Jonadab said to Amnon, “You are the king’s son, but every day I see that
[RHQ] you seem very depressed/sad. What is your problem?” Amnon replied, “I ◄am
in love/want to sleep► [EUP] with Tamar, my half-brother Absalom’s sister.”
5 Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed, and pretend that you are sick. When
your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Allow my half-sister Tamar to come and
give me some food to eat. She can prepare the food while I am watching her. Then
she can serve it to me herself.’ ”
6 So Amnon lay down, and pretended that he was sick. When the king came to see
him, Amnon said to him, “I am sick; please allow my half-sister Tamar to come and
2 SAMUEL 13:7
456
2 SAMUEL 13:25
make a couple scones/dumplings for me while I am watching, and then she can serve
them to me.”
7 So David sent a message to Tamar in the palace, saying “Amnon is sick and he
wants you to go to his house and prepare some food for him.”
and kneaded it, and formed it into some scones/dumplings while he was watching
9 She took them out of the pan and put them on a plate in front of him, but he
refused to eat them. Then he said to everyone else in the room, “All the rest of you,
leave me now!” So all the others left his room.
10 Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into my room and serve it to me.”
So Tamar took into his room the scones/dumplings that she had made.
11 But when she brought them close for him to eat them, he grabbed her and said
to her, “Come to bed with me!”
12 She replied, “No, do not force me to do such a disgraceful thing! We never do
things like that in Israel! That would be awful/terrible!
13 As for me, if I did that, I would not be able to [RHQ] endure being disgraced by
having done that. And as for you, everyone in Israel would condemn you for having
done such a disgraceful deed. So I plead with you, talk to the king. I am sure that he
will allow me to marry you.”
14 But he would not listen to her. He was stronger than she was, so he forced her
to have sex with him.
15 Then Amnon hated her very much. He hated her much more than he had desired
her. He said to her, “Get up and get out of here!”
16 But she said to him, “No! It would be very wrong for you to send me away. It
would be worse than what you just did to me!” But he would not listen to her.
17 He summoned his personal servant and said to him, “Take this woman outside,
away from me, and lock the door so that she cannot come in again!”
18 So the servant put her outside and locked the door.
Tamar was wearing a long robe with long sleeves, which was the clothing that was
usually worn by the unmarried daughters of the king at that time.
19 But Tamar tore the long robe that she was wearing, and put ashes on her head
to show that she was very sad. Then she put her hands on her head to show that she
was grieving, and she went away, crying.
20 Her brother Absalom saw her and said to her, “Has your half-brother Amnon
[DOU] forced you to have sex with him [EUP]? Please, my sister, do not tell anyone,
and do not become depressed/sad.” So Tamar went to live in Absalom’s house, and
she was very sad and lonely.
21 When King David heard about all that, he became very angry.
22 And Absalom hated Amnon, because he had raped his sister, so he would not
speak to Amnon about anything.
23 Two years later, Absalom’s servants were shearing sheep at Baal-Hazor, which is
near a town named Ephraim. When they finished shearing the sheep, they celebrated,
and Absalom invited all the king’s sons to come and celebrate.
24 Absalom went to the king and said to him, “Sir, my servants have been shearing
my sheep. Please come with your officials to celebrate with us!”
25 But the king replied, “No, my son, it would not be good for all of us to go, because
it would cause you to do a lot of work and spend a lot of money for food.” Absalom
continued urging him, but the king would not go. Instead, he said that he hoped/
desired that God would bless them while they celebrated.
2 SAMUEL 13:26
457
2 SAMUEL 14:5
26 Then Absalom said, “If you will not go, please allow my half-brother Amnon to
go with us.” But the king replied, “Why do you want him to go with you?”
David’s other sons to go with Absalom.
“Notice when Amnon has become a bit drunk from the wine. Then when I signal
to you, kill him. Do not be afraid; you will be doing this only because I told you
[RHQ] to do it. So be courageous and do it!”
29 So Absalom’s servants did what Absalom told them to do. They killed Amnon. All
the rest of David’s sons saw what happened and fled, riding on their mules.
30 While they were on their way home, someone went quickly and reported to David,
“Absalom has killed all of your other sons; none of them is still alive!”
31 The king stood up, tore his clothes because he was extremely sad, and then he
threw himself down on the ground. All the servants who were there also tore their
clothes.
32 But Jonadab, the son of David’s brother Shimeah, said, “Your Majesty, I am sure
that they have not killed all your sons. I am sure that only Amnon is dead, because
Absalom has determined to do this ever since the day that Amnon raped [EUP] his
half-sister Tamar.
33 So, your majesty, do not believe the report that all your sons are dead. I am sure
that only Amnon is dead.”
34 In the meantime, Absalom ran away.
Just then, the soldier/sentry who was standing on the city wall saw a large crowd
of people coming down the hill along the road from Horonaim. He ran and told the
king what he had seen.
35 Jonadab said to the king, “Aha! What I told you is true. Your other sons are alive
and have come!”
36 And as soon as he said that, David’s sons came in. They all started crying, and
David and all his officials also cried very much.
37-38 But Absalom had fled. He went to stay with the king of the Geshur region, who
was Talmai the son of Ammihud. Absalom stayed there for three years.
David mourned for his son Amnon for a long time,
39 but after that, he desired very much to see Absalom, because he was no longer
grieving about Amnon being dead.
14
Joab cleverly arranged for Absalom to return
1 Joab realized that the king yearned [IDM] to see Absalom.
2 So Joab sent someone to Tekoa town to bring back a woman who was very clever.
When she arrived, Joab said to her, “Pretend that you are grieving because someone
has died. Put on clothes that show that you are mourning. Do not put any lotion/
ointment on your body. Act as if you are a woman who has been mourning for a long
time.
to say [MTY] to the king.
and then bowed down to him, and said, “Your Majesty, help me!”
5 The king replied, “What is your problem?” She replied, “Please, sir, I am a widow.
My husband died some time ago.
2 SAMUEL 14:6
6 I had two sons.
458
2 SAMUEL 14:22
But one day they quarreled with each other out in the fields.
There was no one to separate them, and one of them struck the other one and killed
him.
7 Now, all my family oppose me. They are insisting that I allow them to kill my son
who is still alive [MTY], in order that they may get revenge for his killing his brother.
But if they do that, I will not have any son to inherit my husband’s possessions. That
would be like [MET] extinguishing the last coals of a fire, and my husband would not
have a son to preserve our family’s name. [DOU]”
8 Then the king said to the woman, “Go back home; I will take care of this matter
for you.”
9 The woman from Tekoa replied to the king, “Your Majesty, if you are criticized for
helping me, my family and I will accept the blame. You and the royal family will ◄be
innocent/not have done what is wrong►.”
10 The king said to her, “If anyone says anything to threaten you/cause you trouble
you, bring that person to me, and I will make sure that he will never cause you trouble
again.”
11 Then the woman said, “Your Majesty, please pray that Yahweh your God will not
allow my relative, who wants to get revenge on my son for killing [MTY] his brother,
to be able to do that.”
David replied, “As surely as Yahweh lives, your son will not be harmed at all. [IDM]”
12 Then the woman said, “Your Majesty, please allow me to say one more thing to
you.” He replied, “Speak!”
13 The woman said, “Why have you done this bad thing to God’s people? You have
not allowed your son Absalom to return home. By saying what you have just said,
you have certainly declared [RHQ] that what you have done is wrong.
14 We all die; we are like [SIM] water that cannot be picked up after it is spilled on
the ground. But God does not just cause us to die; he creates ways to bring us back
when we become separated from him.
15 “Now, Your Majesty, I have come to you because others have threatened me. So
I said to myself, ‘I will go and talk to the king, and perhaps he will do what I request
him to do.
16 Perhaps he will listen to me, and save me from the man who is trying to kill my
son. If my son is killed, it would result in us disappearing from the land that God
gave to us.’
17 “And I thought, ‘What the king says will comfort/encourage me, because the king
is like [SIM] an angel of God. He knows what is good and what is evil.’ I pray/desire
that Yahweh our God will ◄be with/direct► you.”
18 Then the king said to the woman, “I will now ask you a question. Answer it, and
tell me the truth. [LIT]” The woman replied, “Your majesty, ask your question.”
19 The king said, “Was Joab the one who told you to do this?” She replied, “Yes, Your
Majesty, as surely as you live, I cannot avoid telling you what is true. Yes, indeed, it
was Joab who told me to come here, and who told me what to say.
20 He did it in order to cause you to think differently about this matter. Your Majesty,
you are as wise as God’s angels, and it seems that you know everything that happens
21 Then the king summoned Joab and said to him, “Listen! I have decided to do what
22 Joab prostrated himself on the ground, and then he bowed down before the king,
pleased with me, because you have agreed to do what I requested.”
2 SAMUEL 14:23
459
2 SAMUEL 15:5
23 Then Joab got up and went to Geshur, and got Absalom and brought him back to
Jerusalem.
24 But the king said/commanded that Absalom would not be permitted to live in the
palace. He said, “I do not want him to come to see me.” So Absalom lived in his own
house, and did not go to talk to the king.
25 Absalom was very handsome. He looked perfect, from the bottom of his feet to
the top of his head. In all of Israel there was no one whom people admired more
than Absalom.
26 His hair was very thick, and he cut it only once each year, when it became too
heavy for him. Using the standard weights, he would weigh the hair that he cut off,
and it always weighed about five pounds.
27 Absalom had three sons and one daughter named Tamar. She was a very
beautiful woman.
28 After Absalom returned to Jerusalem, he lived there two years, and during that
time he never was allowed to see the king.
29 So he sent a messenger to Joab to ask him to come and talk to him, but Joab
refused to come. So Absalom sent a message to him a second time, but he still would
not come.
30 Then Absalom said to his servants, “You know that Joab’s field is next to mine,
and that he has barley growing there. Go and light a fire there to burn his barley.” So
Absalom’s servants went there and lit a fire, and all his barley burned.
31 Joab knew who had done it, so he went to Absalom’s house and said to him, “Why
have your servants burned the barley in my field?”
32 Absalom replied, “Because you did not come to me when I sent messages to you
requesting that you come. I wanted to request that you go to the king to say to him,
‘Absalom ◄wants to know what good it did/says that is was useless► [RHQ] for him
[RHQ] to leave Geshur and come here. He thinks that it would have been better for
him to have stayed there. He wants you to allow him to talk to you. And if you think
that he has done something that is wrong, you can command that he be executed.’ ”
33 So Joab went to the king, and told him what Absalom had said. Then the king
summoned Absalom, and he came to the king and knelt down in front of him with his
face touching the ground. Then the king kissed Absalom to show that he was pleased
to see him.
15
Absalom rebelled against David
1 Some time later, Absalom acquired a chariot and horses to pull it.
He hired 50
men to run in front of him to honor him while he was riding around Jerusalem in the
chariot.
2 Furthermore, he always rose early each morning and stood by the city gate.
Whenever someone came there with a dispute/quarrel that he wanted the king to
person told him what city and tribe he was from,
right. But there is no one whom the king has appointed/authorized to listen to people
4 Absalom would then add, “I wish that I were a judge in this land. If I were a judge,
anyone who had a dispute could come to me, and I would decide it fairly/justly.”
5 And whenever anyone came near to Absalom to bow respectfully in front of him,
Absalom would reach out and embrace him and kiss him.
2 SAMUEL 15:6
460
2 SAMUEL 15:24
6 Absalom did this to everyone in Israel who came to the king because of having
a dispute with someone. In that way, Absalom persuaded all the Israeli people to be
more pleased with him [IDM] than they were pleased with David.
7 Four years later, Absalom went to the king and said, “Please allow me to go to
Hebron city, in order that I can do what I promised Yahweh that I would do.
8 When I was living in Geshur, in Syria, I promised Yahweh that if he brought me
back to Jerusalem, I would worship him in Hebron.”
9 The king replied, “You may go.” So Absalom went to Hebron.
10 But while he was there, he secretly sent messengers to all the tribes in Israel, to
tell them, “When you hear the sound of the trumpets being blown, shout ‘Absalom
has become the king at Hebron!’ ”
11 Absalom had taken with him to Hebron 200 men from Jerusalem, but they did
not know what Absalom was planning to do.
12 While Absalom was offering sacrifices at Hebron, he sent a message to Ahithophel,
from Giloh town, requesting him to come. Ahithophel was one of the king’s advisors.
So the number of people who joined Absalom and who were ready to rebel against
David became larger.
David escaped from Jerusalem
13 Soon a messenger came to David and said to him, “All [HYP] the Israeli people
[SYN] are joining Absalom to rebel against you!”
14 So David said to all his officials, “We must leave immediately if we want to escape
from Absalom! We must go quickly, before he and his men arrive. If we do not do
that, they will kill us and everyone else in the city!”
15 The king’s officials said, “Okay, your majesty, we are ready to do whatever you
decide.”
16 So the king left ten of his slave wives there to take care of the palace, but all the
other people in his palace went with him.
17 When they all were leaving the city, they stopped at the last house.
18 The king and his officials stood there while his bodyguards went by in front of
him. 600 soldiers from Gath city also walked by in front of him.
19 Then David said to Ittai, the leader of the soldiers from Gath, “◄Why are you going
with us?/You should not be going with us.► [RHQ] Go back and stay with Absalom the
new king. You are not an Israeli; you are living away from your own land.
20 You have lived here in Israel for only a short time [HYP]. And we do not even
around with us. And take your troops with you. And I hope/wish that Yahweh will
21 But Ittai replied, “Your Majesty, as surely as you live, wherever you go, I will go;
I will stay with you, whether they kill me or allow me to live.”
22 David replied to Ittai, “Okay, march with us!” So Ittai and all his troops and their
families went with David.
23 All the people along the road cried when they saw them walking by. The king
and all the others crossed the Kidron Valley and then they all went up the hill toward
the desert.
24 Abiathar and Zadok, the priests, were walking with them. The descendants of Levi
who helped the priests also went with them, carrying the sacred chest that contained
the Ten Commandments. But they set it on the ground until all the others had left
the city.
2 SAMUEL 15:25
461
2 SAMUEL 16:4
25 Then the king said to Zadok, “You and Abiathar take the sacred chest back into
the city. If Yahweh is pleased with me, he will some day allow me to return to see it
and the place where it is kept.
26 But if he says that he is not pleased with me, then I am willing for him to do to
me whatever he thinks is good.”
27 He also said to Zadok, “Listen to what I suggest. You and Abiathar return to the
city peacefully/safely, and take your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan with
you.
28 I will wait in the desert at the place where people can walk across the river, until
you send a message to me.”
29 So Zadok and Abiathar carried the sacred chest back to Jerusalem, and they
stayed there.
30 David and those with him went up Olive Tree Hill. David was crying while he
walked. He was walking barefoot and had something covering his head to show that
he was sorrowful. All those who were going with him also covered their heads and
were crying while they walked.
31 Someone told David that Ahithophel had joined with those who were rebelling
against David. So David prayed, “Yahweh, cause whatever Ahithophel suggests to
Absalom that he should do to be considered to be foolish!”
32 When they arrived at the top of the hill, where there was a place where the
people worshiped God, suddenly Hushai, from the Arki people-group, met David. He
had torn his clothes and put dirt on his head to show that he was very sad.
33 David said to him, “If you go with me, you will not be able to help me.
34 But if you return to the city, you can help me by saying to Absalom, ‘Your Majesty,
I will serve you as faithfully as I served your father.’ If you do that and stay near
Absalom, you will be able to oppose any advice that Ahithophel gives to Absalom.
35 Zadok and Abiathar the priests are already there [RHQ]. Whatever you hear
people say in the king’s palace, tell it to Zadok and Abiathar.
36 Keep in mind that Zadok’s son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan are also
there. You can tell them whatever you find out, and send them to report it to me.”
37 So David’s friend Hushai returned to the city, at the same time that Absalom was
Ziba gave food to David and the others
Mephibosheth’s servant Ziba met him. He had with him two donkeys that were
fruit, and a leather bag full of wine.
2 The king said to Ziba, “What are these for?” Ziba replied, “The donkeys are for
your family to ride on, the bread and the fruit are for your soldiers to eat, and the
wine is for them to drink when they become exhausted in the desert.”
Ziba deceived David by saying, “He stayed in Jerusalem, because he thinks that now
the Israeli people will allow him to rule the kingdom that his grandfather Saul ruled.”
4 The king said to Ziba, “Okay, everything that belonged to Mephibosheth is now
yours.” Ziba replied, “Your Majesty, I will humbly serve you; and I desire/hope that
you will always be pleased with me.”
1 When
Shimei cursed David
2 SAMUEL 16:5
462
2 SAMUEL 16:22
5 When King David and those with him arrived at Bahurim town, a man named
Shimei met him. Shimei, whose father was Gera, was one of Saul’s relatives. Shimei
was cursing David as he approached.
6 Then he threw stones at David and his officials, even though the officials and
David’s bodyguards surrounded David.
7 Shimei cursed David and said to him, “Get out of here, you murderer, you
scoundrel!
8 Yahweh is ◄getting revenge on/punishing► you all for murdering [MTY] many
people in Saul’s family. And now he is giving Saul’s kingdom to your son Absalom.
You murderer, you are being paid back for the many people that you have killed/
murdered [MTY]!”
9 Then Abishai said to the king, “Your Majesty, this man is as worthless as [MET]
a dead dog! ◄Why should he be allowed to curse you?/He should not be allowed to
curse you.► [RHQ] Allow me to go over there and cut off his head!”
10 But the king replied, “You two sons of Zeruiah, ◄do not tell me what to do/this
does not concern you► [RHQ]. If he is cursing me because Yahweh told him to do
that, certainly no one should say ‘◄Why are you doing that?/You should not be doing
that.► [RHQ]’ ”
11 Then David said to Abishai and to all his officials, “You know that my own son
is trying to kill me. So it is not surprising that this man from the tribe of Benjamin is
also trying to kill me. So ignore him, and allow him to curse me, because perhaps he
thinks that Yahweh told him to do that.
12 Perhaps Yahweh will see that I am having all this trouble, and some day he will
repay me by ◄blessing/doing good things for► me in return for this man cursing me
today.”
13 Then David and those who were with him walked along the road, and Shimei
continued walking along the hillside near him. While he walked along, he cursed
14 When David and those who were with him arrived at the Jordan River, they were
Ahithophel gave advice to Absalom
15 While that was happening, Absalom and all the Israeli people who were with
him had arrived in Jerusalem. Ahithophel had also arrived there.
16 When David’s friend Hushai came to Absalom, he said to Absalom, “I desire/hope
that the king will live a long time! May you live for many years!”
17 Absalom said to Hushai, “You have been loyal [RHQ] to your friend David for a
long time. So why did you not go with him instead of coming to me?”
18 Hushai replied, “I will serve the one whom Yahweh and these people and all the
other people of Israel have chosen to be their king. So I will stay with you.
19 You are my master King David’s son; if I do not serve you, what other man should
I serve [RHQ]? I will serve you as I served your father.”
20 Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “What do you advise that we should do?”
21 Ahithophel replied, “Your father left some of his slave wives in the palace to take
care of it. Have sex [EUP] with them. When everyone in Israel hears that you have
done that, they will realize that you are acting very contemptuously toward your
father. Then all those who are with you will be very encouraged.”
22 So they set up a tent for Absalom on the roof of the palace. And Absalom went
into the tent and had sex [EUP] with his father’s slave wives, one by one, and everyone
[HYP] could see him going into the tent.
2 SAMUEL 16:23
463
2 SAMUEL 17:15
23 In those days, people accepted what Ahithophel recommended as though he were
speaking the words of God. So just as David had always accepted what Ahithophel
said, now Absalom did also.
17
1 Then Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Allow me to choose 12,000 men, and I will
leave with them tonight to pursue David.
2 We will attack him while he is tired and discouraged, and cause him to be very
frightened. All the soldiers who are with him will run away. We will kill only the
king.
3 Then we will bring back all his soldiers to you, like [SIM] a ◄bride/woman comes
to her husband when she is married►. You are wanting to kill only one man; so the
other people will not be harmed.”
4 Absalom and all the Israeli leaders who were with him thought that what
Ahithophel said would be good to do.
5 But Absalom said, “Summon Hushai also, and we will hear what he suggests.”
6 So when Hushai arrived, Absalom told him what Ahithophel had suggested. Then
he asked Hushai, “What do you think we should do? If you do not think that we
should do what Ahithophel suggests, tell us what you think that we should do.”
8 You know that your father and the men who are with him are strong soldiers,
stolen from her. Furthermore, your father knows how to fight because he has fought
9 Right now he is probably already hiding in one of the pits, or in some other place.
If his soldiers start to attack your soldiers, and if they kill some of them, whoever
hears about that will say ‘Many of the soldiers with Absalom have been killed!’
10 Then your other soldiers, even if they are as fearless [SIM, IDM] as lions, they
will become very afraid. Do not forget that everyone in Israel knows that your father
is a great/strong soldier, and that the soldiers who are with him are also very brave/
courageous.
11 “So what I suggest is that you summon all the Israeli soldiers, from Dan in the
far north to Beersheba in the far south. They will be as many as the grains of sand
on the seashore [HYP]. And then you yourself lead us into the battle.
12 We will find your father, wherever he is, and we will attack him from all sides,
like [SIM] dew covers all the ground. And neither he nor any of the soldiers who are
with him will survive.
13 If he escapes into some city, all our soldiers will bring ropes and pull that city
down into the valley. As a result, not one stone will be left there on top of the hill
where that city was!”
14 Absalom and all the other Israeli men who were with him said, “What Hushai
suggests is better than what Ahithophel suggested.” The reason that happened
was that Yahweh had determined that if they would accept the good advice that
Ahithophel had given them, they would have been able to defeat/kill David. But as a
result of their doing what Hushai suggested, Yahweh would cause a disaster to happen
to Absalom.
Hushai arranged for a report to be sent to David
Hushai told the two priests, Zadok and Abiathar, what both he and
Ahithophel had suggested to Absalom and the Israeli leaders.
15 Then
2 SAMUEL 17:16
464
2 SAMUEL 17:29
16 Then he said to them, “Send a message quickly to David. Tell him to not stay at
the place where people walk across the river, near the desert. Instead, he and his
soldiers must cross the Jordan River immediately, in order that they will not be killed/
wiped out.”
17 The priest’s two sons, Jonathan and Ahimaaz, were waiting at En-Rogel Spring,
outside Jerusalem. They did not dare to enter the city, because if someone saw them,
he would report it to Absalom. While they were at En-Rogel, a female servant of the
two priests would frequently go to them and report to them what was happening, and
then they would go and report it to King David.
18 But a young man saw them, and went and reported it to Absalom. They found
out what the young man had done, so both of them left quickly and went to stay in
the house of a man in Bahurim. That man had a well in his courtyard; so the two
men went down into the well to hide.
19 The man’s wife took a cloth/mat and covered the well, and scattered grain on top
of it in order that no one would know that two men were hiding inside it.
20 Some of Absalom’s soldiers found out where the two men had gone. So they went
to the house, and asked the woman, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”
So the soldiers crossed the river and searched for them. But they could not find
21 After they had gone, the two men came out of the well and went and reported to
to him, “Cross the river quickly!”
22 So David and all his soldiers quickly started to cross the Jordan River, and by
dawn they had all crossed to the other side.
23 When Ahithophel realized that Absalom was not going to do what he suggested,
he put a saddle on his donkey and returned to his own town. He gave to his family
instructions about his possessions, and then he hanged himself because he knew that
Absalom would be defeated and that he would be considered a traitor and be killed. His
body was buried in the tomb where his ancestors had been buried.
24 David and his soldiers arrived at Mahanaim. And Absalom and all his Israeli
soldiers also crossed the Jordan River.
25 Absalom had appointed his cousin Amasa to be the commander of his army,
instead of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Jether, a descendant of Ishmael.
Amasa’s mother was Abigail, the daughter of Nahash and the sister of Joab’s mother
Zeruiah.
26 Absalom and his Israeli soldiers set up their tents in the Gilead region.
27 When David and his soldiers arrived at Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from
Rabbah city in the Ammon area, and Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-Debar city,
and Barzillai from Rogelim town in the Gilead region
28 brought sleeping mats, bowls, clay pots, barley, wheat flour, parched grain, beans,
and lentils to them.
29 They brought honey and curds, sheep, and some cream/cheese for David and his
soldiers to eat. They knew that David and his soldiers would be hungry and tired and
thirsty from marching in the desert.
18
David’s men prepared for the battle
2 SAMUEL 18:1
465
2 SAMUEL 18:18
1 David arranged his soldiers for the battle.
He divided them into groups, and
appointed a commander for each 100 soldiers and a commander for each 1,000
soldiers.
2 He sent them out in three groups. Joab commanded one group, Joab’s brother
Abishai commanded a second group, and Ittai from Gath commanded the third group.
David said to them, “I myself will go with you to the battle.”
3 But his soldiers said, “No, we will not allow you to go with us. If they force us all
to run away, they will not be concerned about that happening. Or if they kill half of
us, that will also not be what they want. To them, killing you is more important than
killing 10,000 of us. So it will be better that you stay here in the city and send help to
us.”
4 The king replied, “Okay, I will do whatever seems best to you.” So he stood at the
gate and watched while his soldiers marched out, group by group.
5 While they were leaving, the king commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, “For my
sake, do not harm my son Absalom!” And all the troops heard it when David gave
Joab killed Absalom
6 So the army went out to fight against the Israeli soldiers who were with Absalom.
They fought the battle in the forest where people from the tribe of Ephraim lived.
7 David’s soldiers defeated Absalom’s soldiers. They killed 20,000 of them!
8 The battle was fought {They fought the battle} all over that area, and the number
of men who died because of dangerous things in the forest [PRS] was greater than the
number of men who were killed ◄in the battle/by swords►.
9 During the battle, Absalom suddenly came near some of David’s soldiers. Absalom
was riding on his mule; and when the mule went under the thick branches of a large
oak tree, Absalom’s head/hair was caught in the branches. The mule kept going, but
Absalom was left dangling in the air.
10 One of David’s soldiers saw what happened, and went and told Joab, “I saw
Absalom hanging in an oak tree!”
11 Joab said to the man, “What? You say that you saw him hanging there, so why
did you not kill him immediately [RHQ]? If you had killed him, I would have given
you ten pieces of silver and a belt!”
12 The man replied to Joab, “Even if you gave me 1,000 pieces of silver, I would not
have done anything to harm [IDM] the king’s son. We all heard the king command
you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘For my sake, do not harm my son Absalom!’
13 If I had disobeyed the king and killed Absalom, the king would have heard about
it, because the king hears about everything, and even you would not have defended
me!”
14 Joab said, “I am not going to waste time talking to you!” Then he took three
spears and went to where Absalom was, and thrust them into Absalom’s chest/heart
while he was still alive, dangling from the oak tree.
15 Then ten young men who carried weapons for Joab surrounded Absalom and
finished killing him.
16 Then Joab blew his trumpet to signal that they should not fight any more, and his
soldiers returned from pursuing those Israeli soldiers.
17 They took Absalom’s body and threw it into a huge pit in the forest, and covered
it with a huge pile of stones. Then all the remaining Israeli soldiers who had been
with Absalom fled to their own towns.
18 Absalom had no sons to preserve his family name. So, while Absalom was alive,
he built a monument to himself in the King’s Valley near Jerusalem, in order that
2 SAMUEL 18:19
466
2 SAMUEL 18:33
people would remember him. He put his name on the monument, and people still call
it Absalom’s monument.
The report of Absalom’s death reached David
19 After Absalom had been killed, Zadok’s son Ahimaaz said to Joab, “Allow me to
run to the king to tell him the good news that Yahweh has rescued him from the
20 But Joab said to him, “No, I will not allow you to take news to the king today.
today it would not be good news for the king, because his son is dead.”
king what you have seen.” So the man from Ethiopia bowed in front of Joab, and
22 Then Ahimaaz said again to Joab, “Even though that man from Ethiopia is running,
allow me to run behind him.” Joab replied, “My boy/son, why do you want to do that?
You will not receive any reward for your news!”
23 But Ahimaaz replied, “That does not matter, I want to go.” So Joab said, “Okay,
go.” So Ahimaaz ran along another road through the Jordan Valley and arrived where
David was before the man from Ethiopia arrived.
24 David was sitting between the outer gate and the inner gate of the city. The
watchman/lookout went up on top of the city wall and stood on the roof over the
gates. He looked out and saw one man running alone.
25 The watchman called down and reported it to the king. The king said, “If he
is alone, that indicates/means that he is bringing good news.” The man who was
running continued to come closer.
26 Then the watchman saw another man running. So he called down to the
gatekeeper, “Look! There is another man running!” And the king said, “He also
is bringing some good news.”
27 The watchman said, “I think the first man must be Ahimaaz, because he is running
like Ahimaaz runs.” The king said, “He is a good man, and I am sure he is coming
with good news.”
28 When Ahimaaz reached the king, he called out “I hope/desire that things will go
well with you!” Then he prostrated himself on the ground in front of the king and
were rebelling against you!”
29 The king said, “Is the young man Absalom safe/all right?” Ahimaaz did not want
of confusion, but I do not know what it was about.”
31 Suddenly the man from Ethiopia arrived, and said, “Your Majesty, I have good
news for you! Yahweh has enabled your soldiers to defeat all those who rebelled
against you!”
32 The king said to him, “Is the young man Absalom safe/all right?” And the man
from Ethiopia replied, “Sir, I wish/desire that what happened to him would happen
to all of your enemies and to all those who rebel against you!”
33 The king realized that he meant that Absalom was dead, so he became ◄extremely
distressed/overcome with grief►, and he went up to the room above the gateway and
cried. While he was going up, he kept crying out, “O, my son Absalom! My son! O,
my son Absalom, I desire/wish that I had died instead of you!”
2 SAMUEL 19:1
467
2 SAMUEL 19:14
19
Joab rebuked the king
1 Someone told Joab that the king was crying and mourning because Absalom had
died.
2 All of David’s soldiers became sad. Instead of rejoicing about defeating the soldiers
who had fought with Absalom, they were sad because they heard that the king was
mourning because Absalom was dead.
3 The soldiers returned to the city quietly, like [SIM] soldiers do when they are
ashamed because they ran away from battle.
4 The king covered his face with his hands and kept crying loudly, “O, my son
5 Then Joab entered the room where the king was, and said to the king, “Today you
your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and your ordinary wives and your
slave wives!
6 It seems that you love those who hate you and that you hate those who love you.
You have caused it to be clear today that your commanders and your officers are not
at all important to you. I think that if Absalom were still alive and we were all dead
today, you would be happy.
7 So, now go and thank your soldiers for what they did. Because I solemnly
declare that if you do not do that, none of them will still be with you by tomorrow
morning and that would be worse for you than all the disasters/troubles that you
have experienced since you were a boy.”
8 So the king got up and went and sat near the city gate. And all the people were
told, “Hey, the king is sitting at the gate!” So they all came and gathered around him.
The people of Israel and Judah wanted David to be their king again
Meanwhile, all the Israeli troops who had been with Absalom had returned to their
homes.
9 Then all the people throughout the tribes of Israel started to quarrel among
themselves. They said to each other, “King David rescued us from the people of
Philistia and from our other enemies. But now he has fled from Absalom and left
Israel!
10 We appointed [MTY] Absalom to be our king, but he died in the battle against
David’s soldiers. So ◄why does someone not try to bring King David back?/surely
someone should try to bring King David back.►” [RHQ]
11 King David found out what the people were saying. So he sent the two priests,
Zadok and Abiathar, to say to the leaders of Judah, “The king says that he has heard
that all the Israeli people want him to be king again. And he says, ‘◄Why should you
be the last ones to bring me back to my palace?/It is not right that you be the last
ones to bring me back to my palace.► [RHQ]
12 You are my relatives; we have the same ancestor [IDM]. So ◄why should you be
the last ones to bring me back?/you should certainly not be the last ones to bring me
back.► [RHQ]’ ”
13 And say to Amasa, “You are one of my relatives. I hope/desire that God strike me
dead [IDM] if I do not appoint you to be, from now on, the commander of my army
instead of Joab.”
14 By sending that message to them, David convinced all the people of Judah [IDM]
that they should ◄be loyal to him/accept him as their king►. So they sent a message
to the king, saying “We want you and all your officials to return here.”
2 SAMUEL 19:15
468
15 So the king and his officials started back toward Jerusalem.
2 SAMUEL 19:33
When they reached
the Jordan River, the people of Judah came there to Gilgal to meet the king, and to
bring him across the river.
16 Shimei, the man from the tribe of Benjamin, also came down quickly to the river
17 There were 1,000 men from the tribe of Benjamin who came with him. And Ziba,
of his servants with him. They all came to the king,
at the place where they could walk across it. They wanted to do whatever the king
prostrated himself in front of the king.
19 He said to the king, “Your Majesty, please forgive me. Please do not keep thinking
about the terrible thing that I did on the day that you left Jerusalem. Do not think
about it any more.
20 Because I know that I have sinned. Look, I have come today, the first one from
the northern tribes to come here to greet you today, Your Majesty.”
21 But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said, “He cursed the one that Yahweh appointed
[MTY] to be the king! So ◄should he not be executed for doing that?/he certainly
should be executed for doing that.►” [RHQ]
22 But David said, “You sons of Zeruiah, what am I going to do with you? (OR, you
are not the ones who should decide what to do to him). It is as though you have
become my enemies today. I know that I am the one who has now become the king
of Israel, so I say that certainly no one [RHQ] in Israel should be executed today.”
23 Then the king said to Shimei, “I solemnly promise that I will not execute you.”
24 Then Miphibosheth, Saul’s grandson, came down to the river to greet the king.
He had not washed his feet or trimmed his beard or washed his clothes, from the
time that the king left Jerusalem until the day that he returned.
25 When he arrived from Jerusalem to greet the king, the king said to him,
“Mephibosheth, why did you not go with me?”
26 He replied, “Your Majesty, you know that I am crippled. When I heard that you
were leaving Jerusalem, I said to my servant Ziba, ‘Put a saddle on my donkey in order
that I can ride on it and go with the king.’ But he deceived me and left without me.
27 And he lied to you about me. But, Your Majesty, you are as wise as God’s angel.
So do whatever seems right to you.
28 All of my grandfather’s family expected/deserved that we would be executed.
But you did not execute me; you allowed me to eat food with you at your table! So I
certainly do not have [RHQ] the right to request you for anything more.”
29 The king replied, “You certainly do not need to say any more. I have decided that
you and Ziba will divide equally the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul.”
30 Mephibosheth replied to the king, “Your Majesty, I am content that you have
returned safely. So allow him to take all the land.”
31 Barzillai, the man from the Gilead region, had come down to the Jordan River
from his town of Rogelim, to escort the king across the river.
32 Barzillai was a very old man, 80 years old. He was a very wealthy man, and he
had provided food for the king and his soldiers while they were at Mahanaim.
33 The king said to Barzillai, “Come with me to Jerusalem, and I will take care of
you.”
2 SAMUEL 19:34
469
2 SAMUEL 20:3
34 But Barzillai replied, “I certainly do not have [RHQ] many more years to live. So
with you to Jerusalem.► [RHQ]
enjoyable. I cannot [RHQ] enjoy what I eat and what I drink. I cannot [RHQ] hear
you?/I do not want to be another burden to you.► [RHQ]
36 I will cross the Jordan River with you and go a little further, and that will be all
the reward that I need for helping you.
37 Then please allow me to return to my home, because that is where I want to die,
near my parents’ grave. But here is my son Chimham. Your Majesty, allow him to go
with you and serve you, and do for him whatever seems good to you!”
38 The king replied, “Okay, he will cross the river with me, and I will do for him
whatever seems good to you. And I will do for you whatever you want me to do.”
39 Then King David and all the others crossed the Jordan River. He kissed Barzillai
and asked God to bless him. Then Barzillai returned to his home.
40 After they crossed the river, Chimham went with the king, and all the army of
Judah and half the army of the other Israeli tribes escorted/accompanied the king to
Gilgal.
The troops from Judah and Israel argued
41 Then all the soldiers from the other Israeli tribes came to the king and said,
“◄Why is it that our relatives, the men from Judah, took you away from us and
wanted to be the only ones to escort you and your family across the river, along with
all your men?/It is not right that our relatives, the men from Judah, took you away
from us and wanted to be the only ones to escort you and your family across the
river, along with all your men.► [RHQ] Why did you not request us to do that?” [RHQ]
42 The soldiers from Judah replied, “We did it because the king is from Judah. So
◄why are you angry about that?/you should not be angry about that.► [RHQ] The
king has never paid for our food, and he has never given us any gifts.”
43 The men of the other Israeli tribes replied, “There are ten tribes in Israel, and only
one in Judah. So it is ten times more right for us to say that David is our king than it
is for you to say that. So why are you despising us [RHQ]? We were certainly [RHQ]
the first ones to talk about bringing David back to Jerusalem to be our king again.”
But the men of Judah spoke more harshly than the men from the other tribes of
Israel did.
Sheba rebelled against David
20
1 There was a man there at Gilgal named Sheba. He was a man who always caused
trouble. He was from the tribe of Benjamin and was the son of Bichri. He blew a
trumpet and called out, “We have nothing to do with [DOU] David, that son of Jesse!
So, men of Israel, let’s go to our homes!”
2 So all the men from the other Israeli tribes deserted David and went with Sheba,
but the men of Judah stayed with David. They wanted him to be their king, and went
with him from near the Jordan River up to Jerusalem.
3 When David arrived at the palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten slave wives whom
he had left there to take care of the palace and put them in another house. He put a
guard at that house, and he provided for them what they needed, but he never had
sexual relations [EUP] with them again. So they remained shut up in their house until
they died. It was as though they were widows.
2 SAMUEL 20:4
4 One day the king said to Amasa, “Summon the soldiers of Judah to come here
within three days, and you be here also.”
5 So Amasa went to summon them, but he did not return within the time that David
told him to.
6 So David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba will harm us more than Absalom did. So
you take my soldiers and pursue him. If you do not do that, he and his soldiers may
occupy/capture some of the ◄fortified towns/towns that have walls around them►,
and escape from us. [IDM]”
7 So Abishai and Joab and the king’s bodyguards and the other soldiers left
Jerusalem, to pursue Sheba.
8 When they arrived at the huge rock in the Gibeah region, Amasa met them. Joab
was wearing a soldier’s uniform. He had a dagger/long knife fastened to his belt.
When he came close to Amasa, he allowed the dagger to fall on the ground.
9 Joab said to Amasa, “Are things going well with you, my friend?” Then Joab
grabbed Amasa’s beard with his right hand, in order to kiss him.
10 But Amasa did not see that Joab was holding another dagger in his other hand.
And Joab stabbed it into Amasa’s belly, and his insides spilled out onto the ground.
Amasa died immediately; Joab did not need to stab him again. Then Joab and his
brother Abishai continued to pursue Sheba.
11 One of Joab’s soldiers stood alongside Amasa’s body and called out, “Everyone
who wants Joab to be our commander and who wants David to be our king, go with
Joab!”
12 Amasa’s body was lying on the road. It was covered with blood. The soldier of
Joab who had called out saw that many others of Joab’s soldiers were stopping to see
it, so he dragged Amasa’s body off the road into a field, and threw a cloth/blanket
over the body.
13 After the body had been taken off the road, all the soldiers went with Joab to
pursue Sheba.
14 Sheba went through all the tribes of Israel, and arrived at Abel-Beth-Maacah
town in the northern part of Israel. There, all the members of his father Bichri’s clan
gathered, and went with Sheba into the town.
15 The soldiers who were with Joab found out that Sheba had gone there, so they
went there and surrounded the town. They built a dirt ramp up against the town
wall. They also pounded against the wall with heavy poles, to cause it to collapse.
16 Then a wise woman who was in that town stood on the top of the wall and shouted
down, “Listen to me! Tell Joab to come here, because I want to talk to him!”
17 So after they told Joab, he came there, and the woman said, “Are you Joab?”
He replied, “Yes, I am.” She said to him, “Listen to what I say.” He replied, “I am
listening.”
18 She said, “Long ago people used to say, ‘Go to Abel town to get good advice about
your problems.’ And that is what people did.
19 We are peaceful and loyal Israelis. Our people here are important and respected
[IDM]. So ◄why are you trying to destroy a town that belongs to Yahweh?/you should
not be trying to destroy a town that belongs to Yahweh.►” [RHQ]
20 Job replied, “I would certainly never want to ruin or destroy your town!
21 That is not what we want to do. But Bichri’s son Sheba, a man from the hilly
area in the tribe of Ephraim, is rebelling against King David. Put this man into our
hands, and then we will ◄go away from/not attack► this town.”
throw it over the wall to you.”
2 SAMUEL 20:22
471
2 SAMUEL 21:12
22 Then this wise woman went to the elders of the town and told them what she
had said to Joab. So they cut off Sheba’s head and threw it over the wall to Joab.
Then Joab blew his trumpet to signal that the battle was ended, and all his soldiers
left the town and returned to their homes. And Joab returned to Jerusalem and told
the king what had happened.
23 Joab was the commander of the entire Israeli army. Jehoiada’s son Benaiah was
the commander of David’s bodyguards;
24 Adoram supervised the men who were forced to work for the king; Ahilud’s son
Jehoshaphat was the man who reported to the people everything that David decided;
25 Sheva was the official secretary; Zadok and Abiathar were the priests;
26 and Ira from Jair town was also one of David’s priests.
21
The people of Gibeon got revenge for what Saul did
1 During the time that David ruled, there was a famine in Israel for three years.
David prayed to Yahweh about it. And Yahweh said, “In order for the famine to
end, Saul’s family needs to be punished [MTY] because Saul killed many people from
Gibeon city.”
2 The people of Gibeon were not Israelis; they were a small group of the Amor
people-group whom the Israelis had solemnly promised to protect. But Saul had
tried to kill all of them because he ◄was very zealous/wanted very much► to enable
the people of Judah and Israel to be the only ones living in that land. So the king
summoned the leaders of Gibeon
was done to your people, in order that you will bless us who belong to Yahweh?”
4 They replied, “You cannot settle our quarrel with Saul and his family by giving us
silver or gold. And we do not have the right to kill any Israelis.”
So David asked, “Then/So what do you say that I should do for you?”
5 They replied, “Saul wanted to get rid of us. He wanted to annihilate/kill all of us,
in order that none of us would live anywhere in Israel.
6 Hand over to us seven of Saul’s descendants. We will hang them where Yahweh
is worshiped in Gibeon, our town, the town where Saul, whom Yahweh previously
chose to be king, lived.”
The king replied, “Okay, I will hand them over to you.”
7 The king did not hand over to them Saul’s grandson Mephibosheth, because of
what he and Mephibosheth’s father Jonathan had solemnly promised to each other.
8 Instead, he took Armoni and another man named Mephibosheth, the two sons
that Saul’s slave wife Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, had given birth to, and the five
sons that Saul’s daughter Merab had given birth to. Merab’s husband was Adriel, the
son of a man named Barzillai from Meholah town.
9 David handed those men over to the men from Gibeon. Then they hanged those
seven men on a hill where they worshiped Yahweh. They were all killed during the
time of the year that the people started to harvest the barley.
where the corpses lay. She stayed there from the time that people started to harvest
during the day, and she did not allow any animals to come near during the night.
12 he went with some of his servants to Jabesh in the Gilead region and got the
bones of Saul and his son Jonathan. The people of Jabesh had stolen their bones
2 SAMUEL 21:13
472
2 SAMUEL 22:4
from the ◄plaza/public square► in Beth-Shan city, where the men from Philistia had
hanged them previously, on the day that they had killed Saul and Jonathan on Gilboa
Mountain.
13 David and his men took the bones of Saul and Jonathan, and they also took the
bones of the seven men from Gibeon whom the men from Philistia had hanged.
14 They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan in Zela town in the land of the tribe
of Benjamin. Doing all that the king commanded, they buried their bones in the tomb
where Saul’s father Kish was buried. After that, because God saw that Saul’s family
had been punished to pay for Saul’s murder of many people from Gibeon, he answered
the Israelis’ prayers for their land, and caused the famine to end.
The battles against the giants of Philistia
15 The army of Philistia again started to fight against the army of Israel. And David
and his soldiers went to fight the Philistines. During the battle, David became weary.
16 One of the Philistia men thought that he could kill David. His name was IshbiBenob. He was a descendant of a group of giants. He carried a bronze spear that
weighed about ◄7-1/2 pounds/3-1/2 kg.►, and he also had a new sword.
17 But Abishai came to help David, and attacked the giant and killed him. Then
David’s soldiers forced him to promise that he would not go with them into a battle
again. They said to him, “If you die, and none of your descendants become king, that
would be like [MET] extinguishing the last light in Israel.”
18 Some time after that, there was a battle with the army of Philistia near Gob
village. During the battle, Sibbecai, from the Hushah clan, killed Saph, one of the
descendants of the Rapha giants.
19 Later there was another battle with the army of Philistia at Gob. During that
battle, Elhanan, the son of Jaare-Oregim from Bethlehem, killed the brother of Goliath
from Gath city; Goliath’s spear shaft/ handle was ◄very thick, like the bar on a
weaver’s loom/over two inches thick►.
20 Later there was another battle near Gath. There was a ◄huge man/giant► there
who liked to fight in battles. He had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each
foot. He was descended from the Rapha giants.
21 But when he ◄made fun of/ridiculed► the men in the Israeli army, Jonathan, the
son of David’s older brother Shimeah, killed him.
22 Those four men were some of the descendants of the Rapha giants who had lived
in Gath, who were killed [MTY] by David and his soldiers.
22
David’s song to praise Yahweh
1 After Yahweh had rescued David from Saul and his other enemies, David sang a
2 This is what he sang:
you are like my fortress, and you rescue me.
you are the powerful one [MET] who saves me;
you are like a place where I ◄find refuge/am safe►.
You save me from those who act violently toward me.
4 I call out to you, Yahweh;
you deserve to be praised,
and you rescue me from my enemies.
2 SAMUEL 22:5
473
2 SAMUEL 22:24
5 “ almost died [PRS]; it was like [MET] a huge wave had crashed over me,
and almost destroyed me like a flood.
6 I thought that I would die; it was as though death wrapped ropes around me;
it was as though I was in a trap where I would surely die. [PRS, MET]
7 But when I was ◄very distressed/in great trouble►, I called out to you, Yahweh;
I cried out to you, my God.
And from your temple you heard me;
you listened when I called to you to help me.
8 “Then it was as though the earth quaked and shook;
it was as though the foundations that ◄held up/supported► the sky trembled,
because you were angry.
9 It was as though smoke poured out of your nostrils
and burning coals and fire that burns everything came out of your mouth.
10 You tore open the sky and came down;
there was a thick dark cloud under your feet.
the wind enabled you to travel swiftly [MET], like a bird.
thick clouds that were full of water also surrounded you.
13 Out of the lightning in front of you
fire from burning coals flamed.
14 Then, Yahweh, you spoke like thunder from the sky;
it was your voice, God, you who are greater than all other gods, that was heard.
15 When you sent flashes of lightning,
it was as though [MET] you shot your arrows and scattered your enemies.
16 Then the bottom of the ocean was uncovered;
the foundations of the world could be seen
when you rebuked your enemies
with a snort from your nostrils.
17 “Yahweh, you reached down from heaven and lifted me up;
you pulled me up from the deep water.

you rescued me because you were pleased with me.

22 Yahweh, I have obeyed your laws;
I have not turned away from you, my God.
23 All of your regulations were in my mind,

I have kept myself from doing things for which I should be punished.
2 SAMUEL 22:25
474
2 SAMUEL 22:45
25 So you have rewarded me in return for my doing what is right,
because you know that I ◄am innocent of doing/have not done► wrong things.
26 “Yahweh, you are faithful/loyal to those who always trust in you;
you always do what is good to those whose behavior is always good.
27 You act sincerely toward those whose inner beings are pure,
but you are hostile to those who are perverse/wicked.
28 You rescue those who are humble,
but you watch [MTY] those who are proud and humiliate them.
29 Yahweh, you are like [MET] a lamp
that causes it to become light when I am in the dark.
30 With your strength/help I can run through a line of enemy soldiers
and I can climb over the wall that surrounds their city.
31 “My God whom I worship, everything that you do is perfect;
you always do what you promise that you will do.

I did not stop fighting them until they were all killed.
39 I struck them down; I stabbed them with my sword;
they fell down at my feet and did not stand up again.

and caused those who were attacking me to fall down, and I trampled on them.
41 You caused my enemies to turn and run away from me;
I destroyed those who hated me.
42 They ◄looked for/wanted► someone to rescue them, but no one did.
They cried out to you, Yahweh, for help, but you did not answer them.
43 I crushed them, and as a result they became like [SIM] tiny particles of dust.
I trampled them, and they became like [SIM] mud in the streets.
44 “You rescued me from those who tried to rebel against me,

You are the one who rescues me [MET].
Everyone should exalt/honor/praise you.
48 You enable me to conquer my enemies;
you cause people of other nations to be ◄under my authority/my slaves►.
49 You delivered me from my enemies;
you caused me to be honored more than they were;
you rescued me from men who always acted violently.
50 Because of all that, I exalt you among many people-groups
and I sing to praise you.
51 You enable me, whom you appointed to be king, to powerfully conquer my enemies;
you faithfully love me, David, and you will love my descendants forever.
23
David’s final message
1 David, the son of Jesse, was a man whom God caused to become great.
He was appointed to become king by the God whom Jacob worshiped.
He wrote beautiful songs for the Israeli people.
This is the last song that he wrote:
2 “The Spirit of Yahweh tells me what to say;
the message that I speak [MTY] comes from him.
3 God, the one whom we Israeli people worship, has spoken;
the one who protects us Israeli people said to me,
‘Kings who rule people justly
have an awesome respect for me, God.
4 They are like the sun that shines at dawn
and causes the grass to sprout/sparkle after the rain ends.’
5 And truly, that is how God will surely bless my family [RHQ]
because he made an agreement with me that will endure forever,
an agreement in which he promises that no part of it will ever be changed.
He will surely cause me to prosper [RHQ],
and that is all that I desire.
that injure people if they try to pick them up with their hands.
he uses an iron shovel or a spear to dig them out
and then he burns them completely.
David’s three greatest warriors
8 These are the names of David’s three greatest warriors.
The first was Esh-Baal, whose other name was Jashobeam, from the Hachmon clan
(OR, the son of Hachmon). He was the leader of the three men. One time he fought
against 800 enemies and killed them all with his spear.
2 SAMUEL 23:9
476
2 SAMUEL 23:24
9 The second/next one of the three greatest warriors was Eleazar, who was the
son of Dodo from the clan of Ahoh. One day he was with David when they defied/
challenged the soldiers of Philistia who had gathered for the battle. The other Israeli
soldiers retreated,
10 but Eleazar stood there and fought the soldiers of Philistia until his arm became
very tired, with the result that his hand cramped and he could not stop gripping his
sword. Yahweh won a great victory on that day. And afterwards the other Israeli
soldiers returned to where Eleazar was, and stripped off the armor from the men
whom he had killed.
11 The third one of the greatest warriors was Shammah, the son of Agee from the
clan/town of Harar. One time the Philistia soldiers gathered at Lehi town, where there
was a field full of lentils/peas that they wanted to steal. The other Israeli soldiers ran
away from the Philistia troops,
12 but Shammah stood there in the field and did not let the Philistia soldiers steal
the crops, and killed them. Yahweh won a great victory on that day.
The 30 great warriors
13 Altogether there were 30 special warriors among David’s soldiers.
Once, when
it was almost time to harvest the crops, three of those 30 men went down to Adullam
Cave, where David was staying. A group of men from the Philistia army had set up
their tents in Rephaim Valley near Jerusalem.
14 David and his soldiers were in the cave because it was safe there, and another
group of Philistia soldiers was occupying Bethlehem.
15 One day David very much wanted some water to drink, and said “I wish that
someone would bring me some water from the well near the gate at Bethlehem!”
16 So his three greatest warriors forced their way through the camp of Philistia
soldiers and drew some water from the well, and brought it to David. But he would
not drink it. Instead, he poured it out on the ground as an offering to Yahweh.
17 He said, “Yahweh, it would certainly not be right for me to drink this water! That
would be like [RHQ] drinking the blood of these men who were willing/ready to die
for me!” So he refused to drink it.
The list of the great warriors
18 Abishai, Joab’s younger brother, was the leader of the 30 greatest warriors. One
day he fought against 300 men and killed them all with his spear. As a result, he also
19 He was the most famous of the thirty greatest warriors, and he became their
leader/commander, but he was not one of the three greatest warriors.
20 Jehoiada’s son Benaiah, from Kabzeel town, also did great deeds. He killed two
of the best warriors from the Moab people-group. Also, he went down into a pit on a
day when snow was falling, and killed a lion there.
21 He also killed a huge soldier from Egypt who carried a spear. Benaiah had only
his club, but he attacked the giant with it. Then he snatched the spear from the man’s
hand and killed him with his own spear.
22 Those are some of the things that Benaiah did. As a result, he became famous,
like the three greatest warriors were.
23 He was more honored than the other members of the group of thirty great
warriors, but not as famous as the three greatest warriors. David appointed him
to be the commander of his bodyguards.
24 These are the names of the great warriors:

37 Zelek, from the Ammon people-group;
Naharai, the man who carried Joab’s weapons, from Beeroth town;
38 Ira and Gareb, from Jattir town;
39 Uriah, Bathsheba’s husband, from the Heth people-group.
Altogether, there were 37 famous soldiers, but some of them had died and their
names were not included.

David ordered a census to be taken
1 Yahweh was angry with the Israeli people again, so he incited David to cause
trouble for them. He said to David, “Send some men to count the people of Israel and
Judah.”
2 So the king said to Joab, the commander of his army, “Go with your officers through
all the tribes of Israel, from Dan city in the far north to Beersheba town in the far south,
and count the people, in order that I may know how many people there are who are
able to be soldiers in the army.”
3 But Joab replied to the king, “Your Majesty, I wish/desire that Yahweh our God
will cause there to be 100 times as many people in Israel as there are now, and I wish/
desire that you would see that happen before you die. But why do you want us to do
this?”
4 But the king commanded Joab and his officers to do it. So they left the king and
went out to count the people of Israel.
2 SAMUEL 24:5
478
2 SAMUEL 24:20
5 They crossed the Jordan River and set up their tents south of Aroer town, in the
middle of the valley, in the territory that was given to the tribe of Gad. From there
they went north to Jazer city
6 Then they went north to the Gilead region and to Kadesh city, in the land where
the Heth people-group lived. Then they went to Dan city in the far north of Israel, and
then further west, to Sidon city near the Mediterranean Sea.
7 Then they went south to Tyre, a city with high walls around it, and to all the cities
where the Hiv and Canaan people-groups live. Then they went east to Beersheba, in
the southern part of Judah.
8 After nine months and 20 days, when they had finished going throughout the land
and counting the people, they returned to Jerusalem.
9 They reported to the king the number of people that they had counted. There were
800,000 men in Israel and 500,000 men in Judah who were able to become soldiers
in the army [MTY].
10 But after David’s men had counted the people, David regretted [IDM] that he had
told them to do that. One night he said to Yahweh, “I have committed a very big sin.
Please forgive me, because what I have done is very foolish.”
11 When David got up the next morning, Yahweh gave a message to the prophet
Gad. He said to him,
12 “Go and tell this to David: ‘I am allowing you to choose one of three things to
punish you. I will do whichever one you choose.’ ”
13 So Gad went to David and told him what Yahweh had said. He said to David, “You
can choose whether there will be three years of famine in your land, or three months
of your army running away from your enemies, or three days when there will be a
◄plague/very severe illness► in your land. You think about it and choose which one
you want, and tell me, and I will return to Yahweh and tell him what your answer is.”
14 David said to Gad, “All those are very terrible things for me to choose between!
But allow Yahweh to punish [MTY] me, because he is very merciful. Do not allow
humans to punish me, because they will not be merciful.”
15 So Yahweh sent a plague on the Israeli people. It started that morning and did not
stop until the time that he had chosen/set. All over the land, from Dan to Beersheba,
there were 70,000 Israelis who died because of the plague.
16 When Yahweh’s angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy the
people by this plague, Yahweh changed his mind about punishing any more people.
He said to the angel who was killing them with the plague, “Stop what you are doing
[IDM]! That is enough!” When he said that, the angel was standing at the ground
where Araunah, from the Jebus people-group, threshed grain.
17 When David saw the angel who was causing the people to become sick and die,
he said to Yahweh, “Truly, I am the one who has committed the sin. I have done
a very wicked thing, but these people are as innocent as sheep [MET]. They have
certainly not [RHQ] done anything that is wrong. So you should punish [IDM] me and
my family, not these people!”
18 That day Gad came to David and said to him, “Go up to the place where Araunah
threshes grain, and build an altar to worship Yahweh there.”
19 So David did what Gad told him to do, which was what Yahweh had commanded,
and he went up there.
20 When Araunah looked down and saw the king and his officials coming toward
him, he prostrated himself on the ground in front of the king, with his face touching
the ground.
2 SAMUEL 24:21
479
2 SAMUEL 24:25
21 Araunah said, “Your Majesty, why have you come to me?” David replied, “I have
come to buy this ground where you thresh grain, in order to build an altar to Yahweh
and offer sacrifices on it, in order that he will stop the plague.”
22 Araunah replied to David, “Your Majesty, offer to Yahweh whatever you wish/
want. Here, take my oxen to use for the offering that will be completely burned on
the altar. And here, take their yokes and the boards that I use for the threshing, and
use them for the wood that you will burn.
23 I, Araunah, am giving all this to you, the king.” Then he said, “I desire/hope that
Yahweh our God will accept your offering.”
24 But the king said to Araunah, “No, I will not take these things as a gift. I will
pay you for it. I will not take sacrifices that have cost me nothing, and offer them
to Yahweh to be completely burned on the altar.” So he paid 50 pieces of silver to
Araunah for the oxen and the ground.
25 Then David built an altar to Yahweh, and he offered the oxen to be completely
burned on the altar, and he also offered sacrifices to maintain fellowship with
Yahweh. Then, Yahweh answered David’s prayers, and he caused the plague in Israel
to end.
1 KINGS 1:1
and of Israel being divided into two kingdoms, Israel and
1 Kings
When King David was an old man
1 When King David was very old [IDM, DOU], even though his servants put many
blankets on top of him, he was unable to become warm.
2 So they said to him, “Your Majesty, allow us to search for a young virgin who can
stay with you and take care of you. She can sleep close to you and enable you to
become warm.”
3 The king gave them permission, so they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful
young woman. They found a woman named Abishag, from Shunem town, and
brought her to the king.
4 She was truly very beautiful. She took care of [DOU] the king, but the king did not
have sexual relations with her.
Adonijah tried to become the king
5-6 After Absalom died, David’s oldest surviving son was Adonijah, whose mother
was Haggith. He was a very handsome/good-looking man. But David had never
rebuked him about anything he did. After Absalom died, Adonijah thought that he
would become king. So he started to boast, saying “I will become king now.” Then he
provided for himself some chariots, and men to drive them, and horses to pull them,
and 50 men to run as his bodyguards in front of those chariots wherever he went.
7 One day he conferred with Joab, David’s army commander, and Abiathar the priest,
and they promised/agreed to help/support Adonijah.
8 But Zadok, who was also a priest, Benaiah who had supervised David’s bodyguards,
Nathan the prophet, Shimei and Rei, and David’s most capable soldiers refused to
help/support Adonijah.
9 One day Adonijah went to Snake Rock near En-Rogel Spring, which is near
Jerusalem, to sacrifice some sheep and oxen and fattened cattle. He invited most
of his brothers, King David’s other sons, to come. He also invited all of the king’s
officials from Judah to come to the celebration.
10 But he did not invite Nathan or Benaiah or the king’s most capable soldiers or
his younger/half-brother Solomon.
11 Nathan found out what they were doing, so he went to Solomon’s mother
Bathsheba and asked her, “Have you not heard that Haggith’s son Adonijah is declared
himself to be the king? And King David does not know about it!
12 So if you want to save yourself and your son Solomon from being killed, allow
me to tell you what you should do.
13 Go immediately to King David. Say to him, ‘Your Majesty, you solemnly promised
me [RHQ] that my son Solomon would become the king after you die, and that he
would sit on your throne and rule. So why is it that Adonijah has said that he is now
the king?’
14 Then, while you are still talking to the king, I will come in and tell him that what
you are saying to him about Adonijah is true.”
1 KINGS 1:15
481
1 KINGS 1:34
15 So Bathsheba went to see the king in his bedroom. He was very old, and Abishag
was taking care of him.
16 Bathsheba bowed very low in front of the king, and the king asked her, “What
do you want?”
17 She replied, “Your Majesty, you solemnly promised me, knowing that Yahweh
our God was listening [IDM], that my son Solomon would become king after you die,
and that he would sit on your throne and rule.
18 But now, believe it or not, Adonijah has become king, and you do not know
anything about it.
19 He has sacrificed a lot of oxen and fattened cattle and sheep, and he has invited
all of your other sons to the celebration. He has also invited Abiathar the priest and
Joab the commander of your army, but he did not invite your son Solomon.
20 Your Majesty, all the people [SYN] of Israel are expecting you to tell them who is
the one who will become king after you are no longer the king.
21 If you do not do that, what will happen is that after you die [EUP] people will
consider that my son Solomon and I are rebelling, and they will execute us because
we did not help Adonijah to become king.”
22 While she was still talking to the king, Nathan came to the palace.
23 The king’s servants/advisors told David, “Nathan the prophet has come.” So
Bathsheba left, and Nathan went into where the king was and knelt down, with his
face on the ground.
24 Then Nathan said, “Your Majesty, have you declared that Adonijah will become
king after you are no longer the king?
25 I say that because today he has gone down to En-Rogel Spring and has sacrificed
a lot of oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep. And he has invited all of your other sons,
Joab the army commander, and Abiathar the priest. They are all eating and drinking
with him and saying ‘We hope/desire that King Adonijah will live a long time!’
26 But he did not invite me or Zadok the priest or Benaiah or Solomon.
27 Did you, as the king, say that they should do this without telling your other
officials who you want to become king [MTY] after you are no longer the king?”
28 Then after Nathan left the room, King David said to one of his servants, “Tell
Bathsheba to come in here again.” So he went and told her, and she came in and stood
29-30 Then the king said, “Yahweh has rescued me from all my troubles. I promised
would be king after I am no longer the king. Today, as surely as Yahweh lives, I
31 Bathsheba knelt down with her face on the ground and said, “Your Majesty, I
hope/desire that you will live for many more years [HYP]!”
32 Then King David said, “Summon Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and
Benaiah.” So someone went and summoned them. When they came in,
33 he said to them, “Put my son Solomon on my mule. Take him with my officials
down to Gihon Spring.
34 There, you two, Zadok and Nathan, should anoint him, with olive oil to appoint
him to be the king of Israel. Then you must blow trumpets, and all the people there
must shout, ‘We hope/desire that King Solomon will live for many years!’
1 KINGS 1:35
482
1 KINGS 1:52
35 Then follow him back here, and he will come and sit on my throne. He will then
become king instead of me. I have appointed him to be the ruler of all the people of
Israel and of Judah.”
36 Benaiah replied, “We will do that! We hope/wish that Yahweh, who is your God
and our God, will cause it to happen!
37 King David, Yahweh has helped you; we hope/wish that he will also help Solomon
and enable him to become a greater king than you have been.”
38 So Zadok, Nathan, Benaiah, and the two groups of men who were the king’s
bodyguards went and put Solomon on King David’s mule and escorted him down to
Gihon Spring.
39 There Zadok took the container of olive oil from the Sacred Tent and ◄anointed/
poured some oil on► Solomon. Then the trumpets were blown, and all the people
shouted, “We hope/wish that King Solomon will live for many years!”
40 Then all the people followed him back up to the city, shouting joyfully and playing
flutes. They shouted very loudly, with the result that the ground shook.
Adonijah’s reaction
41 When Adonijah and all ◄his guests/the people whom he had invited► were
finishing eating at their celebration, they heard the noise. When Joab heard the
sound of the trumpets, he asked, “What is causing all that noise in the city?”
42 While he was still speaking, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest, arrived.
Adonijah said, “Come in! You are a man whom we can trust, so you must be bringing
us good news!”
43 Jonathan replied, “No, I do not have good news! His Majesty, King David, has
caused Solomon to be the king!
44 He sent Zadok, Nathan, Benaiah, and his own group of bodyguards to go with
Solomon. They put Solomon on King David’s mule.
45 They went down to Gihon Spring, and there Zadok and Nathan anointed him to
become the king. Now they have returned from there to the city, shouting joyfully.
That is why there is that great/loud noise that you are hearing.
46 So Solomon is now our king [MTY].
47 Furthermore, the palace officials came to His Majesty, King David, to tell him
that they approved of what he had done. They said, ‘We wish/hope that our God will
enable Solomon [MTY] to become more famous than you have been and enable him
to be a better king than you have been.’ When they said that, the king, lying on his
bed, bowed his head to worship Yahweh.
48 Then he said, ‘I praise Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship, because he
has allowed one of my sons to become the king today, and has permitted me to see it
happen.’ ”
49 Then all of Adonijah’s guests ◄trembled/were afraid►, so they all immediately
got up and left and scattered.
50 Adonijah was afraid of what Solomon would do, so he went to the Sacred Tent
and grabbed the projections at the corners of the altar, because he knew that no one
would kill him there.
51 But someone told Solomon, “Hey/Listen, Adonijah is afraid of you, so he has gone
to the Sacred Tent and is holding on to the corners of the altar. He is saying, ‘Before I
leave, I want King Solomon to solemnly promise that he will not command that I be
executed.’ ”
52 Solomon replied, “If he proves that he is loyal to me, I will not harm him at all
[IDM]. But if he does anything that is wrong, he will be executed.”
1 KINGS 1:53
483
1 KINGS 2:15
53 So King Solomon sent some men to Adonijah, and they brought him back from
the altar. He came to Solomon and bowed down in front of him. Then Solomon said
to him, “Go home.”

David’s final instructions before he died
1 When David knew that he was about to die, he gave these final instructions to his
son Solomon:
2 “I am about to die [EUP], like everyone else on earth does. Be courageous and
conduct yourself as an adult should.
Obey all of his laws and commands and precepts and instructions that are written in
and wherever you go.
descendants do what I tell them to do, and faithfully obey my commands with all
their inner beings, they will always be [LIT] the ones who will rule [MTY] Israel.’
5 “There is something else that I want you to do. You know what Joab did to me. He
killed my two army commanders, Abner and Amasa. He murdered them violently
[MTY] during a time of peace, pretending that it was a time of war. Those two men
◄were innocent/had not done what was wrong►. But Joab killed them and caused
their blood to stain his belt and his sandals.
6 Because you are wise, do to him what you think is best for you to do, but do not
allow him to become old [MTY] and then die [IDM] peacefully.
7 “But be kind to the sons of Barzillai, the man from the Gilead region, and be sure
that they always have enough food to eat [MTY]. Do that because Barzillai helped me
when I was running away from your older brother Absalom.
8 Also, you remember Gera’s son Shimei from Bahurim town in the area where the
descendants of Benjamin live. You know what he did to me. He cursed me terribly on
the day I left Jerusalem and went to Mahanaim town. But when he later came down
to see me at the Jordan River, I solemnly promised, while Yahweh listened [MTY], that
I would not cause him to be executed.
9 But now you must [LIT] surely punish him. You are a wise man, so you will know
what you should do to him. He is an old man [MTY], but be sure that he loses/sheds
a lot of blood when you kill him [MTY].”
10 Then David died [EUP] and was buried in that part of Jerusalem which was called
‘The City of David’.
11 David had been the king of Israel for 40 years: He ruled for seven years in Hebron
and for 33 years in Jerusalem.
12 Solomon became the ruler/king [MTY] to take the place of his father David and
took control of all of the kingdom.
Solomon had Adonijah killed
13 One day Adonijah came to Solomon’s mother Bathsheba. She said to him, “Have
you come because you want things to go well?” He replied, “Yes.”
14 But then he said, “I have something to ask you to do.” She said, “Tell me what
you want me to do.”
15 He said, “You know that all the Israeli people expected me to be their king because
I am David’s oldest surviving son. But that did not happen. Instead, my younger
brother became king, because that is what Yahweh wanted.
1 KINGS 2:16
484
16 Now I have one thing that I ask you to do.
1 KINGS 2:32
Please do not refuse to do it.” She
17 He said, “Please ask King Solomon to give to me Abishag, the woman from
Shunem town, to be my wife. I am sure that he will not refuse.”
18 Bathsheba replied, “Okay, I will speak to the king for you.”
19 So Bathsheba went to King Solomon, to tell him what Adonijah wanted. The king
got up from his throne and went to greet her and bowed down to her. Then he sat on
his throne again and asked someone to bring a chair for her. So she sat down at the
king’s right side.
20 Then she said, “I have one small thing which I want you to do; please do not
say that you will not do it.” The king replied, “Mother, what do you want? I will not
refuse you.”
21 She said, “Allow Abishag to be given to your older brother Adonijah to be his
wife.”
22 The king replied angrily, “What? Are you requesting me to give Abishag to
Adonijah? Does he want me to allow him to rule the kingdom, too? Because he is my
older brother, does he think that he should be the king? Does he think that Abiathar
should be the priest instead of Zadok, and that Joab should be the army commander
instead of Benaiah because they supported him when he tried to become the king?”
23 Then Solomon solemnly promised, requesting Yahweh to listen, “I wish God
would strike me and kill me if I do not cause Adonijah to be executed for requesting
this!
24 Yahweh has appointed me to be the king and placed me here to rule [MTY] as
my father David did. He has promised that my descendants [MTY] will be the kings
of Israel. So just as surely as Yahweh lives, I solemnly promise that Adonijah will be
executed today!”
25 So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah to go and kill Adonijah, and Benaiah did
that.
26 Then Solomon said to Abiathar the priest, “Go to Anathoth town, to your land
there. You deserve to be killed, but I will not execute you now, because you were the
one who supervised the men who carried Yahweh’s Sacred Chest for David my father,
and you endured all the troubles that my father endured.”
27 So Solomon dismissed Abiathar from being the priest of Yahweh. By doing that
he caused to happen what Yahweh had said many years previously at Shiloh, that
some day he would get rid of the descendants [MTY] of Eli.
28 Joab had not supported Absalom when he tried to become the king, but he had
Tent, and he grasped the projections on the corners of the altar, because he knew that
29 When someone told Solomon that Joab had run to the Sacred Tent and was
standing alongside the altar, Solomon told Benaiah, “Go and execute Joab.”
30 So Benaiah went to the Sacred Tent and said to Joab, “The king commands you
to come out!” But Joab replied, “No, I will die here.” So Benaiah went back to the
king and reported what he had said to Joab, and what Joab had replied.
31 The king replied to him, “Do what he has requested. Kill him and bury his body.
If you do that, my descendants [MTY] and I will no longer be punished for what Joab
did when he killed [MTY] two men who ◄were innocent/had not done anything that
is wrong►.
32 But Yahweh will punish [MTY] Joab for attacking and killing Abner, the
commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa, the commander of the army of Judah,
1 KINGS 2:33
485
1 KINGS 3:3
two men who were more righteous and better [DOU] men than he is. My father David
did not even know that Joab was planning to murder them.
33 Joab and his descendants will be punished [IDM] forever for his murdering Abner
and Amasa. But things will forever go well for David’s descendants [MTY] who rule
[MTY] as King David did.”
34 So Benaiah went into the Sacred Tent and killed Joab. Joab was buried on his
property in the desert part of Judah.
35 Then the king appointed Benaiah to be the commander of the army instead of
Joab, and he appointed Zadok to be the priest instead of Abiathar.
36 Then the king sent a messenger to summon Shimei, and the king said to him,
“Build a house for yourself here in Jerusalem. Remain there and do not leave the city
to go anywhere.
37 Be sure that the day that you leave Jerusalem and go across the Kidron Brook,
you will be executed, and it will be ◄your own fault/what you deserve►.”
38 Shimei replied, “Your Majesty, what you say is good. I will do what you have
said.” So Shimei remained in Jerusalem for several years.
39 But three years later, two of Shimei’s slaves ran away. They went to stay with
Maacah’s son Achish, the king of Gath city. When someone told Shimei that they were
in Gath,
40 he put a saddle on his donkey and got on it and went to Gath. He found his slaves
staying with King Achish and brought them back home.
41 But someone told King Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath
and had returned.
42 So the king sent a soldier to summon Shimei and said to him, “I told you to
solemnly promise, knowing that Yahweh [MTY] was listening, that you must not leave
Jerusalem. I told you [RHQ], ‘Be sure that if you ever leave Jerusalem, you will be
executed.’ And you replied [RHQ] to me, ‘What you have said is good; I will do what
you have said.’
43 So why did you not do what you solemnly promised to Yahweh? Why did you
disobey what I commanded you?”
44 The king also said to Shimei, “You know all the evil things that you did to my
father David. So Yahweh will now punish you for the evil things that you did.
forever.”
So Solomon was completely in control of the kingdom.
3
1 Solomon went to see the king of Egypt. Solomon made an agreement with him to
marry his daughter. They also made an alliance/agreement that their armies would
not attack each other. Then Solomon brought the king’s daughter to live in the part
of Jerusalem called ‘The City of David’. She lived there until Solomon’s workers had
finished building his house and the temple of Yahweh and the wall around Jerusalem.
2 At that time the temple of Yahweh had not yet been built, so the Israeli people
were still offering sacrifices at many other places of worship.
3 Solomon loved Yahweh, and he obeyed all the instructions that his father David
had given him. But he also offered sacrifices and burned incense at various altars.
1 KINGS 3:4
486
1 KINGS 3:20
4 One day the king went to Gibeon city to offer a sacrifice there,
because that
was where the most famous/important altar was. In previous years he had offered
hundreds of sacrifices on that altar.
5 That night, Yahweh appeared to him in a dream. He asked Solomon, “What would
you like me to give to you?”
6 Solomon replied, “You always greatly and faithfully loved my father David, who
served you well. You did that because he ◄was faithful to/faithfully obeyed► you and
acted righteously and honestly toward you. And you have showed how greatly and
faithfully you loved him by giving to him me, his son, and now I am ruling [MTY] as
he did before he died.
7 “Now, Yahweh my God, you have appointed me to be the king like my father was.
But I am very young, like a little child [MET]. I do not know how to lead/rule my people
at all [IDM].
8 I am here among the people whom you have chosen. They are a very large group
of people; there are very, very many of them, with the result that no one can count
them [DOU].
9 So please enable me to think clearly, in order that I may rule your people well.
Enable me to know what is good and what is evil. If you do not do that, I will never
[RHQ] be able to rule this great group of people who belong to you.”
10 Yahweh was very pleased that Solomon had requested that.
11 God said to him, “You did not request that you live for many years or that you
become very rich or that you be able to kill all your enemies. Instead, you have
requested that I enable you to be wise, in order that you will be able to know and to
do what is right while you govern these people.
12 So, I will certainly do what you requested. I will enable you to be very wise
[DOU]. The result will be that no one who has lived before you or who will live after
you will be as wise as you are.
13 I will also give you things that you did not request: I will enable you to become
very rich and honored, as long as you live. You will be richer and more honored than
any other king.
commandments, as your father David did, I will enable you to live for many years.”
Then he went to Jerusalem and stood in front of the Sacred Tent where the Sacred
and offerings to maintain fellowship with Yahweh. Then he made a feast for all his
Solomon made a very wise decision concerning two women
17 One of them said, “Your Majesty, this woman and I live in the same house. I gave
birth to a baby while she was there in the house.
18 Three days after my baby was born, this woman also gave birth to a baby. Only
the two of us were in the house; there was no one else there.
19 “But one night this woman’s baby died because she accidentally rolled on top of
her baby while sleeping and smothered it.
20 So she got up at midnight and took my baby boy who was lying beside me while
I was sleeping. She carried him to her bed and brought her dead baby and put it in
my bed.
1 KINGS 3:21
487
1 KINGS 4:10
21 When I awoke the next morning and was ready to nurse my baby, I saw that it
was dead. But when I looked at it closely in the morning light, I saw that it was not
my baby!”
22 But the other woman said, “That is not true! The baby that is alive is mine, and
the baby that is dead is yours!” Then the first woman said, “No, the dead baby is
yours, and the one that is alive is mine!” And they continued to argue in front of the
king.
23 Then the king said, “Both of you are saying, ‘My baby is the one that is alive and
the one that is dead is yours.’ ”
24 So he said to one of his servants, “Bring me a sword.” So the servant brought a
sword to the king.
25 Then the king said to the servant, “Cut the baby that is alive into two parts. Give
one part to each of the women.”
26 But the woman whose baby was alive loved her baby very much, so she said to
the king, “No, Your Majesty! Do not allow him to kill the baby! Give her the child
that is alive!” But the other woman said to the king, “No, cut it in half. Then it will
not be her baby or my baby.”
27 Then the king said to the servant, “Do not kill the baby. Give the baby to the
woman who said ‘Do not cut the baby in half,’ because she is truly the baby’s mother.”
28 All the Israeli people heard about what the king had decided, and they revered
him. They realized that God had truly enabled him to be very wise, to judge people’s
matters fairly.

Solomon’s governors and officials
1 Solomon was the king who ruled all of Israel,
2 and these were his most important officials:
Zadok’s son Azariah was the priest.
3 Shisha’s sons Elihoreph and Ahijah were the official secretaries.
Ahilud’s son Jehoshaphat was the one who announced to the people the king’s
decisions.
4 Benaiah was the commander of the army.
Zadok and Abiathar were also priests.
5 Nathan’s son Azariah was the administrator of the governors.
Another of Nathan’s sons, Zabud, was a priest and the king’s chief advisor.
6 Ahishar supervised the servants who worked in the palace.
Abda’s son Adoniram supervised the men who were forced to do work for the
government.
7 Solomon appointed twelve men, one to govern each of the regions
in Israel. They
also were required to provide food for the king and all the others who lived and
worked in the palace. Each man was required to provide from his own region the
food for one month each year.
8 Their names were:
Ben-Hur, for the hilly area of the tribe of Ephraim.
9 Ben-Deker, for Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-Shemesh, and Elon-Bethhanan cities;
10 Ben-Hesed, for Arubboth and Socoh towns and the area near Hepher town;

district;
12 Ahilud’s son Baana, for Taanach and Megiddo towns, and all the region near
Zarethan city, and from Beth-Shan city south of Jezreel as far as Abel-Meholah
town and Jokmeam city;
13 Ben-Geber, for Ramoth city in the Gilead region, and for the villages in Gilead
that belonged to Jair, who was a descendant of Manasseh, and the Argob area
in the Bashan region. There were 60 large towns in that region altogether, each
town with a wall around it and bronze bars across the gates.
14 Iddo’s son Ahinadab, for Mahanaim city east of the Jordan River;
15 Ahimaaz, who had married Solomon’s daughter Basemath, for the territory of
the tribe of Naphtali;
16 Hushai’s son Baana, for the territory of the tribe of Asher and for Aloth town;
17 Paruah’s son Jehoshaphat, for the territory of the tribe of Issachar;
18 Ela’s son Shimei, for the territory of the tribe of Benjamin;
19 Uri’s son Geber, for the Gilead region, the land that Sihon the king of the Amor
people-group formerly ruled, and the Bashan area, which was the area that Og
In addition to all those, Solomon appointed one governor for the territory of the
Solomon’s kingdom
20 There were as many people in Judah and Israel as there are grains of sand [HYP]
on the seashore. They had plenty to eat and drink and they were happy.
21 Solomon’s kingdom extended from the Euphrates River in the northeast to the
Philistia area in the west and to the border of Egypt in the south. The conquered
people in those areas paid taxes and were under Solomon’s control for the rest of his
life.
22 To feed the people in his palace and his guests Solomon needed people to bring to
him every day 150 bushels of fine flour and 300 bushels of wheat,
23 ten cattle that were kept in stalls/barns, 20 cattle that were kept in pastures, 100
sheep, and ◄deer and gazelles and roebucks/three kinds of deer►, and poultry.
24 Solomon ruled over all the area west of the Euphrates River, from Tiphsah city
in the northeast to Gaza city in the southwest. He ruled over all the kings in that
area. And there was peace between his government and the governments of nearby
countries.
25 All during the years that Solomon ruled, the people of Judah and Israel lived
safely. Each family had its own grapevines and fig trees.
26 Solomon had 4,000 stalls for the horses that pulled his chariots and 12,000 men
who rode on horses (OR, in the chariots).
27 His twelve governors supplied the food that King Solomon needed for himself
and for all those who ate in the palace. Each governor supplied food for one month
each year. They provided everything [LIT] that Solomon required.
28 They also brought stalks of barley and wheat for the fast horses that pulled the
chariots and for the other work horses. They brought it to the places where the horses
were kept.
Solomon’s wisdom
God enabled Solomon to be extremely wise and to have great insight/
understanding. He understood about more things than the number of grains of sand
29
1 KINGS 4:30
489
1 KINGS 5:13
30 He was wiser than all the wise men in Arabia and Mesopotamia and all the wise
men in Egypt.
31 Ethan from Ezrah and Heman and Calcol and Darda and the sons of Mahol were
considered to be very wise, but Solomon was wiser than all of them. People in all the
nearby countries heard about Solomon.
32 He composed/wrote 3,000 ◄proverbs/wise sayings► and more than 1,000 songs.
33 He talked about various kinds of plants, from the huge cedar trees in Lebanon to
the tiny hyssop plants that grow in cracks in walls. He also talked about wild animals
and birds and reptiles and fish.
34 People came from all over the world to hear the wise things that Solomon said.
Many kings sent men to listen to him and then return and tell them what Solomon
said.

Preparations for building the temple
1 Hiram, the king of Tyre city, had always been a close friend of King David. When
he heard that Solomon had been appointed to become the king after his father was
no longer king, he sent some messengers to Solomon to congratulate him.
2 Solomon gave those messengers this message to take back to Hiram:
3 “You know that my father David led his soldiers to fight many wars against his
enemies in the nearby countries. So he could not arrange to build a temple in which
we [MTY] could worship Yahweh our God, until after Yahweh enabled the Israeli
army to defeat [IDM] all his enemies.
4 But now Yahweh our God has enabled us to have peace with all the surrounding
countries. ◄There is no danger that/We do not need to worry that► we will be attacked.
5 Yahweh promised my father David, ‘Your son, whom I will enable to be king
after you are no longer king, will build a temple for me [MTY].’ Because of that, I
have decided to build a temple in which we can worship [MTY] Yahweh our God.
6 “So I am requesting that you command your workers to cut cedar trees for me.
My men will work with them, and I will pay your workers whatever you decide.
But my men cannot do the work alone, because they do not know how to cut down
trees like your workers from Sidon city do.”
7 When Hiram heard the message from Solomon, he was very happy and said, “I
praise Yahweh today for giving David a very wise son to rule that great nation!”
8 He sent this message back to Solomon: “I have heard the message that you sent
to me, and I am ready to do what you ask. I will provide cedar and cypress logs.
9 My workers will bring the logs down from the Lebanon mountains to the
Mediterranean sea. Then they will tie them together to make rafts to float them in
the water along the coast to the place that you indicate. Then my workers will untie
the logs, and your workers will take them from there. What I want you to do is to
supply food for the people who work in my palace.”
10 So Hiram arranged for his workers to supply all the cedar and cypress logs that
11 Each year Solomon gave Hiram 100,000 bushels of wheat and 110,000 gallons of
12 Yahweh enabled Solomon to be wise, just like he had promised.
Solomon
and Hiram made a treaty/agreement that there would be peace between their two
governments/countries.
13 King Solomon forced 30,000 men from all over Israel to become his workers.
1 KINGS 5:14
490
1 KINGS 6:15
14 Adoniram was their boss.
Solomon divided the men into three groups. Each
month 10,000 of them went to Lebanon and worked for a month there, and then they
came back home for two months.
15 Solomon also forced 80,000 men to cut stones in the hilly area and 70,000 men
to haul the stones to Jerusalem.
16 And he also assigned 3,600 men to supervise their work.
17 The king also commanded his workers to cut huge blocks of stones from the
quarries and to smooth the sides of the stones. Those huge stones were for the
18 Solomon’s workers and Hiram’s workers and men from Gebal/Byblos city shaped
Solomon’s men built the temple
6
1 480 years after the Israeli people left Egypt, during the fourth year that Solomon
ruled Israel, early in May, Solomon’s workers began to build the temple.
2 Inside, the main part of the temple was 90 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 45 feet high.
3 The entrance room was 15 feet long and 30 feet wide, just as wide as the main
part of the temple.
4 There were windows in the walls of the temple. The windows were narrower on
the outside than on the inside.
5 Against the two sides and against the back of the temple walls, they built a
structure/building that had rooms in it. This structure had three levels/stories and
each was 7-1/2 feet high.
6 Each room in the lowest level/story was 7-1/2 feet wide. Each room in the middle
level/story was nine feet wide. The rooms in the top level/story were 10-1/2 feet wide.
The wall of the temple at the top level/story was thinner than the wall at the middle
level/story, and the wall of the middle level/story was thinner than the wall at the
bottom level/story. The result was that the rooms could be supported by the wall
underneath them, and did not require wooden beams to support them.
7 The huge stones for the foundation of the temple were cut and shaped at the
quarry to become very smooth. The result was that while the workers were building
the temple there was no noise, because they did not use hammers or chisels or any
other iron tools there.
8 The entrance to the bottom level/story of that attached structure was on the south
side of the temple. There were stairs from the bottom level/story to the middle and
9 So Solomon’s workers finished building the framework of the temple. They made
10 They built the structure that had three levels/stories, that was against the walls
cedar beams.
11 Then Yahweh said this to Solomon:
obey all my statutes and laws and commands, I will do for you what I promised to

them from the floor to the ceiling. They made the floor from cypress boards.
1 KINGS 6:16
491
1 KINGS 7:1
16 Inside the back part of the temple they built an inner room, called the Very Holy
Place. It was 30 feet long. All the walls of this room were lined with cedar boards.
17 In front of the Very Holy Place there was a room that was 60 feet long.
18 The cedar boards on the walls inside the temple were decorated with carvings of
gourds and flowers. The walls were completely covered with cedar boards, with the
result that the stones of the walls behind them could not be seen.
19 At the back of the temple they made the Very Holy Place, where the Sacred Chest
would be put.
20 That room was 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 30 feet high. They covered the
walls with very thin sheets of pure gold. For burning incense they also made an altar
of cedar boards.
21 Solomon told them to cover the other walls inside the temple with very thin sheets
of pure gold and to fasten gold chains across the entrance to the Very Holy Place.
22 They covered all the walls of the temple and the altar that was outside the Very
Holy Place with very thin sheets of gold.
23 Inside the Very Holy Place, they made from olive tree wood large statues of two
creatures with wings. Each one was 15 feet tall.
24-26 They each were the same size and had the same shape. They each had two
wings which were spread out. Each wing was 7-1/2 feet long, with the result that the
distance between the outer ends of the two wings was 15 feet.
27 They put those statues next to each other in the Very Holy Place so that the wing
of the one touched the one wing of the other in the center of the room, and the outer
wings touched the walls.
28 They covered the statues with very thin sheets of gold.
29 Solomon told them to decorate the walls of the main room and the Very Holy
Place by carving representations of winged creatures and palm trees and flowers.
30 They also covered the floor of both rooms with very thin sheets of gold.
31 They made a set of doors from olive tree wood, and placed them at the entrance
to the Very Holy Place. The doorposts joined at the top to form a pointed arch.
32 The doors were decorated by carving on them representations of winged
creatures, palm trees, and flowers. All of these things were covered with very thin
sheets of gold.
33 They made a rectangular door frame from olive tree wood, and put it between
the entrance room and the main room.
34 They made two folding doors from cypress wood and fastened them to the door
35 The doors were also decorated with wood carvings of winged creatures, palm
36 They built a courtyard in front of the temple. The walls around the courtyard
they put down two layers of stone.
37 They laid the foundation of the temple of Yahweh in early May, in the fourth year
that Solomon ruled.
38 In the eleventh year that he ruled, in the middle of October, they finished building
the temple and all of its parts, doing exactly what Solomon told them to do. It required
seven years to build it.
7
They built a palace for Solomon
1 They also built a palace for Solomon, but it required 13 years to build it.
1 KINGS 7:2
492
1 KINGS 7:22
2 One of the buildings they constructed was a large ceremonial hall.
It was called
the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon. It was 150 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high.
It was supported/held up by four rows of pillars of wood from cedar trees. There were
15 pillars in each row. There were cedar beams across each row.
3 To support the roof there were cedar beams that connected the rows of pillars.
4 On each of the two side walls there were three rows of windows.
5 All the windows and doorways had rectangular frames. The windows along the
long wall on one side faced the windows on the other side.
6 They also built another building called the Hall of Pillars. It was 75 feet long and
45 feet wide. It had a covered porch whose roof was supported by pillars.
7 Then they made a building called the Hall of the Throne. It was also called the Hall
of Judgment. That was where Solomon decided/judged concerning people’s disputes.
The walls were covered with cedar boards, from the floor to the rafters.
8 In the courtyard behind the Hall of Judgment they built a house for Solomon to
live in that was made like the other buildings. They also built the same kind of house
for his wife, who was the daughter of the king of Egypt.
9 All of those buildings and the walls around the palace courtyard were made from
costly blocks of stone, from the foundations up to the eaves. The stones were cut at
the quarry, according to the sizes that were needed, and the sides of the stones were
shaped by cutting/smoothing them with saws.
10 The foundations were also made from huge blocks of stone that were prepared
at the quarry. Some of them were twelve feet long and some were fifteen feet long.
11 On top of the foundation stones were other blocks of stone that were cut
according to the sizes they needed, and cedar beams.
12 The palace courtyard, the inner courtyard in front of the temple, and the entrance
room of the temple had walls made by putting down three layers of cut stones
between each layer of cedar beams.
Other things for the temple area
13-14 There was a man who lived in Tyre city whose name was Huram.
He knew
how to make very nice things from bronze. His father had also lived in Tyre and
had also been very skilled at making things from bronze, but Huram’s father was no
longer living. His mother was from the tribe of Naphtali. Huram was very wise and
intelligent and was very skilled at making things from bronze. Solomon invited him
to come to Jerusalem and supervise all the work of making things from bronze, and
Huram agreed.
15 He made two bronze pillars. Each one was 27 feet tall and 18 feet around. Each
was hollow, and the walls of the pillars were 3 in./7.4 cm. thick.
16 He also made two bronze caps to be put on top of the pillars. Each cap was 7-1/2
feet tall.
17 Then he made bronze wreaths of chains to decorate the top part of each pillar.
18 He also made bronze figures that resembled pomegranates. He put two rows of
19 The top part over each pillar was shaped like a lily. Each lily leaf was six feet tall.
20 These top parts were placed on a bowl-shaped section around which was draped
the wreaths of chains. He made 200 figures that represented pomegranates and put
them in two rows around the top/head of each pillar.
21 His helpers set up the pillars in front of the entrance of the temple. The pillar on
the south side was named Jakin, and the pillar on the north side was named Boaz.
22 The bronze top parts that were shaped like lilies were placed on top of the pillars.
So Huram and his helpers finished making the bronze pillars.
1 KINGS 7:23
493
1 KINGS 7:41
23 Huram also constructed a very large round bronze tank that was made of metal
and cast in a clay mold. It was 7-1/2 ft./2.3 meters high, 30 feet/9 meters across/wide,
and 45 feet/13.5 meters around it.
24 Around the outer edge of the rim of the tank were two rows of gourds that were
made of bronze. But the gourds were not cast separately; they were cast in the same
mold as the rest of the tank. For each foot of length around the rim of the tank there
were six figures of gourds.
25 Huram also cast twelve bronze statues of oxen. He placed them to face outward.
He placed three of them to face north, three to face west, three to face south, and
three to face east. His helpers put the bronze tank on the backs of the statues of the
oxen.
26 The sides of the tank were 3 in./8 cm. thick. The rim was like the rim of a cup. It
curved outward, like the petals of a lily. When the tank was full, it held about 10,000
gallons of water.
27 Huram also made ten bronze carts. Each was six feet long and six feet wide and
4-1/2 feet tall.
28 On the sides of the carts there were panels which were set in frames.
29 On those panels were bronze figures of lions, bulls, and winged creatures. Below
and above the lions and bulls there were decorations of bronze wreaths.
30 Each cart had four bronze wheels and two axles made of bronze. At the top
corners of each cart were bronze supports to hold up a basin. On these supports
31 On top of each cart, under each basin, was a frame that resembled a circular collar.
of it was nine inches below the top of the cart. There were also decorations of bronze
32 The wheels were 27 inches high. They were below the panels. The wheels were
connected to axles that had been cast in the same mold as the rest of the cart.
33 The wheels of the carts were like the wheels of chariots. The axles, the rims, the
spokes, and the hubs were all cast from bronze.
34 At the top corners of each cart there were handles. These were cast in the same
mold as the rest of the cart.
35 There was a nine-inch bronze band around the top of each cart. There were
braces attached to the corners of each cart. The bands and the braces were cast in
the same mold as the rest of the cart.
36 The braces and the panels on the sides of the carts were also decorated with figures
of winged creatures, lions, and palm trees, whenever there was space for them, and
there were bronze wreaths all around them.
37 That is how Huram made the ten carts. They were all cast in the same mold, so
they were all alike: They all were the same size and had the same shape.
38 Huram also made ten bronze basins, one for each cart. Each basin was six feet
across and held 200 gallons of water.
39 Huram placed five of the carts on the south side of the temple and five on the
north side. He put the big tank at the southeast corner.
40 Huram also made pots, shovels for carrying ashes, and bowls for carrying the
blood of the animals that would be sacrificed. He completed all the work that King
Solomon requested him to do for the temple. This is a list of the bronze things he
made:
41 the two pillars;
the two top parts to be put over the pillars;
the two wreaths of chains to decorate the tops of the pillars;
1 KINGS 7:42
494
1 KINGS 8:6
42 the 400 figures of pomegranates, in two rows, with 100 in each row, that were
placed over the top parts of the pillars;
43 the ten carts;
the ten basins;
44 the big tank;
the twelve statues of oxen on whose backs the tank was placed;
45 the pots, shovels for the ashes of the altar, and bowls.
Huram and his workers made all these things for King Solomon and put them
outside the temple. They were all made of polished bronze.
46 They made them by pouring melted bronze into the clay molds that Huram had
set up near the Jordan River Valley, between the cities of Succoth and Zarethan.
47 Solomon did not tell his workers to weigh those bronze objects, because there
were many items. So no one ever knew what they weighed.
48 Solomon’s workers also made all the gold items for the temple:
the altar;
the table on which the priests put the sacred bread placed before God;
side and five on the north side;
the lamps;
50 the cups, the gold lamp wick snuffers, the small lamp bowls, the dishes for
entrance to the Very Holy Place and for the doors at the entrance to the main
room of the temple.
Those things were all made of gold.
51 So Solomon’s workers finished all the work for the temple. Then they placed in
the temple storerooms all the things that his father David had dedicated to Yahweh—
all the silver and gold, and the other valuable items.
8
The sacred chest was brought to the temple
1 Solomon then summoned to Jerusalem all the elders of Israel, all the leaders of
the tribes, and the leaders of the clans. He wanted them to join in bringing Yahweh’s
Sacred Chest from Zion Hill to the temple, where it was in the part of the city called
‘The City of David’.
2 So all the Israeli leaders came to King Solomon during the Festival of Living in
Temporary Shelters, in October.
3 When they had all arrived, the priests lifted up the Sacred Chest
4 and brought it to the temple. The descendants of Levi who assisted the priests
helped them to carry to the temple the Sacred Tent and all the sacred things that had
been in the tent.
5 Then King Solomon and many of the Israeli people who had gathered in front of
Yahweh’s Sacred Chest sacrificed a huge amount of sheep and oxen. No one was able
to count the sacrifices because there were so many.
6 The the priests then brought the Sacred Chest into the Very Holy Place in the
temple, and they placed it under the wings of the statues of the winged creatures.
1 KINGS 8:7
495
1 KINGS 8:25
7 The wings of those statues spread out over the Sacred Chest and over the poles
8 The poles were so long that the ends of the poles could be seen by people who
were standing at the entrance to the Most Holy Place, but they could not be seen by
people standing outside the temple. Those poles are still there.
9 The only things that were in the Sacred Chest were the two stone tablets that
Moses had put there at Sinai Mountain, where Yahweh made an agreement with the
people after they left Egypt.
10 When the priests came out of the temple, suddenly it was filled with a cloud.
11 It was the glory/radiance of Yahweh that filled the temple, with the result that
the priests were not able to continue their work.
12 Then Solomon prayed this:
“Yahweh, you have placed the sun in the sky,
but you have decided that you would live in very dark clouds.
13 I have built for you a magnificent temple,
14 Then, while all the people stood there, the king turned around and faced them,
15 He said, “Praise Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis belong! By his own power
this:
16 ‘From the time that I brought my people out of Egypt, I have never chosen any
city in Israel in which a temple should be built for my people to worship me there.
But I chose you, David, to rule my people.”
17 Then Solomon said, “My father David wanted to build a temple in order that we
Israeli people could worship Yahweh our God there.
18 But Yahweh said to him, ‘You have wanted to build a temple for me, and what
you wanted to do was good.
19 However, you are not the one who I want to build it. It is one of your sons, who
I want to build a temple for me.’
20 And now Yahweh has done what he promised to do. I have become the king of
Israel to succeed my father, and I am ruling my people, like Yahweh promised. I have
arranged for this temple to be built for us Israelis to worship Yahweh, the God, to
whom we Israelis belong.
21 I have also provided a place in the temple for the Sacred Chest in which are the
two stone tablets on which are engraved the Ten Commandments of the agreement that
Yahweh made with our ancestors when he brought them out of Egypt.”
Solomon’s prayer
22 Then Solomon stood in front of the altar which was facing the Israeli people who
had gathered there. He spread out his arms toward heaven,
23 and he prayed,
“Yahweh, the God whom we Israeli people belong to/worship, there is no god like
you up in heaven or down here on the earth. You solemnly promised that you
would faithfully love us. And that is what you have done for us who earnestly do
what you want us to do.
24 You have done the things that you promised my father David, who served you
very well, that you would do. Truly, you promised to do these things for him, and
today we see that by your power you have done them.
25 So now, Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis belong to/worship, please do the
things that you promised my father that you would do. You told him that there
1 KINGS 8:26
496
1 KINGS 8:41-42
would always be some of his descendants who would rule Israel, if they would
conduct their lives as he did.
26 So now, God of us Israeli people, cause what you promised to do for my father
David, who served you well, to happen.
27 But God, you cannot really live on the earth. There is surely not enough space
for you in the sky, or even in the heaven. So there is surely not enough space for
you to live in this temple that my workers have built.
28 But Yahweh, my God, please listen to me while I am praying to you this day,
29 Please keep protecting this temple night and day. This is the place about which
you have said, ‘I will always be there.’ I request that you listen to me whenever I
turn toward this temple and pray.
30 I request that when I pray to you and your people pray to you while they turn
toward this place, that in your home in heaven you will hear us and forgive us for
31 If someone is accused of doing something wrong to another person, and they
may God punish me if I am not telling the truth,’
the person who is guilty as he deserves to be punished, and declare that the other
person is innocent.
33 And when your Israeli people are defeated by their enemies in a battle because
they have sinned against you, and if they are forced to go to some distant country, if
they turn away from their sinful behavior and turn toward this temple and admit
that you have justly punished them, and if they plead that you will forgive them,
34 listen to them from heaven, and forgive your Israeli people for the sins that
they have committed, and bring them back to this land that you gave to our ancestors.
35 And when you do not allow any rain to fall on the land because your people
justly punished them, if they turn away from their sinful behavior and humbly pray
36 listen to them from heaven, and forgive your Israeli people for the sins that
they have committed. Teach them the right way to conduct their lives. Then send rain
on this land that you have given to your people to belong to them permanently.
37 And when the people of this land experience famines, or if there is a plague/
illness that causes many people to become sick, or if their crops are destroyed by
very hot winds or by mildew or by locusts or grasshoppers, or when their enemies
surround any of their cities in order to attack them, if any of those bad things
happen to them,
38 when your Israeli people earnestly plead with you knowing that they are
suffering because they have sinned, and if they stretch out their arms toward this
temple and pray,
39 listen to them from your home in heaven, and forgive them, and help them.
You are the only one who knows what people are thinking, so act toward everyone
as they deserve,
40 in order that your people may then have an awesome respect for you, all the
years that they live in this land that you gave to our ancestors.
41-42 There will be some foreigners who do not belong to your Israeli people who
have come here from countries far away because they have heard that you are
very great and that you perform great miracles. If they come here to this temple
to worship you and pray,
1 KINGS 8:43
497
1 KINGS 8:61
43 in your home in heaven, listen to their prayers, and do for them what they
request you to do. Do that so that all the people-groups in the world will know about
you and revere you, like we your Israeli people do. And then they will know that this
temple that I have caused to be built to honor you, is where you should be worshiped.
44 And if you send your people to go to fight against their enemies, if they pray
to you, wherever they are, if they turn toward this city that you have chosen and
toward this temple that I have caused to be built for you,
45 listen in heaven to their prayers; listen to what they plead for you to do, and
assist them.
46 It is true that everyone sins. So, if your people sin against you, and you become
angry with them, you may allow their enemies to defeat them and capture them
and take them away to their enemies’ country, even to countries that are far away.
47 If that happens, while they are in those countries to which they were forced

ancestors, and toward this city that you have chosen to be the place where we should
pray,
49 then from your home in heaven listen to them while they plead for your help,
and assist them.
50 Forgive them for all the sins that they have committed against you, and cause
their enemies to be kind to them.
51 Do not forget that the Israelis are your people; they are your special possession;
you brought our ancestors out of Egypt where they were greatly suffering as though
they were in a blazing furnace.
52 I request that you always listen to your Israeli people and to me, their king,
and heed their prayers whenever they call out to you to help them.
53 You chose them from all the other people-groups in the world to belong to you,
which is what you told Moses to tell them when you brought our ancestors out of
Egypt.”
54 After Solomon had finished praying and pleading to Yahweh for his help, he stood
up in front of the altar where he had been kneeling. He lifted up his arms.
55 Then he asked God to bless all the Israeli people. He prayed loudly, saying,
56 “Praise Yahweh, who has given us his people peace, like he promised that he
would do. He has done every one of the good things that he promised to Moses,
the man who served him very well.
57 I pray that our God will be with us like he was with our ancestors, and that he
will never abandon us.
58 I pray that he will cause us to loyally serve him, to conduct our lives as he
wants us to, and to obey all his commandments and statutes and laws that he gave
to our ancestors.
59 I pray that Yahweh our God will never forget these words that I have prayed,
pleading for his help; I pray that he will think about them by day and by night. I pray
that he will always help us Israeli people and me, giving us the things that we need
day by day.
60 If he does that, all the people-groups in the world will know that he is the only
one who is God, and that there is no other one who is God.
61 I pray that you, his people, will always be fully committed to Yahweh, and that
you will obey all his statutes and commands, like you are doing now.”

Solomon dedicated the temple
62 Then the king and all the Israeli people who were there offered sacrifices to
Yahweh.
63 They sacrificed 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep to maintain fellowship with
Yahweh. Then the king and all the people dedicated the temple.
64 On that day, the king also dedicated/set apart the middle part of the courtyard
that was in front of the temple. Then he offered sacrifices that would be completely
burned in the courtyard, the offerings of grain and the fat of the animals that were
sacrificed to maintain fellowship with Yahweh. They sacrificed them there because
the bronze altar was not big enough for all those sacrifices to be burned on it that
day.
65 Then Solomon and all the Israeli people celebrated the Festival of Living in
whom had come from distant places like Hamath in the far north and the border of
66 On the eighth day, Solomon sent the people to their homes. They all praised him
David and his Israeli people.

Yahweh’s reply to Solomon’s prayer
1 After Solomon’s workers had finished building the temple and his palace and
everything else that Solomon wanted them to build,
2 Yahweh appeared to him in a dream a second time, like he had appeared to him
at the city of Gibeon.
3 Yahweh said to him,
“I heard what you prayed and what you pleaded for me to do. I have set apart/
dedicated this temple which your workers have built to be the place where people
will worship me forever. I will always watch over it and protect it.
4 “And as for you, if you conduct your life as I want you to, like your father David
did, and if you very sincerely obey all the statutes and laws that I have commanded
you to obey,
5 I will do what I promised your father that I would do: I promised him that Israel
would always be ruled by his descendants.
6 “But if you or your descendants turn away from me and disobey the commands
and decrees that I have given to you, and if you start to worship other gods,
7 I will remove my Israeli people from the land that I have given to them. I will
also abandon this temple that I have set apart/dedicated to be the place where people
should worship me. Then people everywhere will despise the people of Israel and
make fun of them.
8 This temple will become a heap of ruins. Everyone who passes by will be
astonished when they see it, and they will be shocked and say, ‘Why has Yahweh
done this to this land and to this temple?’
9 And other people will reply, ‘It happened because the Israeli people abandoned
Yahweh their God, the one who brought their ancestors out of Egypt. They started
to accept and worship other gods. And that is why Yahweh has caused them to
experience all these disasters.’ ”
Other things that Solomon did
10 Solomon’s workers labored for 20 years to build the temple and the palace.
1 KINGS 9:11
499
1 KINGS 9:28
11 Hiram, the king of Tyre had arranged for his workers to give Solomon all the
cedar and pine logs and all the gold that he needed for this work. After it was all
finished, King Solomon gave to Hiram 20 cities in the Galilee region.
12 But when Hiram went from Tyre to Galilee to see the cities that Solomon had
given to him, he was not pleased with them.
13 He said to Solomon, “My friend, those cities that you gave me are worthless!” So,
that area is still called ‘Worthless’.
14 Hiram paid Solomon only five tons of gold for those cities.
15 This is a record of the work that King Solomon forced men to do. He forced them
city, and the wall around Jerusalem, and to rebuild the cities of Hazor and Megiddo
16 The reason they needed to rebuild Gezer was that the army of the king of Egypt
killed all the people of the Canaan people-group who lived there. The king of Egypt
gave that city to his daughter as a gift when she married Solomon.
17 So Solomon’s workers also rebuilt Gezer, and they also rebuilt Lower Beth-Horon
city.
18 They also rebuilt Baalath and Tamar towns in the desert in the southern part of
Judah.
19 They also built cities where they kept the supplies for Solomon, the places where
his horses and chariots were kept. They also built everything else that Solomon
wanted them to build, in Jerusalem and in Lebanon, and in other places in the area
over which he ruled.
20 There were many people who belonged to the Amor people-group, the Heth
people-group, the Periz people-group, the Hiv people-group, and the Jebus peoplegroup who were not killed when the Israelis captured their land.
21 Their descendants still lived in Israel. It was those people whom Solomon forced
to become his slaves to build all those places, and they are still slaves.
22 But Solomon did not force any Israeli people to become slaves. Some Israelis
became soldiers and army officers and commanders and drivers of his chariots and
soldiers who rode on horses.
23 There were 550 officials who supervised the slaves who worked to build all those
places.
24 After Solomon’s wife, who was the daughter of the king of Egypt, moved from
the place outside Jerusalem called ‘The City of David’ to the palace that Solomon’s
workers built for her, Solomon told his workers to fill in the slopes on the east side of
the city.
25 Three times each year Solomon brought to the temple offerings that were
completely burned on the altar and offerings to restore fellowship with Yahweh. He
also brought incense to be burned in the presence of Yahweh.
And so his men finished building the temple.
26 King Solomon’s workers also built a fleet of ships at Ezion-Geber city, which is
near Elath city, on the shore of the Gulf of Aqaba, in the land belonging to the Edom
people-group.
workers.
28 They sailed to the Ophir region and brought back to Solomon about 16 tons of
1 KINGS 10:16

The queen of Sheba visited Solomon
1 The queen who ruled the Sheba area heard that Yahweh had caused Solomon to
become famous, so she traveled to Jerusalem to ask him questions that were difficult
to answer.
2 She came with a large group of wealthy/ influential people, and she brought
camels that were loaded with spices, and valuable gems, and a lot of gold. When
she met Solomon, she asked him questions about all the topics/things in which she
was interested.
3 Solomon answered all her questions. He explained everything that she asked
about, even things that were very difficult.
5 she saw the food that was served on his table every day; she saw where his officials
served the food and wine, and the sacrifices that he took to the temple to be offered.
She was extremely amazed.
6 She said to King Solomon, “Everything that I heard in my own country about you
and about how wise you are is true!
7 But I did not believe it was true until I came here and saw it myself. But really,
what they told me is only half of what they could have told me about you. You are
extremely wise and rich, more than what people told me.
8 Your wives are very fortunate! Your officials who are constantly standing in front
of you and listening to the wise things that you say are also fortunate!
9 Praise Yahweh, your God, who has shown that he is pleased with you by causing
you to become the king of Israel! God has always loved the Israeli people, and
therefore he has appointed you to be their king, in order that you will rule them
fairly and righteously.”
10 Then the queen gave to the king the things that she had brought. She gave him
almost five tons of gold and a large amount of spices and valuable gems. Never again
did King Solomon receive more spices than the queen gave him at that time.
11 In the ships that belonged to King Hiram, in which they had previously brought
gold from Ophir, they also brought a large amount of juniper wood and gems/valuable
stones.
12 King Solomon told his workers to use that wood to make railings/supports in
the temple of Yahweh and in the king’s palace and also to make harps and lyres for
the ◄musicians/men who played musical instruments►. That wood was the largest
amount of (OR, the finest) wood that had ever been seen in Israel. And no one since
then has ever seen so much wood of that kind.
13 King Solomon gave to the queen from Sheba everything that she wanted. He
gave her those gifts in addition to the gifts that he always gave to other rulers who
visited him. Then she and the people who came with her returned to her own land.
Solomon’s wealth
14 Each year there was brought to Solomon a total of 25 tons of gold.
15 That was in addition to the taxes paid to him by the merchants and traders, and
the annual taxes paid by the kings of Arabia and by the governors of the regions in
Israel.
16 King Solomon’s workers took this gold and hammered it into thin sheets and
covered 200 large shields with those thin sheets of gold; they put ◄almost 15 pounds/
more than 6 kg.► of gold on each shield.
1 KINGS 10:17
501
1 KINGS 11:4
17 His workers made 300 smaller shields. They covered each of them with ◄almost
4 pounds/1.5 kg.► of gold. Then the king put those shields in the Hall of the Forest of
Lebanon.
18 His workers also made for him a large throne. Part of it was covered with ◄ivory
decorations made from► tusks of elephants and part of it was covered with very fine
gold.
both sides of each step. So altogether there were twelve statues of lions. The back of
and alongside each armrest there was a small statue of a lion. No throne like that
21 All of Solomon’s cups were made of gold, and all the various dishes in the Hall
of the Forest of Lebanon were made of gold. They did not make things from silver,
because during the years that Solomon ruled, silver was not considered to be valuable.
22 The king had a ◄fleet/large number► of ships that sailed with the ships that King
Hiram owned. Every three years the ships returned from the places to which they had
sailed, bringing gold, silver, ivory, monkeys, and baboons (OR, peacocks).
23 King Solomon became richer and wiser than any other king.
24 People from all over the world wanted to come and listen to the wise things that
Solomon said, things that God had put into his mind.
25 All the people who came to him brought presents: They brought things made
from silver or gold, or robes, or weapons (OR, myrrh), or spices, or horses, or mules.
The people continued to do this every year.
26 Solomon acquired 1,400 chariots and 12,000 men who rode on the horses (OR,
in the chariots). Solomon put some of them in Jerusalem and some of them in other
cities where he kept his chariots.
27 During the years that Solomon was king, silver became as common in Jerusalem
as stones; and lumber from cedar trees in the foothills of Judah was as plentiful as
lumber from fig trees.
28 Solomon’s agents bought horses and supervised the men who brought them into
Israel from the areas of Musri and Cilicia that were famous for breeding horses.
29 In Musri they bought chariots and horses; they paid 600 pieces of silver for each
chariot and 150 pieces of silver for each horse. They brought them to Israel. Then
they sold many of them to the kings of the Heth people-group and the kings of Syria.
11
Solomon’s many wives
1 King Solomon married many foreign women.
First he married the daughter of
the king of Egypt. He also married women from the Heth people-group and from the
Moab, Ammon, and Edom people-groups, and from Sidon city.
2 He married them even though Yahweh had commanded the Israeli people, “Do
not marry people from those areas, because if you do that, they will surely persuade
you [IDM] to worship the gods that they worship!”
wives who were his slaves/servants. And his wives caused him to turn away from
worshiping God.
4 By the time that Solomon became old, they had persuaded him to worship the
gods from their countries. He was not completely dedicated/committed to Yahweh
his God like his father [SYN] David had been.
1 KINGS 11:5
502
1 KINGS 11:22
5 Solomon worshiped Astarte, the goddess that the people of Sidon worshiped, and
he worshiped Molech, the disgusting god that the Ammon people-group worshiped.
6 That’s how Solomon did things that Yahweh said were evil. He did not conduct
his life like his father David had done; he did not conduct his life as Yahweh wanted
him to.
7 On the hill to the east of Jerusalem he built a place to worship Chemosh, the
the disgusting god that the Ammon people-group worshiped.
sacrifices to the gods from their own countries.
9-10 Even though Yahweh, the God whom the Israelis worshiped, had appeared to
Solomon two times, and had commanded him to not worship foreign gods, Solomon
refused to obey Yahweh. So Yahweh was angry with Solomon,
11 and said to him, “You have chosen to break the agreement that I made with you
and to disobey what I commanded you. So I am surely not going to allow you to rule
all of your kingdom. I am going to allow one of your officials to rule it.
12 But, because of what I promised your father David, I will allow you to rule all
your kingdom while you are still living. After you die, I will not allow your son to rule
the whole kingdom [MTY].
13 But I will not take all the kingdom away from him. Instead, I will allow him to
rule one tribe besides the tribe of Judah, because of what I promised to David, who
served me well, and because I want David’s descendants to rule in Jerusalem, where
my temple is located.”
Solomon’s enemies
14 Yahweh caused Hadad, from the family of the kings in the Edom people-group,
to rebel against Solomon.
15-16 What happened was that previously, when David’s army had conquered the
Edom people-group, his army commander Joab had gone there to help bury the Israeli
soldiers who had been killed in the battle. Joab and his army remained in the Edom
area for six months, and during that time they killed all the males of that area.
17 Hadad was a young child at that time, and he had escaped to Egypt, along with
some of his father’s servants from the Edom area.
18 They went to the Midian region, and then they went to the desert area at Paran.
Some other men joined them there. Then they all traveled to Egypt and went to see
the king of Egypt. The king gave Hadad some land and ordered his servants to give
him some food regularly.
19 The king liked Hadad. As a result he gave him the sister of his own wife, Queen
Tahpenes, to be Hadad’s wife.
20 Later Hadad’s wife gave birth to a son named Genubath. The sister of Tahpenes
◄raised him/brought him up► in the palace, where he lived with the king’s sons.
21 While Hadad was in Egypt, he heard that David had died [EUP], and that Joab, the
commander of David’s army, was also dead. So he said to the king of Egypt, “Please
allow me to return to my own country.”
22 But the king said to him, “Why do you want to go back to your country? Is there
something that you lack that you want me to give to you?” Hadad replied, “No, but
please just allow me to go.” So the king allowed him to leave, and he returned to his
own country and became the king of Edom.
1 KINGS 11:23
503
1 KINGS 11:38
23 God also caused another man named Rezon, the son of Eliada, to rebel against
Solomon. Rezon had run away from his master, King Hadadezer of the Zobah area
24 Rezon then became the leader of a group of outlaws. That happened after David’s
went to Damascus and started to live there, and the people there appointed him to be
their king.
25 All during the time that Solomon was alive, while Rezon was ruling not only
Damascus but all of Syria, he was an enemy of Israel and caused trouble for Israel
like Hadad did.
What Yahweh promised to Jeroboam
26 Another man who rebelled against [IDM] Solomon was one of his officials named
Jeroboam, the son of Nebat. He was from Zeredah town in the region where the tribe
of Ephraim lives. His mother was a widow named Zeruah.
27 This is what happened. Solomon’s workers were filling in the land/ground on
the east side of Jerusalem and repairing the walls around the city.
28 Jeroboam was a very capable young man. So, when Solomon saw that he worked
very hard, he appointed him to supervise all the men who were forced to work in
the areas where the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim live.
29 One day when Jeroboam was walking alone along the road outside of Jerusalem,
the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh city met him. Ahijah was wearing a new robe,
30 which he took off and tore into twelve pieces.
31 He said to Jeroboam, “Take ten of these pieces for yourself, because Yahweh, the
God whom we Israelis worship, says to you, ‘I am going to tear the kingdom from
Solomon, and I am going to enable you to become the ruler of ten of the tribes of
Israel.
32 Solomon’s descendants will still rule one tribe (OR, two tribes), because of what
I promised David, a man who served me very well, and because of Jerusalem, the
city that I have chosen from all the cities in Israel to be the city where my people will
worship me.
33 I am going to do this because Solomon has rejected me and has been worshiping
Astarte, the goddess that the people of Sidon worship, Chemosh, the god that the Moab
people-group worship, and Milcom, the god that the Ammon people-group worship.
He has not conducted his life as I wanted him to. He has not obeyed my statutes and
laws, like his father David did.
34 ‘But I will not take the entire kingdom away from him. I will enable him to rule
Judah all during the years that he is alive. I will do that because of what I promised to
do for David, whom I chose to be the king, and who served me well, and who always
35 But I will take the other ten tribes of his kingdom and give them to you to rule.
David will always rule in Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen to be the place where
37 I will enable you to become the king of Israel, and you will rule over all the
38 If you obey all that I command you to do, and conduct your life as I want you to,
and if you do what I say is right by obeying my laws and commandments like David
did, I will help you. I will make sure that your descendants will rule after you die,
like I promised to do for David.
1 KINGS 11:39
504
1 KINGS 12:14
39 Because of Solomon’s sins,
I will punish David’s descendants, but I will not
continue to punish them forever.’ ”
Jeroboam escaped and went to Egypt. He went to Shishak, the king of Egypt, and
Solomon died
41 A record of all the other things that Solomon did, and all the wise things that he
said and wrote, was written in the Book Telling what Solomon Did.
42 He was the king in Jerusalem who ruled over all of Israel for 40 years.
43 Then Solomon died [EUP], and was buried in the part of Jerusalem called ‘The
City of David’. And his son Rehoboam became the king.
12
The ten tribes rebelled against Rehoboam
1 All [HYP] the people of northern Israel went to Shechem city in order to appoint
Rehoboam to be their king. So Rehoboam also went there.
2 When Jeroboam, who was still in Egypt, heard about that, he returned from Egypt
to Israel.
3 The leaders of the northern tribes summoned him, and they went together to talk
to Rehoboam. They said to him,
4 “Your father Solomon forced us to work very hard [MET] for him. If you ◄lighten
these loads/do not force us to work that hard►, and if you charge us less taxes than
we were paying to him, we will serve you faithfully.”
5 He replied, “Go away, and come back three days from now and I will give you my
answer.” So those leaders and Jeroboam left.
6 Then King Rehoboam consulted the older men who had advised his father
Solomon while he was still living. He asked them, “What shall I say to answer those
men?”
7 They replied, “If you want to serve your people well, speak kindly to those men
when you reply to them. If you do that, your people will always serve you faithfully.”
8 But he ignored what the older men advised him to do. Instead, he consulted the
younger men who had grown up with him, who were now ◄his advisors/the ones
who told him what would be good to do►.
9 He said to them, “What should I say to the men who are asking me to reduce the
work and taxes that my father required from them?”
10 They replied, “This is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is thicker than
my father’s waist.
11 What I mean is that my father required you to work hard and pay high taxes. But
I will make those loads heavier. It was as though my father whipped you, but it will
be as though I will whip you with whips that have pieces of metal in them.’ ”
12 So three days later, Jeroboam and all the leaders came to Rehoboam again, as he
had told them to do.
13 The king ignored the advice of the older men and spoke harshly to the Israeli
leaders.
14 He told them what the younger men had advised. He said, “My father put heavy
burdens of work and taxes on you, but I will put heavier burdens on you. It was as
though he beat you with whips, but I will beat you with whips that have pieces of
metal in them!”
1 KINGS 12:15
about Jeroboam becoming king of the ten tribes.
16 When the Israeli leaders realized that the king did not pay any attention to what
they said, they shouted,
“We do not [RHQ] want anything to do with this descendant of King David!
We will not pay attention to what this grandson of Jesse says!
You people of Israel, let’s go home!
As for this descendant of David [MTY], he can rule his own kingdom [MTY]!”
So the Israeli leaders returned to their homes.
17 And after that, the only Israeli people whom Rehoboam ruled over were those
who lived in the territory of the tribe of Judah.
18 Then King Rehoboam sent Adoniram to talk to the Israeli people. Adoniram was
the man who supervised all the men who were forced to work for Rehoboam. But
the Israeli people killed him by throwing stones at him. When that happened, King
Rehoboam quickly got in his chariot and escaped to Jerusalem.
19 Ever since that time, the people of the northern tribes of Israel have been rebelling
against the descendants [MTY] of King David.
20 When the Israeli people heard that Jeroboam had returned from Egypt, they
invited him to come to a meeting, and there they appointed him to be the king of
Israel. Only the people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin continued to be loyal to
the kings descended from King [MTY] David.
21 When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he gathered 180,000 of the best soldiers
from the tribes [MTY] of Judah and Benjamin. He wanted them to fight against the
northern tribes of [MTY] Israel and defeat them, in order that he could rule all the
tribes of his kingdom again.
22 But God spoke to the prophet Shemaiah and said this to him:
23 “Go and tell this to Solomon’s son Rehoboam, the king of Judah, and to all the
people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin and the people from the northern tribe
who live in Judah:
24 ‘Yahweh says that you must not go to fight against your own relatives, the people
of Israel. All of you must go home. What has happened is what Yahweh wanted to
happen.’ ” So Shemaiah went and told that to them, and they all paid attention to what
Yahweh had commanded them to do, and they went home.
Jeroboam’s sins
25 Then Jeroboam’s workers built walls around Shechem city in the hilly area where
the descendants of Ephraim lived, and he ruled from there for a while. He and his
workers then left there and went to Peniel town, and they built walls around that
town.
26-27 Then Jeroboam said to himself, “If my people continue to go to Jerusalem and
offer sacrifices to Yahweh at the temple there, soon they will again become loyal to
Rehoboam, the king of Judah [DOU], and they will kill me.”
28 So he consulted his advisors, and then he did what they suggested. He told his
workers to make gold statues of two calves. Then he said to the people, “You have
been going to Jerusalem to worship for a long time. It is a big trouble for you to
continue going there. You people of Israel, look! These statues are the gods that
brought our ancestors up from Egypt! So you can worship these, here!”
29 He told his workers to place one of the statues in Bethel city in the south and one
1 KINGS 13:12
30 So what Jeroboam did caused the people to sin. Some of them went and worshiped
the calf at Bethel, and others went and worshiped the other calf at Dan.
31 Moses had declared that only men from the tribe of Levi would be priests, but
Jeroboam also told his workers to build shrines on hilltops, and then he appointed
men who were not from the tribe of Levi to be priests.
32 He also appointed Adonijah and two priests, Elishama and Jehoram. They had a
celebration at the end of October, like the celebration of Living in Temporary Shelters
that occurred in Judah each year. On the altar that they built in Bethel, he offered
sacrifices to the gold statues of calves that they had made, and he stationed the priests
there at the shrines that his workers had built.
33 Jeroboam went up to that altar on that day in October which he himself had
chosen. There on that altar he burned incense to be a sacrifice. And he declared that
the people should celebrate that festival on that same day every year.
13
A prophet condemned the altar at Bethel
1 One day a prophet, obeying what Yahweh commanded him to do, went from Judah
north to Bethel. He arrived there right at the time that Jeroboam was standing at the
altar, ready to burn incense.
2 Saying what Yahweh told him to say, the prophet shouted, “This is what Yahweh
says about this altar [APO]: ‘I want you to know that some day a descendant [MTY]
of King David will be born. His name will be Josiah, and he will come here. He will
slaughter at this altar the priests who are burning incense for sacrifices on the hills
in this area, and he will burn the bones of dead people on this altar.’ ” [APO]
3 Then the prophet also said, “This is what will prove to you that Yahweh has said
this: This altar will be split apart, and the ashes that are on it will be scattered.’ ”
4 When King Jeroboam heard the prophet say that, he pointed his finger at him
and said to his servants, “Seize that man!” But immediately the king’s arm became
paralyzed/stiff, with the result that he could not move it.
5 And the altar immediately split apart, and the ashes spilled out on the ground,
which is what the prophet said that Yahweh [MTY] had predicted would happen.
6 Then the king said to the prophet, “Please pray that Yahweh will be merciful to
me and heal my arm!” So the prophet prayed, and Yahweh completely healed the
king’s arm.
7 Then the king said to the prophet, “Come home with me and eat some food. And
I will also give you a reward for what you have done!”
8 But the prophet replied, “Even if you would promise to give me half of everything
that you own [MTY], I will not go with you, and I will not eat or drink anything with
you here,
9 because Yahweh commanded me not to eat or drink anything here. He also
commanded me not to return home on the road on which I came here.”
10 So he started to return home, but he did not go on the road on which he came to
Bethel. He went on a different road.
The old prophet from Bethel
11 At that time there was an old man living in Bethel who was a prophet. His sons
came and told him what the prophet from Judah had done there on that day, and they
also told him what the prophet had said to the king.
12 Their father said, “On which road did he go?” So his sons showed him the road
on which the prophet from Judah had gone when he left Bethel.
1 KINGS 13:13
507
1 KINGS 13:33
13 Then he said to his sons, “Put a saddle on my donkey.” So they did that, and he
got on the donkey.
14 He went along the road to ◄find/catch up with► the prophet from Judah. He
found him sitting under an oak tree. He said to him, “Are you the prophet who came
from Judah?” He replied, “Yes, I am.”
15 The old prophet said to him, “Come home with me and eat some food.”
16 He replied, “No, I am not allowed to go with you into your house, or to eat or
drink anything with you,
17 because Yahweh told me, ‘Do not eat or drink anything here, and do not return
home on the road on which you came.’ ”
18 Then the old prophet said to him, “I also am a prophet, like you are. Yahweh
sent an angel to tell me that I should take you home with me and give you some food
and drink.” But the old man was lying when he said that.
19 But because of what the old prophet said, the prophet from Judah returned with
him to his home and ate some food and drank some water with him.
20 While they were sitting at the table, Yahweh spoke to the old man.
21 Then he cried out to the prophet from Judah, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘You
have disobeyed him, and you have not done what he commanded you to do.
22 Instead, you have come back here and had things to eat and drink in a place
where he commanded you not to do that. As a result, you will be killed, and your
body will not be buried in the grave where your ancestors are buried.’ ”
23 When they had finished eating, the old man put a saddle on the donkey for the
prophet from Judah, and the prophet from Judah left.
24 But as he was going, a lion met him and killed him. The prophet’s corpse was
lying on the road, and the donkey was standing beside it, and the lion was also
standing beside the corpse.
25 Some men passed by and were surprised to see the corpse on the road and the
lion standing next to the corpse. So they went into Bethel and reported what they
had seen.
26 When the old man who had brought the prophet from Judah to his home heard
about it, he said, “That is the prophet who disobeyed what Yahweh told him to do!
That is why Yahweh allowed the lion to attack him and kill him. That is what Yahweh
said would happen!”
27 Then he said to his sons, “Put a saddle on my donkey.” So they did that.
28 Then he rode on the donkey and found the prophet’s corpse on the road, and his
donkey and the lion were still standing there alongside the corpse. But the lion had
29 The old man picked up the corpse of the prophet and put it on his donkey and
30 He buried the prophet’s corpse in the grave where other people in his family had
brother!”
31 After they had buried him, the old man said to his sons, “When I die, bury my
corpse in the grave where we buried the prophet from Judah. Lay my corpse next to
his corpse.
32 And do not forget what he said, because the things that Yahweh told him to say
about the altar in Bethel, and about the shrines on the hills in the towns in Samaria,
will surely happen.”
33 But King Jeroboam still did not turn away from continuing to do evil things.
Instead, he appointed more priests who were not descended from Levi. Anyone who
1 KINGS 13:34
508
1 KINGS 14:15
wanted to be a priest, he appointed to be a priest, in order that he could offer sacrifices
on the hills.
34 Because he committed that sin, a few years later God got rid of most of Jeroboam’s
descendants and did not allow them to become kings of Israel.
14
Jeroboam’s son died
1 At that time, Jeroboam’s son Abijah became very sick.
2 Jeroboam said to his wife, “Disguise yourself, in order that no one will recognize
that you are my wife. Then go to Shiloh city, where the prophet Ahijah lives. He is
the one who predicted/prophesied that I would become the king of Israel.
3 Take with you ten loaves of bread and some small flat cakes, and a jar of honey,
and give them to him. Tell him about our son, and he will tell you what will happen
to him.”
4 So his wife went to Shiloh, to Ahijah’s house. Ahijah was unable to see, because
he was very old and had become blind.
5 But before she got there, Yahweh told Ahijah that Jeroboam’s wife was coming to
inquire about their son, who was very sick. And Yahweh told Ahijah what he should
When she came to him, she pretended to be another woman.
6 But when Ahijah heard her footsteps as she entered the doorway, he said to her,
“Come in, wife of Jeroboam! ◄Why do you pretend that you are someone else?/It will
not help you to pretend that you are someone else.► [RHQ] Yahweh has given me bad
news to tell you.
7 Go and tell Jeroboam that this is what Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship,
says to you: ‘I chose you from among the common people and enabled you to become
the king of my Israeli people.
8 I took most of the kingdom of Israel away from David’s descendants and gave it
to you. But you have not been like David, who served me very well. He obeyed all
my commandments very sincerely, doing only things that I considered to be right.
9 But you have done more evil things/deeds than all those who ruled before you.

burns dung to cook his food.
11 The corpses of any members of your family who die in cities will be eaten by
dogs. And the corpses of any members of your family who die in the open fields will
be eaten by vultures. This will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said that it will
happen.’
12 So go back home. And as soon as you enter the city, your son will die.
13 All the Israeli people will mourn for him and bury him. He is the only one
of Jeroboam’s family who will be buried properly, because he is the only one of
Jeroboam’s family with whom Yahweh is pleased.
14 Furthermore, Yahweh will appoint for himself a king to rule over Israel who will
get rid of Jeroboam’s descendants. And that will start to happen today!
15 Yahweh will punish the people of Israel; he will shake them like the wind shakes
the reeds that grow in a stream. He will expel the Israeli people from this good land
that he gave to our ancestors. He will scatter them into countries east of the Euphrates

509
1 KINGS 15:3
River, because they have caused him to become very angry by worshiping statues of
the goddess Asherah.
16 Yahweh will abandon the Israeli people because of the sins that Jeroboam
committed, sins which led the Israeli people to commit them.”
17 Jeroboam’s wife returned home to Tirzah city, the new capital of Israel. And just
as she entered her house, her son died.
18 All the Israeli people mourned for him and buried him, which is what Yahweh
had told his servant, the prophet Ahijah, would happen.
19 Everything else that Jeroboam did, and the record of wars that his army fought,
and how he ruled, is written in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Israel’.
20 Jeroboam ruled for 22 years; then he died [EUP] and his son Nadab became king.
Rehoboam died
21 Solomon’s son Rehoboam ruled Judah. He was 41 years old when he started to
rule, and he ruled for 17 years. He ruled in Jerusalem, which is the city that Yahweh
chose out of all the tribes of Israel to be the place where he should be worshiped
[MTY]. Rehoboam’s mother’s name was Naamah; she was from the Ammon peoplegroup.
22 The people of Judah did things that Yahweh considered to be evil. They caused
him to become angry because they committed more sins than their ancestors had
committed: They worshiped many other gods instead of worshiping only Yahweh.
23 They built places to worship those gods; on high hills, and under big trees they
set up stone pillars to worship the goddess Asherah.
24 Also, there were male prostitutes at these places of worship. The Israeli people
did the same disgraceful things that had been done by the people whom Yahweh had
expelled while the Israelis were advancing through the land.
25 When Rehoboam had been ruling for almost five years, King Shishak of Egypt
came with his army to attack Jerusalem.
26 They took away all the valuable things in the temple and in the king’s palace,
including the gold shields that Solomon’s workers had made.
27 King Rehoboam’s workers made bronze shields to replace them and entrusted
28 Every time that the king went into the temple, those guards carried those shields;
29 Everything else that Rehoboam did is written [RHQ] in the scroll called ‘The
History of the Kings of Judah’.
30 There were wars continually between the armies of Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
31 Then Rehoboam died [EUP], and he was buried in the part of Jerusalem called
‘The City of David’, where his ancestors were buried. Then his son Abijah became
the king.
15
King Abijah of Judah
1 After Jeroboam had been the king of Israel for almost 18 years, Abijah became
the king of Judah.
2 He ruled for three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maacah, the
granddaughter of David’s son Absalom.
3 Abijah committed the same kind of sins that his father had committed. He was
not fully dedicated/committed to Yahweh his God, as his grandfather David had been.
1 KINGS 15:4
510
1 KINGS 15:22
4 But, because of what Yahweh his God had promised to David, Yahweh gave Abijah
a son [MET] to rule in Jerusalem after him, and in order to protect Jerusalem from
their enemies.
5 Yahweh did that because David had always done what pleased Yahweh and
because David had always obeyed Yahweh. The only time when he disobeyed Yahweh
was when he caused Uriah to be killed.
6 There were wars between the armies of Rehoboam and Jeroboam all during the
time that Abijah ruled.
7 Everything else that Abijah did is written [RHQ] in the scroll called ‘The History
of the Kings of Judah’.
8 Abijah died [EUP] and was buried in the part of Jerusalem called ‘The City of David’,
and his son Asa became king.
King Asa of Judah
9 After Jeroboam had been the king of Israel for almost 20 years, Asa started to rule
Judah.
10 He ruled in Jerusalem for 41 years.
His grandmother was Maacah, the
granddaughter of Absalom.
11 Asa did what was pleasing to Yahweh, as his ancestor David had done.
12 He got rid of the male prostitutes that were at the places where the people
worshiped idols, and he also got rid of all the idols that his ancestors had made.

the high hills, but he continued to be dedicated/committed to Yahweh his entIre life.
dedicated to God, and all the gold and silver things that he had dedicated to God.
16 There were wars between the armies of Asa and Baasha, the king of Israel, all
during the time that they ruled.
17 Baasha’s army invaded Judah. They captured Ramah town north of Jerusalem.
Then they started to build a wall around it in order to prevent people from entering
or leaving the area in Judah that was ruled by King Asa.
18 So Asa told his workers to take all the silver and gold that was still in the
storerooms in the temple and in the palace. He told them to take it to Damascus and
give it to King Ben-Hadad who ruled Syria. Ben-Hadad was the son of Tabrimmon
and grandson of Hezion. He told the workers to say this to Ben-Hadad:
19 “I want there to be a peace treaty between you and me, like there was between
your father and my father. For that reason, I am giving you this silver and gold. So
now please cancel the treaty that you made with Baasha, the king of Israel, in order
that he will take his soldiers away from attacking mine, because he will be afraid of
your army.”
20 So the workers went and gave the message to Ben-Hadad, and he did what Asa
suggested. He sent his army commanders and their soldiers to attack some of the
towns in Israel. They captured Ijon, Dan, Abel-Beth-Maacah, the area near Galilee
Lake, and all the land of the tribe of Naphtali.
21 When Baasha heard about that, he told his soldiers to stop working at Ramah.
He and his soldiers returned to Tirzah and stayed there.
22 Then King Asa sent a message to all the people in the towns in Judah, stating that
they all were required to go to Ramah and carry away the stones and timber that
1 KINGS 15:23
511
1 KINGS 16:5
Baasha’s soldiers had been using to build a wall around the city. With those stones
and timber they fortified Mizpah city north of Jerusalem, and Geba, a town in the
territory of the tribe of Benjamin.
23 Everything else that Asa did, the armies that his soldiers defeated, and the names
of the cities that he caused to be fortified, are [RHQ] written in the scroll called ‘The
History of the Kings of Judah’. But when Asa became old, he got a disease in his feet.
24 He died [EUP] and was buried where his ancestors were buried in the part of
Jerusalem called ‘The City of David’. Then his son Jehoshaphat became king.
King Nadab of Israel
25 After Asa had been the king of Judah for almost two years, King Jeroboam’s son
Nadab started to rule Israel. He ruled for two years.
26 He did things that Yahweh considered to be evil. His behavior was sinful like his
father’s behavior had been, and what he did led the people of Israel to sin.
27 A man named Baasha, from the tribe of Issachar, planned to harm him. He killed
Nadab when Nadab and his army had surrounded Gibbethon city in the Philistia area.
28 That [DOU] was when Asa had been the king ruling Judah for almost three years.
Then Baasha became the king of Israel.
29 As soon as Baasha became king, he commanded his soldiers to kill all of Jeroboam’s
family. Doing what Yahweh had told the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh would happen,
30 That happened because Yahweh had become very angry with Jeroboam because
persuaded the people of Israel to commit.
31 Everything else that Nadab did is written [RHQ] in the scroll called ‘The History
of the Kings of Israel’.
32 There were wars between the armies of King Asa and King Baasha all the time
that they ruled.
King Baasha of Israel
33 After Asa had been the king of Judah for almost three years, Baasha, the son of
Ahijah, started to rule Israel at Tirzah city. He ruled for 24 years.
34 He did things that Yahweh considered to be evil, and his behavior was sinful like
his father’s had been, and he led the people of Israel to sin.
When Baasha ruled Israel
16
1 During the time that Baasha was king of Israel, the prophet Jehu, Hanani’s son,
gave Baasha this message that he had received from Yahweh:
2 “You were very insignificant/unimportant [IDM] when I caused you to become the
ruler of my Israeli people. But you have caused me to become very angry by doing
[IDM] the kinds of evil things that King Jeroboam did. You have also caused me to
become angry by causing my people to sin.
3 So now I will get rid of you and your family [MTY]. I will do to you just like I did
to Jeroboam and his family.
4 The bodies of those in your family who die in this city will not be buried; they
will be eaten by dogs; and the corpses of those who die in the fields will be eaten by
vultures.”
5 The other things that happened during the time that Baasha ruled Israel, and the
things that he did, are written [RHQ] in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of
Israel’.
1 KINGS 16:6
512
1 KINGS 16:23
6 When Baasha died, he was buried in Tirzah, the capital city.
Then his son Elah
became king.
7 Yahweh gave that message about Baasha and his family to the prophet Jehu.
Baasha had done many things that Yahweh considered to be evil, which caused
Yahweh to become angry. Baasha did the same kind of things that King Jeroboam
and his family had done previously. Yahweh was also angry with Baasha because he
had killed all of Jeroboam’s family.
When Elah ruled Israel
8 After Asa had been the king of Judah for almost 26 years, Elah became the king
of Israel. Elah ruled in Tirzah for only two years.
of half of Elah’s army’s ◄chariots/two-wheeled vehicles pulled by horses►. He made
Arza. Arza was the man who took care of the things in the king’s palace.
10 Zimri went into Arza’s house and killed Elah. Then Zimri became the king of
Israel. That was when Asa had been the king of Judah for 27 years.
11 As soon as Zimri became king [MTY], he killed all of Baasha’s family [MTY]. That
included every male [IDM] in Baasha’s family and all of Baasha’s male friends.
12 That was just what Yahweh told the prophet Jehu would happen.
13 Baasha and his son Elah had sinned and led the Israeli people to sin. They caused
Yahweh, the God whom the Israeli people worshiped, to become angry, because they
both urged the people to worship worthless idols.
14 Everything else that Elah did is written in the scroll called ‘The History of the
Kings of Israel’.
When Zimri ruled Israel
15 So Zimri became the king of Israel after Asa had been king of Judah for 27
years. But Zimri ruled in Tirzah for only seven days. The Israeli army was beseiging/
surrounding Gibeah, a town which belonged to the Philistine people-group.
16 The men in the Israeli army camp heard that Zimri had secretly planned to kill
King Elah, and then had killed him. So on that day the soldiers chose Omri, the
commander of their army, to become the king of Israel.
17 The Israeli army was camped near Gibbethon city. When they heard what Zimri
had done, they left there and went to Tirzah, and surrounded the city.
18 When Zimri realized that the city was about to be captured, he went into his
palace and set it on fire. So the palace burned down, and he died in the fire.
19 He died because he had sinned by doing the things that Yahweh considered to be
evil. Jeroboam had led the Israeli people to sin, and Zimri sinned just like Jeroboam
had sinned.
20 All the other things that Zimri did, and the record of how he rebelled against
King Elah, are written in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Israel’.
When Omri ruled Israel
21 After Zimri died, the Israeli people were divided.
One group wanted Tibni, the
son of Ginath, to be their king. The other group wanted Omri to be the king.
22 Those who supported Omri ◄were stronger than/defeated► those who supported
Tibni. So Tibni was killed, and Omri became king.
23 Omri became king when Asa had been king of Judah for almost 31 years. Omri
and he called it Samaria, to honor Shemer, the man who owned it previously.
25 But Omri did many things that Yahweh considered to be evil. He did more evil
deeds than any of the kings who ruled Israel before he did.
26 When Jeroboam was previously the king, he had led the Israeli people to sin, and
Omri committed the same kind of sins that Jeroboam did. The Israeli people caused
Yahweh, the God the Israeli people had worshiped, to become very angry, because
they worshiped worthless idols.
27 Everything that Omri did, and the record of the victories that his army won, are
written in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Israel’.
28 After Omri died, he was buried in Samaria, and his son Ahab became king.
When Ahab ruled Israel
29 Ahab became king of Israel when Asa had ruled Judah for almost 38 years. Ahab
ruled in Samaria city for 22 years.
30 Ahab did many things that Yahweh considered to be evil. He did more evil things
than any of the kings who ruled Israel before he did.
31 He committed the same kind of sins that Jeroboam did, but he did things that
were worse than the things that Jeroboam did. He married a woman named Jezebel,
the daughter of Ethbaal, the king of Sidon city. Then Ahab started to worship Baal,
the god that the Canaan people-group worshiped.
32 He built a temple in Samaria in order that the Israeli people could worship Baal
there, and he put an altar there for making sacrifices to Baal.
33 He also made an idol that represented Asherah, Baal’s wife. He did many more
things that caused Yahweh to become angry. He did more evil things than any of the
previous kings of Israel had done.
34 During the years that Ahab ruled, Hiel, a man from Bethel city, rebuilt Jericho
city. But when he started to rebuild the city, his oldest son Abiram died. And when
the city was finished, while Hiel was building the city gates, his youngest son Segub
died. They died just like Yahweh had told Joshua would happen to the sons of anyone
who would rebuild Jericho.
Crows fed Elijah
17
1 Elijah was a prophet who lived in Tishbe town in the Gilead region.
One day he
went to King Ahab and said to him, “Yahweh is the God whom we Israelis worship
and the God whom I worship and serve. Just as certainly as Yahweh lives, there will
be no dew or rain for the next few years, if I do not command rain to fall!”
2 Then Yahweh said to Elijah,
3 “Because you have made the king angry with you, escape from the king and, go to
the east, to the Kerith Brook, east of where it flows into the Jordan River.
4 You will be able to drink water from the brook, and you will be able to eat what
the crows bring to you, because I have commanded them to bring food to you.”
5 So Elijah did what Yahweh commanded him to do. He went and camped alongside
Kerith Brook.
6 Crows bought bread and meat to him every morning and every evening, and he
7 But after a while, the water in the brook dried up, because rain did not fall
anywhere in the land.
8 Then Yahweh said to Elijah,
1 KINGS 17:9
514
1 KINGS 18:2
9 “Go and live in Zarephath village, near Sidon city.
There is a widow there who
10 So Elijah did what God said. He went to Zarephath. As he arrived at the gates
of the village, he saw a widow who was gathering sticks. He said to her, “Would you
please bring me a cup of water?”
11 While she was going to get it, he called out to her, “Bring me a piece of bread,
too!”
12 But she replied, “Your God knows that what I am telling you is true: I do not
have even one piece of bread in my house. I have only a handful of flour in a jar, and
a little olive oil in a jug. I was gathering a few sticks to use these to make a fire and
cook one more meal, and then after my son and I eat that, we will die from hunger.”
13 But Elijah said to her, “Do not be worried! Go home and do what you said that
you were going to do. But first, bake me a little loaf of bread and bring it to me. After
you do that, take what is left and prepare some food for you and your son.
14 I know that you will be able to do that, because Yahweh, the God whom we
Israelis worship, says this: ‘There will always be plenty of flour and olive oil left in
your containers, until the time when I send rain again and the crops grow again!’ ”
15 So the woman did exactly what Elijah told her to do. And she and her son and
Elijah had enough food every day,
16 because the flour in the jar was never finished, and the jug of oil was never
empty. That happened just like Yahweh had told Elijah that it would happen.
Elijah restored to life the widow’s son
17 Some time later, the woman’s son became sick. He continued to get worse, and
finally he died.
18 So the woman went to Elijah and said to him, “You are a prophet; so why have
you done this to me? Have you come here to punish me for my sins by causing my
son to die?”
19 But Elijah replied, “Give your son to me.” So she gave her son to him, and he
took the boy’s body from her and carried it up the steps to the room where he stayed.
He laid the boy’s body on his bed.
20 Then Elijah cried out to Yahweh, “O Yahweh my God, this widow has kindly
allowed me to stay in her home. So why have you brought this tragedy to her and
caused her son to die?” [RHQ]
21 Then Elijah stretched himself on top of the boy’s body and called out to Yahweh
saying, “Yahweh my God, please allow this boy to become alive again!” He did this
three times.
22 Yahweh heard what Elijah prayed, and he caused the boy to become alive again
[DOU].
23 Elijah carried the boy down the steps and gave him to his mother. He said, “Look,
your son is alive!”
24 The woman said to Elijah, “Now I know for certain that you are a prophet and
that the words that you speak are truly from Yahweh!”
18
Elijah met with Obadiah
1 For almost three years there was no rain in Samaria.
Then Yahweh said this to
Elijah: “Go and meet with King Ahab and tell him that I will soon send rain.”
2 So Elijah went to talk to Ahab.
In Samaria there was almost no food for anyone to eat.
1 KINGS 18:3
515
1 KINGS 18:21
3 There was a man there named Obadiah.
He was in charge of the king’s palace.
He greatly revered Yahweh.
4 One time when Queen Jezebel had tried to kill all Yahweh’s prophets, Obadiah hid
100 of them in two caves. He put 50 prophets in each cave, and he brought food and
water to them.
5 By this time, the ◄famine/lack of food and water► had become very severe in
Samaria. So Ahab summoned Obadiah and said to him, “We must check/look near
every spring and in every valley to see if we can find enough grass to give to some
of my horses and mules, so that they will not all die.”
6 So they both started walking throughout the land. Obadiah went in one direction
by himself, and Ahab went in another direction by himself.
7 While Obadiah was walking along, he saw Elijah coming toward him. Obadiah
recognized Elijah and bowed down in front of him and said, “Is it really you, Elijah,
my master?”
8 Elijah replied, “Yes. Now go and tell Ahab, your master, that I am here.”
9 Obadiah objected. He said, “Sir, I have not [RHQ] harmed you at all. So why are
you sending me back to Ahab? He will kill me!
10 Yahweh your God knows that I am telling the truth when I solemnly declare that
King Ahab has searched in every kingdom all over the world [HYP] to find you. Each
time that some king said to him, ‘Elijah is not here,’ Ahab demanded that the king of
that country solemnly swear/declare that the king was telling the truth.
11 Now you say to me, ‘Go and tell your master that Elijah is here!’
12 But as soon as I leave you, the Spirit of Yahweh will carry you away, and I will not
know where he will take you. So when I tell Ahab that you are here and he comes to
me and he does not find you here, he will kill me! But I do not deserve to die because
I have revered Yahweh since I was a boy.
13 My master, have you not heard about what I did when Jezebel wanted to kill all
of Yahweh’s prophets? I hid 100 of them in two caves and took food and water to
them.
14 Now, sir, you say, ‘Go and tell your master that Elijah is here.’ But if I do that,
and he comes and you are not here, he will kill me!”
15 But Elijah replied, “Yahweh, the Almighty One whom I serve [IDM], knows that I
am telling the truth as I solemnly declare that I will go to meet with Ahab today.”
Elijah killed the prophets of Baal
16 So Obadiah went to tell Ahab that Elijah had come. Ahab went to meet with him.
17 When he saw Elijah, he said to him, “Is that you, the one who causes trouble for
18 Elijah replied, “It is not I who have caused trouble for the people of Israel! You
Yahweh’s commands, and you have worshiped the idols of Baal instead.
19 So now, command all the Israeli people to come to Carmel Mountain, and be sure
to bring all the 450 prophets who worship Baal and the 400 prophets who worship
the goddess Asherah, the ones to whom your wife Jezebel brings food and water.”
20 So Ahab summoned all his prophets and all the other Israeli people to the top of
Carmel Mountain, and Elijah went up there too.
21 Then Elijah stood in front of them and said, “How long [RHQ] are you going to be
undecided about who is truly God? If Yahweh is truly God, then worship/serve him.
If Baal is truly God, then worship/serve him!” But the people said nothing in reply,
because they were afraid of what Jezebel would do to them if they admitted that they
worshiped Yahweh.
1 KINGS 18:22
516
1 KINGS 18:38
22 Then Elijah said to them, “I am the only true prophet of Yahweh who is left, but
Baal has 450 prophets.
23 Bring two bulls. The prophets of Baal may choose the one that they want. They
must kill it and cut it into pieces and lay the pieces on the wood that is on the altar
that they have made. But they must not light a fire under the wood. I will kill the
other bull and cut it in pieces and lay the pieces on the altar that I make.
24 Then they must call to their god [MTY], and I will call to Yahweh. The god who
answers by lighting a fire to the wood that is on that altar is the true God!”
Then all the people thought that Elijah’s suggestion was good.
25 Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “You call to Baal first, because there are
many of you. Choose one of the bulls and prepare it, and then call to your god. But
do not light a fire under the wood!”
26 So they killed one of the bulls and cut it up and placed the pieces on the altar.
Then they called out to Baal all morning. They shouted, “Baal, answer us!” But no
one answered. There was no reply at all [DOU].
Then they danced wildly around the altar that they had made.
27 About noontime, Elijah started to make fun of them. He said, “Surely Baal is a god,
so it seems that you must shout louder! Perhaps he is thinking about something, or
perhaps he has gone to the toilet. Or perhaps he is traveling somewhere, or perhaps
he is asleep and you need to wake him up!”
28 So they shouted louder. Then, doing one of the things that they frequently did
when they worshiped Baal, they slashed/cut themselves with knives and swords until
a lot of blood flowed.
29 They continued calling out to Baal all afternoon. But there was no reply, no
answer, no god who paid attention.
30 Then Elijah called to the people saying, “Come closer!” So they all crowded
around him. Then Elijah repaired the altar of Yahweh that had previously been
◄ruined/torn down► by the prophets of Baal.
31 Then he took twelve large stones, each one to represent one of the Israeli tribes.
The names of those tribes were given to them by their ancestor Jacob.
32 With these stones he rebuilt Yahweh’s altar. Then around the altar he dug a little
ditch that was large enough to hold about ◄three gallons/12 liters► of water.
he laid the pieces on top of the wood. Then he said, “Fill four large jars with water,
34 Then he said, “Do the same thing again!” So they did it again. Then he said “Do
35 As a result, the water flowed down below the altar and filled the ditches.
and prayed. He said, “Yahweh, you who are the God that our ancestors Abraham and
Isaac and Jacob worshiped, prove today that you are the God whom the Israeli people
should worship, and prove that I am your servant. Prove that I have done all these
things because you told me to do them.
37 Yahweh, answer me! Answer me in order that these people will know that you,
Yahweh God, have the power to do what you say that you will do, and that you have
caused them to trust in [IDM] you again!”
38 Immediately a fire from Yahweh flashed down from the sky. The fire burned up
the pieces of meat, the wood, the stones, and the dirt that was around the altar. It
even dried up all the water in the ditch!
1 KINGS 18:39
517
1 KINGS 19:9
39 When the people saw that, they prostrated themselves on the ground and shouted,
“Yahweh is God! Yahweh is God!”
40 Then Elijah commanded them, “Seize all the prophets of Baal! Do not allow any
of them to escape!” So the people seized all the prophets of Baal, and took them down
the mountain to the Kishon Valley, and Elijah killed them all there.
Elijah prayed for rain
41 Then Elijah said to Ahab, “Go and get something to eat and drink.
But do it
quickly, because it is soon going to rain very hard!”
42 So Ahab and his men left to prepare a big meal. But Elijah went back up to the
top of Carmel Mountain and prayed.
43 Then he said to his servant, “Go and look out toward the sea, to see if there are
any rain clouds.” So his servant went and looked, and came back and said, “I do not
see anything.” This happened six times.
44 But when the servant went the seventh time, he came back and said, “I saw a
very small cloud above the sea. As I extend my arm, the cloud is about the size of my
hand/fist.”
Then Elijah shouted to him, “Go and tell King Ahab to get his chariot ready and go
home immediately! If he does not do that, the rain will stop him!”
45 Very soon the sky was full of black clouds. There was a strong wind, and then
it began to rain very hard. Ahab got into his chariot and started to return to Jezreel
city.
46 Yahweh gave extra strength to Elijah. He tucked his cloak into his belt in order
to run fast, and he ran ahead of Ahab’s chariot all the way 17 miles/26 km. to Jezreel.

Elijah fled to the desert and then to Sinai Mountain
1 When Ahab got home, he told his wife Jezebel what Elijah had done. He told her
that Elijah had killed all the prophets of Baal.

He left his servant there.
down under a broom tree and prayed that Yahweh would allow him to die. He said,
“Yahweh, I’ve had enough. So allow me to die, because for me to live is no better
than being with my ancestors who have died.”
5 Then he lay down under the broom tree and slept. But while he was sleeping, an
angel touched him and woke him up and said to him, “Get up and eat some food!”
6 Elijah looked around and saw some bread which had been baked on hot stones,
and he also saw a jar of water. So he ate some bread and drank some water and lay
down to sleep again.
7 Then the angel who had been sent by Yahweh came again and touched him, and
said, “Get up and eat some more food, because you need more strength to go on a
long journey.”
8 So he got up and ate and drank some more, and because of doing that, he got
enough strength to enable him to travel for forty days and nights to Sinai Mountain,
the mountain that was dedicated to God.
9 He went into a cave there and slept there that night.
1 KINGS 19:10

1 KINGS 19:21
Yahweh gave instructions to Elijah
The next morning, Yahweh said to him “Elijah, why are you here?”
10 Elijah replied, “I have zealously served you, Yahweh, God Almighty. But the
Israeli people have broken the agreement that they made with you. They have torn
down your altars, and they have killed all of your prophets. I am the only one whom
they have not killed, and now they are trying to kill me, too. So I am running away
from them.”
11 Yahweh said to him, “Go out and stand in front of me on this mountain while I
pass by.” Suddenly a strong windstorm struck the mountain. As a result, rocks were
loosened from the mountainside. But Yahweh was not in the wind. Then there was
an earthquake, but Yahweh was not in the earthquake.
12 Then there was a fire, but Yahweh was not in the fire. Then there was a sound
like someone whispering quietly.
13 When Elijah heard that, he wrapped his cloak around his face. He went out of
the cave and stood at its entrance. And he heard Yahweh speaking to him, saying
again, “Elijah, why are you here?”
14 He replied again, “I have zealously served you, Yahweh, God Almighty. But the
Israeli people have broken the agreement that they made with you. They have torn
down your altars, and they have killed all of your prophets. I am the only one whom
they have not killed, and now they are trying to kill me, too. So I am running away
from them.”
15 Then Yahweh told him, “Go back to the desert near Damascus. When you arrive
there, anoint with olive oil a man named Hazael, to appoint him to be the king of
Syria.
Elisha the son of Shaphat, from Abel-Meholah town, to become my prophet after you
17 Hazael’s army will kill many people, and those who escape from being killed by
his army will be killed by Jehu’s army, and those who escape from being killed by
Jehu’s army will be killed by Elisha.
18 But you need to know that there are still 7,000 people in Israel who have never
bowed to worship Baal or kissed his idol.”
Elijah summoned Elisha
19 So Elijah went to Syria and found Elisha as he was plowing a field with a team of
oxen. There were eleven other men who were in front of him, plowing with teams
of oxen in the same field. Elijah went to Elisha, and took off his own coat and put it
on Elisha, to show Elisha that he wanted him to take his place as a prophet. Then he
started to walk away.
20 Elisha left the oxen standing there and ran after Elijah, and said to him, “I will
go with you, but first let me kiss my parents goodbye.”
Elijah replied, “Okay, go home. But do not forget why I have given my cloak to you!”
21 So Elisha went back to his oxen. He killed them and cut them in pieces and used
the wood from the plow to build a fire to roast the meat. He distributed the meat to
the other people in his town, and they all ate some. Then he went with Elijah and
became his helper.

The Syrian army attacked Israel
1 KINGS 20:1
519
1 KINGS 20:17
1 Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, gathered all his army, and he persuaded 32 other
kings to join him with their armies and horses and chariots. They marched to Samaria
city, the capital of Israel, and surrounded it, and prepared to attack it.
2 Ben-Hadad sent messengers into the city to King Ahab, to say this to him: “This is
what King Ben-Hadad says:
3 ‘You must give to me all your silver and gold, your ◄good-looking/most beautiful►
wives/women and strongest children.’ ”
4 The king of Israel replied to them, “Tell this to King Ben-Hadad: ‘I agree to do
what you requested. You can have me and everything that I own.’ ”
5 The messengers told that to Ben-Hadad, and he sent them back with another
message: “I sent a message to you saying that you must give me all your silver and
gold and your wives and your children.
6 But in addition to that, about this time tomorrow, I will send some of my officials
to search your palace and the houses of your officials, and to bring to me everything
that pleases them.”
7 King Ahab summoned all the leaders of Israel, and said to them, “You can see/
message insisting that I must give him my wives and my children, my silver and my
8 The leaders and all the other people said to him, “Do not pay any attention to him!
9 So Ahab said to Ben-Hadad’s messengers, “Tell the king that I agree to give him
anything that they want from my palace and from the houses of my officials.” So the
messengers reported that to King Ben-Hadad, and they returned with another message
from Ben-Hadad.
10 In that message he said, “We will destroy your city completely, with the result that
there will not be enough dust and rubble left for each of my soldiers to have one
handful! I hope/wish that the gods will strike me dead if we do not do that!”
11 King Ahab replied to the messengers, “Tell King Ben-Hadad that a soldier who is
putting on his armor preparing to fight a battle [MTY] should not boast at that time;
he should wait until after he wins the battle.”
12 Ben-Hadad heard that message while he and the other rulers were drinking wine
in their temporary shelters. He told his men to prepare to attack [MTY] the city. So
his men did that.
Ahab’s soldiers won their first victory over the Syrians
13 At that moment, a prophet came to King Ahab and said to him, “This is what
Yahweh says: ‘Do not be at all afraid of [RHQ] the large enemy army that you see! I
will enable your army to defeat them today, and you will know that it is I, Yahweh,
who have the power to do what I say that I will do.’ ”
14 Ahab asked, “What group of our army will defeat them?” The prophet replied,
“The young soldiers who are commanded by the district governors will do it.” The
king asked, “Who should lead the attack?” The prophet replied, “You should!”
15 So Ahab gathered the young soldiers who were commanded by the district
governors. There were 232 of those men. Then he also summoned all the Israeli
army. There were only 7,000 soldiers.
16 They started to attack at noon, while Ben-Hadad and the other rulers were getting
drunk in their temporary shelters.
17 The young soldiers advanced first. Some scouts who had been sent out by BenHadad reported to him, “There are men coming out of Samaria city”!
1 KINGS 20:18
520
1 KINGS 20:33
18 He said, “It does not matter whether they are coming to fight against us or to ask
for peace. Capture them, but do not kill them
19 The young Israeli soldiers went out of the city to attack the Syrian army, and the
other soldiers in the Israeli army followed them.
20 Each Israeli soldier killed a Syrian soldier. The rest of the Syrian army then ran
away, and the Israeli soldiers pursued them. But King Ben-Hadad escaped riding his
horse, along with some other men riding horses.
21 Then the king of Israel went out of the city, and he and his soldiers captured all
the other Syrian horses and chariots, and also killed a large number of Syrian soldiers.
22 Then that same prophet went to King Ahab and said to him, “Go back and prepare
your soldiers, and think carefully about what will be necessary for you to do, because
the king of Syria with attack with his army again in the springtime of next year.”
23 After the Syrian army was defeated, Ben-Hadad’s officials said to him, “The gods
that the Israelis worship are gods who live in the hills. Samaria is built on a hill, and
that is why their soldiers were able to defeat us. But if we fight against them in the
plains/lowlands, we certainly will be able to defeat them.
24 So, this is what you should do: You must remove the 32 kings who are leading
your troops and replace them with army commanders.
25 Then gather an army like the army that was defeated. Gather an army that has
as many horses and chariots as the first army had. Then we will fight the Israelis in
the plains/lowlands, and we will surely defeat them.”
Ben-Hadad agreed with them, and he did what they suggested.
26 In the spring of the following year, he gathered his soldiers and marched with
them to Aphek city east of Galilee Lake, to fight against the Israeli army.
27 The Israeli army was also gathered together, and they were equipped with the
things that they needed for the battle. Then they marched out and formed two groups
facing the Syrian army. Their army was very small; they resembled two small flocks
of goats, whereas the Syrian army was very large and spread all over the countryside.
28 A prophet came to King Ahab and said to him, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘The
Syrians say that I am a god who lives in the hills, and that I am not a god who lives
in the valleys. So I will show that they are wrong by enabling your men to defeat this
huge army [IDM] in the valley, and you will know that I, Yahweh, have done it.’ ”
29 The two armies stayed in their tents for seven days, in groups that faced each
other. Then, on the seventh day, they started fighting. The Israeli army killed 100,000
Syrian soldiers.
30 The other Syrian soldiers ran away into Aphek City. Then the wall of the city
collapsed and killed 27,000 more Syrian soldiers.
Ben-Hadad also escaped into the city, and hid in the back room of a house.
31 His officials went to him and said, “We have heard a report that the Israelis act
mercifully. So allow us to go to the king of Israel, wearing coarse sacks around our
waists and ropes on our heads/necks to indicate that we will be his slaves. Perhaps if
we do that, he will allow you to remain alive.”
32 The king permitted them to do that, so they wrapped coarse sacks around their
waists and put ropes on their heads/necks, and they went to the king of Israel and
said to him, “Ben-Hadad, who greatly respects you, says, ‘Please do not kill me.’ ”
Ahab replied, “Is he still alive? He is like a brother to me!”
33 Ben-Hadad’s officials were trying to find out if Ahab would act mercifully,
and when Ahab said “brother,” they ◄were optimistic/thought that Ahab would be
merciful►. So they replied, “Yes, he is like your brother!” Ahab said, “Go and bring
1 KINGS 20:34
521
1 KINGS 21:5
him to me.” So they went and brought Ben-Hadad to him. When Ben-Hadad arrived,
Ahab told him to get in his chariot and sit with him.
34 Ben-Hadad said to him, “I will give back to you the towns that my father’s army
took from your father. And I will allow you to set up market areas for your merchants
in Damascus my capital, just as my father did in Samaria your capital.” Ahab replied,
“Because you agree to do that, I will not execute you.” So Ahab made an agreement
with Ben-Hadad, and allowed him to go home.
35 Then Yahweh spoke to a member of a group of prophets and said to him, “Ask
one of your fellow prophets to strike and wound you.” So he did what Yahweh told
him to do. He said to one of his fellow prophets, ‘Strike me and wound me.’ But that
man refused to do it.
36 So the prophet said to him, “Because you refused to obey what Yahweh told you
to do, a lion will kill you as soon as you leave me.” And as soon as he left that prophet,
a lion suddenly pounced on him and killed him.
37 Then the prophet found another prophet, and said to him, “Strike me!” So that
man hit him very hard and injured him.
38 Then the prophet put a large bandage/cloth over his face so that no one would
recognize him. Then he went and stood alongside the road, waiting for the king to
come by.
39 When the king passed by, the prophet cried out to him, saying “Your majesty,
after I was wounded while I was fighting in a battle, a soldier brought to me one of
our enemies that he had captured, and said to me, ‘Guard this man! If he escapes, you
must pay me 3,000 pieces of silver, and if you do not pay that, you will be executed!’
40 But while I was busy doing other things, the man escaped!” The king of Israel
said to him, “That is your problem! You yourself have said that you deserve to be
punished.”
41 The prophet immediately took off the bandage, and the king of Israel recognized
that he was one of the prophets.
42 And the prophet said to him, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘You have allowed that
man Ben-Hadad to escape after I commanded you to be sure to execute him! Since
you did not do that, you will be killed instead. And your army will be destroyed
because you allowed some of his army to escape!’ ”
43 The king went back home to Samaria, very angry and depressed/dejected.
21
Jezebel arranged for Naboth to be killed
1 King Ahab had a palace in Jezreel city. Near the palace was a vineyard owned by
a man from that city whose name was Naboth.
2 One day, Ahab went to Naboth and said to him, “Your vineyard is close to my
palace. I would like to buy it, so that I can plant some vegetables there. In exchange,
I will give you a better vineyard somewhere else, or if you prefer, I will pay you for
your vineyard.”
3 But Naboth replied, “That land belonged to my ancestors, so I want to keep it. I
hope that Yahweh will never allow me to give that land to you!”
4 So Ahab became very sullen and angry because of what Naboth had said. He went
home and lay down on his bed. He turned his face toward the wall, and he refused
to eat anything.
you refusing to eat anything?”
1 KINGS 21:6
522
1 KINGS 21:23
6 Ahab replied, “I talked to Naboth, that man from Jezreel. I told him that I wanted
his vineyard. I said, ‘I will buy it from you, or I will give you another vineyard for
it.’ But he refused to let me have it.”
7 His wife replied, “You are [RHQ] the king of Israel, so you can get whatever you
want Get up, and eat some food and do not worry about what Naboth said. I will get
8 Then Jezebel wrote some letters, and she signed Ahab’s name on them. She used
important men who lived in Naboth’s town.
9 This is what she wrote in the letters: “Proclaim a day when all the people will
gather together and ◄fast/abstain from eating food►. Give to Naboth an important
place to sit among them.
10 Then find two men who always cause trouble. Give them places to sit opposite/
facing him. Tell these men to testify that they heard Naboth say things that criticized
God and the king. Then take Naboth out of the city and kill him by throwing stones
at him.”
11 The leaders received the letters and did what Jezebel had written in the letters
for them to do.
12 They declared a day on which the people would all ◄fast/abstain from food►.
And they gave Naboth a seat in a place where honored people sat, in front of the
people.
13 Two men who always caused trouble sat opposite/facing Naboth. While everyone
was listening, they stated that they had heard Naboth say things that criticized God
and the king. So the people seized Naboth. They took him outside the city and killed
him by throwing stones at him.
14 Then those leaders sent a message to Jezebel, saying “We have executed Naboth.”
15 When Jezebel found out that Naboth had been killed, she told Ahab, “Naboth is
dead. Now you can go and take possession of the vineyard that he refused to sell to
you.”
16 When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went to the vineyard to
claim that he now owned it.
17 Then Yahweh spoke to Elijah the prophet. He said,
18 “Go to Samaria and talk to Ahab, the king of Israel. He is in the vineyard of a
man named Naboth. He has gone there to claim that he now owns it.
19 Tell Ahab that this is what I, Yahweh, say to him: ‘You have murdered Naboth
and taken his land.’ So I am telling you this: ‘In the same place where Naboth died
and dogs came and licked up Naboth’s blood, you will die and the dogs will lick up
your blood, too!’ ”
20 So when Elijah met with Ahab, Ahab said to him, “You, my enemy, have found
me!” [RHQ] Elijah answered, “Yes, I have found you. You have never stopped doing
the things that Yahweh says are wrong.
21 So this is what Yahweh says to you: ‘I will soon get rid of you. I will kill you,
and I will also kill every male in your household, including those who are slaves and
those who are not slaves.
22 Your family will all be killed, just like the family of King Jeroboam and like the
family of King Baasha were killed. I will get rid of you because you have caused me
to become very angry, and you have also led the Israeli people to sin.’
23 Yahweh has also told me that your wife Jezebel will be killed, and dogs in Jezreel
will eat her corpse.
1 KINGS 21:24
523
1 KINGS 22:10
24 The dead bodies of the members of your family who die in this city will not be
buried, they will be eaten by dogs, and the corpses of those who die in the fields will
25 There was no man no man like Ahab who always did things that Yahweh
considered to be evil. His wife Jezebel incited/urged him to do many of those things.
26 The most abominable/detestable thing that Ahab did was to worship idols, just
like the Amor people-group had done. And that is why Yahweh took the Amor people’s
land from them and gave it to the Israelis.
27 After Elijah finished talking to Ahab, Ahab tore his clothes to show that he was
sorry for all the sins that he had committed. He put on rough clothes that were made
from sacks, and he refused to eat anything. He even wore those rough clothes made
from sacks when he slept, to show that he was sorry.
28 Then Yahweh said this to Elijah:
29 “I have seen [RHQ] that Ahab is now very sorry for all the evil things that he has
done. So the things that I promised to do to his family will not happen while he is
still alive. I will cause them to happen after his son becomes king. Then those things
will happen to his family.” [MTY]
22
Jehoshaphat talked with Ahab
1 For almost three years there was no war between Syria and Israel.
2 Then King Jehoshaphat, who ruled Judah, went to visit King Ahab, who ruled
Israel.
3 While they were talking, Ahab said to his officials, “Do you realize that the Syrians
are still occupying our city of Ramoth in the Gilead region? And we are doing nothing
to retake that city!”
4 Then he turned to Jehoshaphat and asked, “Will your army join my army to fight
against the people of Ramoth and retake that city?”
Jehoshaphat replied, “Certainly I will do whatever you want, and you may command
my troops. You may take my horses into battle, also.”
5 Then he added, “But we should ask Yahweh first, to find out what he wants us to
do.”
6 So Ahab summoned about 400 of his prophets together, and he asked them,
“Should my army go to fight the people in Ramoth and retake that city, or not?”
They answered, “Yes, go and attack them, because God will enable your army to
defeat them.”
7 But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no prophet of Yahweh here whom we can ask?”
8 The King of Israel replied, “There is one man we can talk to. We can ask him if
he can find out what Yahweh wants. His name is Micaiah; he is the son of Imlah. But
I hate him, because when he ◄prophesies/tells what God says to him► he never says
that anything good will happen to me. He always predicts that bad things will happen
to me.”
Jehoshaphat replied, “King Ahab, you should not say that!”
9 So the king of Israel told one of his officers to summon Micaiah immediately.
Micaiah prophesied against Ahab
people threshed grain, near the gate of Samaria city. All of Ahab’s prophets were
1 KINGS 22:11
524
1 KINGS 22:28
11 One of them, whose name was Zedekiah, the son of Kenaanah, had made from
iron something that resembled horns of a bull. Then he proclaimed to Ahab, “This is
what Yahweh says: ‘With horns like these your army will keep attacking the Syrians
like a bull attacks another animal [MET], until you completely destroy them!’ ”
12 All the other prophets of Ahab agreed. They said, “Yes! If you go up to attack
Ramoth city in the Gilead region, you will be successful, because Yahweh will enable
you to defeat them!”
13 Meanwhile, the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, “Listen to
me! All the other prophets are predicting that the king’s army will defeat the Syrians.
So be sure that you agree with them and say ◄what will be favorable/that the king’s
army will be successful►.”
14 But Micaiah replied, “As surely as Yahweh lives, I will tell him only what Yahweh
tells me to say.”
15 When Micaiah came to Ahab, Ahab asked him, “Micaiah, should we go to fight
against the people of Ramoth, or not?”
Micaiah replied, “Sure, go! Yahweh will enable your army to defeat them!”
16 But King Ahab realized that Micaiah was ◄lying/being sarcastic►, so he said to
Micaiah, “I have told you [RHQ] many times that you must always tell only the truth
when you say what Yahweh has revealed to you!”
17 So Micaiah said to him, “The truth is that in a vision I saw all the troops of
Israel scattered on the mountains. They seemed to be like sheep that did not have
a shepherd. And Yahweh said, ‘Their master has been killed. So tell them all to go
home peacefully.’ ”
18 Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “I told you [RHQ] that he never predicts that anything
good will happen to me! He always predicts that bad things will happen to me.”
19 But Micaiah continued, saying, “Listen to what Yahweh showed to me! In a vision
I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, with all the armies of heaven surrounding him,
on his right side and on his left side.
20 And Yahweh said, ‘Who can persuade Ahab to go to fight against the people of
Ramoth, in order that he may be killed there?’
Some suggested one thing, and others suggested something else.
21 Finally one evil spirit came to Yahweh and said, ‘I can do it!’
22 Yahweh asked him, ‘How will you do it?’
The spirit replied, ‘I will go and inspire all of Ahab’s prophets to tell lies.’ Yahweh
said, ‘You will be successful; go and do it!’
23 So now I tell you that Yahweh has caused all of your prophets to lie to you.
Yahweh has decided that something terrible will happen to you.”
24 Then Zedekiah walked over to Micaiah and slapped him on his face. He said, “Do
you think that Yahweh’s Spirit left me in order to speak to you?” [RHQ]
25 Micaiah replied, “You will find out for yourself which of us Yahweh’s Spirit has
Syrian troops!”

give him only bread and water. Do not give him anything else to eat until I return
28 Micaiah replied, “If you return safely, it will be clear that it was not Yahweh who
told me what to say to you!” Then he said to all those who were standing there, “Do
not forget what I have said to King Ahab!”
1 KINGS 22:29
525
1 KINGS 22:47
Ahab died in the battle
29 So the King of Israel and the King of Judah led their armies to Ramoth, in the
Gilead region.
30 King Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “I will put on different clothes, in order that no
one will recognize that I am the king. But you should wear your ◄royal robe/robe that
shows that you are a king►.” So Ahab disguised himself, and they both went into the
battle.
31 The King of Syria told this to his thirty-two men who were driving the chariots:
“Attack only the king of Israel!”
32 So when the men who were driving the Syrian chariots saw Jehoshaphat wearing
◄his royal robes/clothes that showed he was the king►, they pursued him. They
shouted, “There is the king of Israel!” But when Jehoshaphat cried out,
33 they realized that he was not the king of Israel. So they stopped pursuing him.
34 But one Syrian soldier shot an arrow at Ahab, without knowing that it was Ahab.
The arrow struck Ahab between the places where the parts of his armor joined
together. Ahab told the driver of his chariot, “Turn the chariot around and take
me out of here! I have been severely wounded!”
35 The battle continued all the day. Ahab was sitting propped up in his chariot,
facing the Syrian troops. The blood from his wound ran down to the floor of the
chariot. And late in the afternoon he died.
36 Just as the sun was going down, someone among the Israeli troops shouted, “The
battle is ended! Everyone should return home!”
37 So king Ahab died, and they took his body in the chariot to Samaria city and
buried his body there.
38 They washed his chariot alongside the pool in Samaria, a pool where the
prostitutes bathed. And dogs came and licked the king’s blood, just like Yahweh had
predicted would happen.
39 The account/record of the other things that happened while Ahab was ruling,
and about the palace decorated with much ivory that they built for him, and the cities
that were built for him, was written in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of
Israel’.
40 When Ahab died, his body was buried where his ancestors were buried. Then
his son Ahaziah became king.
Jehoshaphat ruled in Judah
41 Before King Ahab died, when he had been ruling in Israel for four years, Asa’s
son Jehoshaphat started to rule in Judah.
42 Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he started to rule, and he ruled in
Jerusalem for twenty-five years. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.
43 Jehoshaphat was a good king, just like his father Asa had been. He did things
that pleased Yahweh. But while he was king, he did not remove all the pagan altars
that the people had built on the hilltops. So the people continued to offer sacrifices to
idols on those altars and burned incense there.
44 Jehoshaphat also made a peace agreement with the king of Israel.
45 All the other things that happened while Jehoshaphat was ruling, and the great
things that he did and the victories his troops won, are written in the scroll called
‘The History of the Kings of Judah’.
46 Jehoshaphat’s father Asa had tried to expel the male prostitutes that stayed at the
pagan shrines, but some of them were still there. Jehoshaphat got rid of them.
47 At that time, there was no king in Edom; a ruler who had been appointed by
Jehoshaphat ruled there.

1 KINGS 22:53
48 Jehoshaphat ordered some Israeli men to build a fleet/group of ships to sail south
to the Ophir region to get gold. But they were wrecked at Ezion-Geber/Elath, so the
ships never sailed.
49 Before the ships were wrecked, Ahab’s son Ahaziah suggested to Jehoshaphat,
“Allow my sailors to go with your sailors,” but Jehoshaphat refused.
50 When Jehoshaphat died, his body was buried where his ancestors were buried

51 Before King Jehoshaphat died, when he had been ruling in Judah for 17 years,
Ahab’s son Ahaziah began to rule in Israel. Ahaziah ruled in Samaria for two years.
52 He did many things that Yahweh considered to be evil, doing the evil things that
his father and mother had done and the evil things that Jeroboam had done—the king
who had led all the Israeli people to sin by worshiping idols.
53 Ahaziah bowed in front of Baal’s idol and worshiped it. That caused Yahweh,
the God who was the true God of the Israeli people, to become very angry, just as
Ahaziah’s father had caused Yahweh to become angry.

Elijah condemned King Ahaziah
1 After King Ahab died, the country of Moab rebelled against Israel.
2 One day, Ahaziah, the new king of Israel, fell through the wooden slats/boards
around the edge of the flat roof of his palace in Samaria. He was badly injured, so
he summoned some messengers and told them, “Go to Ekron city in Philistia, and ask
their god Baalzebub whether I will ◄recover/become well►.”
3 But an angel from Yahweh said to Elijah, the prophet from Tishbe town, “The king
of Samaria is sending some messengers to Ekron. Go and meet them and say to them,
‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to Ekron to ask Baalzebub,
the god of those people, whether you will recover?
4 Yahweh says that you should tell King Ahaziah that he will not recover from his
being injured; he will surely die.’ ”
5 So Elijah went to meet the messengers and told that to them, and they returned
to the king instead of going to Ekron. The king asked them, “Why did you return so
soon?”
6 They replied, “A man came to meet us, and said to us, ‘Return to the king who
sent you and tell him that Yahweh says, “◄Is it because there no God in Israel that
you are sending messengers to Ekron to consult Baalzebub, their god?/You seem to
think there is no God in Israel, with the result that you are sending messengers to
Ekron to ask Baalzebub, their god, whether you will recover.► [RHQ] Go tell the king
that he will not recover from being injured; instead, he will surely die.” ’ ”
7 The king said to them, “The man who came to meet you and told that to you, what
did he look like?”
8 They replied, “He was a hairy man and he had a wide leather belt around his
waist.” The king exclaimed, “That was Elijah!”
9 Then the king sent an officer with 50 soldiers to seize Elijah. They found Elijah
that you come down here!”

11 When the king found out about that, he sent another officer with 50 more soldiers.
They went to where Elijah was, and the officer called out to him, “Prophet, the king
commands that you come down immediately!”
12 But Elijah replied, “I am a prophet; to prove that, I command that fire come down
from the sky and kill you and your soldiers!” Then a fire from God came down from
the sky and killed the officer and his soldiers.
13 When the king heard about that he sent another officer with 50 more soldiers.
They went to where Elijah was, and the officer prostrated himself in front of Elijah,
and said to him, “Prophet, I plead with you, be kind to me and my 50 soldiers, and
◄do not kill us/allow us to remain alive►!

16 When Elijah arrived, he said to the king, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘You sent
You acted as though [RHQ] there is no God in Israel to consult. So you will not recover
from being injured; instead, you are going to die!’ ”
17 So Ahaziah died, which is what Yahweh told Elijah would happen. Ahaziah’s
younger brother Joram became the new king, when Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat,
had been ruling Judah for almost two years. Ahaziah’s brother became the king
because Ahaziah had no son to become the king.
18 If you want to know about all the other things that Ahaziah did, they are [RHQ]
written in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Israel’.

Elijah is taken up to heaven
1 When Yahweh was about to take the prophet Elijah up to heaven in a ◄whirlwind/
twisting wind►, Elijah and his fellow prophet Elisha were traveling south from Gilgal
town.
2 Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, because Yahweh has told only me to go to Bethel
town.”
But Elisha replied, “Just as certainly as Yahweh lives and you live, I will not leave
you!”
So they went down together to Bethel.
3 A group of prophets came to Elisha and Elijah before they entered the town, and
they asked Elisha, “Do you know that Yahweh is going to take your master/boss Elijah
away from you today?”
Elisha answered, “Certainly I know that, but don’t talk about it!” [IDM]
4 Then Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, because Yahweh has told only me to go to
Jericho.”
But Elisha replied again, “Just as certainly as Yahweh lives and you live, I will not
leave you!”
So they went together to Jericho city.
and said to him, “Do you know that Yahweh is going to take your master/boss Elijah
He answered again, “Certainly I know that, but don’t talk about it!” [IDM]
the Jordan River.”
But again Elisha replied, “As certainly as Yahweh lives and you live, I will not leave
you!”
So they continued walking together.
7 Fifty men from a group of prophets who were from Jericho also went, but they
watched from a distance as Elijah and Elisha stopped at the edge of the Jordan River.
8 Then Elijah rolled up his cloak and struck the water with it. A path opened up for
them through the river, and they walked across as though they were on dry ground.
9 When they came to the other side, Elijah said to Elisha, “What do you want me to
do for you before ◄I am taken away/Yahweh takes me away►?”
2 KINGS 2:10
529
2 KINGS 2:24
Elisha replied, “I want to receive twice as much of your power as you have had,
(OR enable me to very powerfully continue your ministry).”
10 Elijah replied, “You have asked for something which is difficult for me to cause
to happen. But, if you see me when ◄I am taken from you/Yahweh takes me from
you►, you will get what you are requesting. But if you do not see me, then you will
not get it.”
11 As they were walking and talking, suddenly a chariot that had fire surrounding it,
pulled by horses which also had fire surrounding them, appeared. The chariot driver
drove the chariot between Elijah and Elisha and separated them. Then Elijah was
taken up to heaven in a ◄whirlwind/twisting wind►.
12 Elisha saw it. He cried out, “My father/master! My father/master! The chariots
of us Israeli people and their drivers have taken my master away!” They disappeared
into the sky, and Elisha never saw Elijah again. Then Elisha tore his own robe into
two pieces to show that he was sad.
13 Elijah’s cloak had fallen off when he was taken away, so Elisha picked it up and
returned to the bank of the Jordan River.
14 He rolled up the cloak and struck the water with it, and cried out, “Will Yahweh,
the God who enabled Elijah to perform miracles, enable me to do similar things?” Then
the water separated, and a path opened up for him, and Elisha went across.
15 When the group of prophets from Jericho saw what happened, they exclaimed,
“Elisha now has the power that Elijah had!” [MTY] They walked over to him and
bowed down in front of him.
for your master on the other side of the river. Perhaps the Spirit of Yahweh has left
Elisha replied, “No, do not send them.”
17 But they kept insisting. Finally he was tired of saying “No,” and he said, “Okay,
send them.” So 50 men searched for three days, but they did not find Elijah.
18 They returned to Jericho, and Elisha was still there. He said to them, “I told you
that you should not go, because you would not find him!” [RHQ]
Elisha made the water pure
19 Then the leaders of Jericho city came to talk with Elisha. One of them said, “Our
master, we have a problem. You can see that this is a very nice place to live in. But
the water is bad, and as a result, crops will not grow on the land.”
20 Elisha said to them, “Put some salt in a new bowl and bring the bowl to me.” So
they brought it to him.
21 Then he went out to the spring from which the people in the town got water. He
threw the salt into the spring. Then he said, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘I have made
this water good/pure. No longer will anyone die, from having drunk this water, and
now crops will be able to grow.’ ” [LIT]
22 And the water became pure, just as Elisha said it would be. Since that time it has
always remained pure.
Elisha cursed boys who made fun of him
23 Elisha left Jericho and went up to Bethel.
As he was walking along the road,
a group of young boys from Bethel saw him and started to make fun of him. They
continued shouting, “Go away, you bald-headed man!”
24 Elisha turned around and looked/glared at them. He asked Yahweh to ◄curse
them/do something bad to them►. Immediately two bears came out of the woods
and mauled forty-two of them.
2 KINGS 2:25

2 KINGS 3:17
25 Elisha left Bethel and went to Carmel Mountain, and after that he returned to
Samaria city.

The war between Israel and Moab
1 After Jehoshaphat had been ruling Judah for almost 18 years, Ahab’s son Joram
became the king of Israel. He ruled in Samaria city for twelve years.
2 He did things that Yahweh considered to be evil, but he did not do as much evil
as his father and mother had done, and he got rid of the pillar for worshiping Baal
which his father had made.
3 But he committed the sins that King Jeroboam had committed and which led the
Israeli people to sin, and he did not stop committing those sins.
4 Mesha, the king of Moab, raised sheep. Every year he was forced to give 100,000
lambs and the wool from 100,000 rams to the king of Israel, because his kingdom was
controlled by the king of Israel.
5 But after King Ahab died, Mesha rebelled against the king of Israel.
6 So King Joram left Samaria and gathered together all his soldiers.
7 Then he sent this message to Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah: “The king of Moab
has rebelled against me. So will your army join my army and fight against the army
Jehoshaphat replied, “Yes, we will help you. We are ready to do whatever you want
8 He asked, “On which road shall we march to attack them?”
we will all go south of the Dead Sea, and then turn north through the Edom Desert.”
9 So the king of Israel and his army went with the kings of Judah and Edom and
their armies. They marched for seven days. Then there was no water left for their
soldiers or for their animals that carried supplies.
10 The king of Israel exclaimed, “This is a terrible situation! It seems that Yahweh
will allow the three of us to be captured by the army of [MTY] Moab!”
11 Jehoshaphat said, “Is there a prophet here who can ask Yahweh for us what we
should do?”
One of Joram’s army officers said, “Elisha, the son of Shaphat, is here. He was
Elijah’s assistant.” [IDM]
12 Jehoshaphat said, “It will be good to ask him, because he speaks what Yahweh
tells him to say.”
So those three kings went to Elisha.
13 Elisha said to the king of Israel, “Why do you come to me [RHQ]? Go and ask
those prophets that your father and mother consulted!”
But Joram replied, “No, we want you to ask Yahweh, because it seems that Yahweh
is going to allow us three kings to be captured by the army of Moab.”
14 Elisha replied, “I serve Yahweh, the commander of the armies of angels in heaven.
As surely as he lives, if I did not respect Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not
even think about doing anything to help you.
15 But, bring a musician to me.”
So they did that. And when the musician played on his harp, the power of Yahweh
came on Elisha.
16 He said, “Yahweh says that he will cause this dry stream-bed to be full of water.
17 The result will be that your soldiers and your animals that carry supplies and
2 KINGS 4:5
18 That is not difficult for Yahweh to do. But he will do more than that. He will also
enable you to defeat the army of Moab.
19 You will conquer all their beautiful cities, cities that have high walls around them.
You must cut down all their fruit trees, stop water from flowing from their springs,
and ruin their fertile fields by covering them with rocks.”
20 The next morning, at the time when they offered the sacrifices of grain, they were
surprised to see water flowing from Edom and covering the ground.
21 When the people of Moab heard that the three kings had come with their armies
to fight against them, all the men who were able to fight in battles, from the youngest
men to the oldest ones, were summoned, and they ◄took their positions/prepared to
fight► at the southern border of their land.
22 But when they rose early the next morning, they saw that the water across from
them appeared to be as red as blood.
23 They exclaimed, “It is blood! The three enemy armies must have fought and
killed each other! So let’s go and take everything that they have left!”
24 But when they reached the area where the Israeli soldiers had set up their tents,
the Israelis attacked the soldiers from Moab and forced them to retreat. The Israeli
soldiers pursued the soldiers from Moab and killed many of them.
25 The Israelis also destroyed their cities. And whenever they passed fertile fields,
they threw rocks on those fields, until the fields were covered with rocks. They
stopped water from flowing from the springs and cut down the fruit trees. Finally,
with slings surrounded the city and attacked it.
him 700 men who fought with swords, and they tried to force a way through the
Israeli lines of soldiers to escape to get help from the king of Syria, but they were
unable to escape.
27 Then the king of Moab took his oldest son, who would have become the next
king, and killed him and offered him for a sacrifice to their god Chemosh, burning
him on top of the city wall. The Israeli soldiers were horrified, with the result that
they left that city and returned to their own country.

Elisha helped a poor widow
1 One day the widow of one of Yahweh’s prophets came to Elisha and cried out to
him, “My husband, who worked with you, is dead. You know that he revered Yahweh
very much. But now a man to whom he owed a lot of money has come to me. And
because I cannot pay back the money, he is threatening to take away my two sons to
be his slaves as payment for what I owe him!”
2 Elisha replied, “What can I do to help you? Tell me, what do you have in your
house?”
She replied, “We have only a container of olive oil; we have nothing else.”
3 Elisha said, “Go to your neighbors and borrow from them as many empty jars as
you can.
4 Then take the jars into your house with your sons. Shut the door. Then pour olive
oil from your container into the other jars. When each jar is full, set it aside and fill
another jar. Keep doing that until all the jars are full.”
5 So she did what Elisha told her to do. Her sons kept bringing jars to her, and she
kept filling them.
2 KINGS 4:6
532
2 KINGS 4:24
6 Soon all the jars were full. So she said to one of her sons, “Bring me another jar!”
But he replied, “There are no more jars!” And then the olive oil stopped flowing.
7 When she told Elijah what had happened, he said to her, “Now sell the jars of oil.
And with the money you get, pay what you owe, and there will be enough extra money
Elisha caused the son of the woman from Shunem to become alive again
There was a wealthy woman who lived
there with her husband. One day she invited Elisha to her house for a meal. Elisha
went there and from then on, every time Elisha was in Shunem, he went to their
house to eat a meal.
9 One day the woman said to her husband, “I am sure that this man who often
comes here is a prophet who brings messages from God.
10 I think we should make a small room for him on our flat roof, and put a bed, a
table, a chair, and a lamp in it. If we do that, whenever he comes here, he will have
11 One day Elisha returned to Shunem, and he went up to that room to rest.
the servant went and told her. When she came to the doorway of Elisha’s room,
she has done for us. Then ask her what we can do for her. Ask, ‘Do you want me to
Gehazi told her, and she replied, “No, he does not need to do that, because my family/
relatives are able to give me what I need.”
14 Later, Elisha asked Gehazi, “What do you think that we can do for that woman?”
He replied, “She does not have a son, and her husband is an old man. So maybe we
should ask Yahweh to enable her to have a son.”
15 Elisha told Gehazi, “Call her back again.” So Gehazi went and called her. And
when the woman returned, as she stood in the doorway,
16 Elisha said to her, “About this time next year you will be holding your infant son
in your arms.” But she protested, “O, sir, you are a prophet who brings messages
from God, so please do not deceive/lie to me by saying things like that!”
17 But a few months later, the woman became pregnant, and she gave birth to a son
at that time the following year, just like Elisha had predicted.
18 When the child was older, one day he went out to the fields to see his father, who
was working with the men who were harvesting grain.
19 Suddenly the boy exclaimed, “My head hurts! My head hurts a lot!”
His father said to one of the servants, “Carry him home to his mother!”
20 So the servant carried him home, and his mother held him on her lap. But at
noontime the boy died.
21 She carried him up the steps to the prophet’s room and laid him on the bed. She
left him there and went out and shut the door.
22 She then called out to her husband, saying, “Send to me one of the servants and
a donkey, so that I can ride on it quickly to the prophet, and then come back!” But
she did not tell her husband that their son had died.
23 Her husband called out to her and said, “Why do you want to go today? This is
not the day when we celebrate the Festival of the New Moon, and it is not a Sabbath
day!”
But she only replied, “Just do what I requested and everything will be all right.”
24 So she told the servant to put saddles on two donkeys, and as they left, she said,
“Hurry! Do not slow down unless t tell you to do that!”
8 One day Elisha went to Shunem town.
2 KINGS 4:25
533
2 KINGS 4:41
25 As they approached Carmel Mountain, where Elisha was, Elisha saw her in the
distance. He said to Gehazi, “Look, the woman from Shunem is coming!
26 Run to her, and ask her if everything is all right with her and her husband and
with her child!”
So Gehazi ran to her and asked her, but she did not tell Gehazi anything. She only
said, “Yes, everything is fine.”
27 But when she came to where Elisha was, she prostrated herself on the ground in
front of Elisha and took hold of his feet. Gehazi started to push her away, but Elisha
said, “◄Do not push her away/Leave her alone►! Something is troubling her very
much, but Yahweh has not told me what it is.”
28 Then she said to Elisha, “O, sir, I did not ask you to enable me to give birth to a
son [RHQ]. And I told you not to lie to me about that!” [RHQ]
to Gehazi, “Get ready to leave immediately. Take my staff/walking stick and go to her
lay the staff on the child’s face. If you do that, perhaps Yahweh will enable him to be
well.”
30 But the boy’s mother said, “Just as certain as Yahweh lives and you live, I will
not go home if you do not go with me.” So Elisha returned with her to her home.
31 Gehazi hurried quickly, and when he got to the woman’s home, he laid the staff/
walking stick on the child’s face, but the child did not move or say anything.
So Gehazi returned to meet Elisha along the road, and told him, “The child is still
dead.”
32 When Elisha reached the house, he saw that the boy was lying dead on his bed.
33 Elisha went into the room by himself and shut the door and prayed to Yahweh.
34 Then he lay down on the boy’s body, and put his mouth on the boy’s mouth, and
put his eyes on the boy’s eyes, and put his hands on the boy’s hands. Then the boy’s
body started to become warm!
35 Elisha got up and walked back and forth in the room several times. Then he
stretched his body on the boy’s body again. The boy sneezed seven times and opened
his eyes!
36 Then Elisha summoned Gehazi. He said, “Call the boy’s mother!” So Gehazi went
and called her, and when she came in, Elisha said, “Here, take your son!”
37 She gratefully prostrated herself at Elisha’s feet. Then she picked up her son and
carried him downstairs.
Elisha made some stew edible
38 Then Elisha returned to Gilgal. But at that time there was ◄a famine/very little
food► in that area. One day as the group of prophets was sitting in front of Elisha
listening to what he was teaching, he said to his servant, “Put a large pot on the stove
and make some stew for these men.”
39 One of the prophets went out to the fields to gather some vegetables. But he
gathered only some wild gourds and put them in his cloak and brought them back.
He shredded them and put them in the pot, but he did not know that the gourds were
poisonous.
40 He served the stew to the prophets, but after the men had eaten only a couple
bites, they cried out, “Elisha, there is something in the pot that will kill us!”
So they would not eat it.
41 Elisha said, “Bring me some flour.” They brought him some, and he threw it in
the pot and he said, “It is all right now. You can eat it.” And they ate it, and it did not
harm them.
2 KINGS 4:42
534
2 KINGS 5:12
Elisha multiplied food for the prophets
42 One day a man from Baal-Shalishah town brought to Elisha a sack of freshly cut
grain and 20 loaves of barley bread, made from the first grain that they harvested
that year.
Elisha said to his servant, “Give it to the group of prophets, so that they can eat it.”
43 But his servant exclaimed, “Do you think that we can feed 100 of us prophets
with only that much?” [RHQ]
But Elisha replied, “Give it to the prophets so that they can eat it, because Yahweh
says that there will be plenty for all of them, and there will be some left over!”
44 After his servant gave it to the prophets, they ate all that they wanted, and there
Naaman was healed of leprosy
1 A man named Naaman was the commander of the army of Syria.
Yahweh had
enabled him to win many victories/battles. He was a great warrior, and as a result
the king of Syria greatly respected him. But he had ◄leprosy/a dreaded skin disease►.
2 Some time previously, groups of soldiers/marauders from Syria had raided/attacked
the land of Israel, and they had captured a young girl and taken her to Syria. She
became a servant for Naaman’s wife.
3 One day, that girl said to her, “I wish that ◄my master/your husband► would
go to see the prophet in Samaria. That prophet would heal your husband from his
leprosy.”
4 Naaman’s wife told her husband what the girl from Israel had said, and Naaman
told that to the king.
5-6 The king said to him, “Okay, go and see the prophet. I will write a letter for you
to take to the king of Israel, saying that I sent you.” The king wrote in the letter, “I
am sending this letter with my army commander Naaman, who serves me faithfully.
I want you to heal him of his disease.” So Naaman, assuming/thinking that the king
of Israel was the prophet, took the letter and 750 pounds of silver, 150 pounds of gold,
and ten sets of clothing, to give to the king of Israel, and he went to Samaria, taking
along several servants.
7 When he arrived in Samaria, he gave the letter to the king of Israel. The king read
the letter. Then, being very dismayed, the king tore his clothes and said, “I am not
God [RHQ]! I am not able to enable people to live or to die [RHQ]! Why does the king
who wrote this letter request me to cure this man of his leprosy? I think that he is
just wanting to start a fight with me!”
8 But the prophet Elisha heard that the king of Israel had torn his robe and said
that. So he sent a message to the king, saying, “Why are you upset/frustrated [RHQ]?
Send Naaman to me, and he will find out that because I am a true prophet here in
Israel, I can help/heal him.”
9 So Naaman went with his horses and chariots to Elisha’s house and waited outside
the door.
10 But Elisha did not come to the door. Instead, he sent a messenger to Naaman, to
tell him, “Go to the Jordan River and wash yourself seven times in the river. Then
your skin will be restored/healed, and you will no longer have leprosy.”
11 But Naaman became very angry. He said, “I thought that surely he would wave
his hand over the leprosy, and pray to Yahweh his god, and heal me!
12 Surely the Abana River and the Pharpar River in Damascus in my own country
of Syria are [RHQ] better than any of the rivers in Israel! Why can I not wash in
2 KINGS 5:13
2 KINGS 5:26
those rivers and be healed?” [RHQ] So he turned and walked away with great anger/
13 But his servants came to him, and one of them said, “Sir, if that prophet had told
you to do something difficult, you would certainly [RHQ] have done it. So you should
certainly do what he says and wash in the Jordan River to be healed!” [RHQ]
14 So Naaman went down to the Jordan River and washed himself seven times,
as ◄the prophet/Elisha► told him to do. Then his skin was restored/healed, and it
became healthy/smooth, like the skin of a young child.
15 Then Naaman and those who were with him went back to talk to Elisha. They
anywhere else in the world, but there is a God here in Israel! So now please accept
16 But Elisha replied, “Just as certainly as Yahweh, the one whom I serve, lives, I
will not accept any gifts.” Naaman kept urging him to accept the gifts, but Elisha kept
refusing.
17 Then Naaman said, “Okay, but I have one request. This dirt here in Israel is holy,
so please allow me to take some dirt from this place and put it in sacks on two mules.
Then I will take it back home with me and make an altar on this dirt. From now on,
I will offer sacrifices to Yahweh on that altar. I will not offer sacrifices to any other
god.
18 However, when my master, the king, goes into the temple of the god Rimmon to
worship him/it there, and he is leaning on my arm, I hope/desire that Yahweh will
forgive me because I will have to bow down, too.”
19 Elisha replied, “Go home, and do not worry about that.” So Naaman and his
servants started to travel home.
Elisha cursed Gehazi for being greedy
20 But then Elisha’s servant Gehazi said to himself, “It is not good that my master
allowed this Syrian man to leave like this. He should have accepted his gifts. So just
as certainly as Yahweh lives, I will go and catch up with Naaman and get something
from him.”
21 So Gehazi hurried to catch up with Naaman. When Naaman saw Gehazi running
toward him, he stopped the chariot in which he was riding, jumped out, and went to
see what Gehazi wanted. He asked him, “Is everything all right?”
22 Gehazi replied, “Yes, but two young prophets from the hilly area where the
descendants of Ephraim live have just arrived. Elisha has sent me to tell you that
he would like 75 pounds of silver and two sets of clothing to give to them.”
23 Naaman replied, “Certainly! You can have 150 pounds of silver!” He urged
Gehazi to take it. He also gave him two sets of clothing. He tied up the silver in two
bags and gave them to two of his servants to carry back to Elisha.
24 But when they arrived at the hill where Elisha lived, Gehazi took the silver and
the clothes from Naaman’s servants and sent the servants back to Naaman. Then he
took those things into his house and hid them.
25 When he went to Elisha, Elisha asked him, “Where did you go, Gehazi?” Gehazi
replied, “I did not go anywhere.”
26 Elisha asked him, “Do you not realize that my spirit was there when Naaman got
out of his chariot to talk with you? This is certainly not [RHQ] the time to accept
gifts of money and clothes and olive groves and vineyards and sheep and oxen and
servants!
2 KINGS 5:27
536
2 KINGS 6:17
27 Because you have done this, you and your children and all your descendants,
forever, will have leprosy just like Naaman had!” And when Gehazi left the room, he
was a leper! His skin was as white as snow!
The axe head floated
1 One day a group of prophets said to Elisha, “Look, this place where we meet
together with you is very small.
2 Allow us to go to the Jordan River and cut down some trees to make logs to build
a new meeting place.” So Elisha said, “Okay, go.”
3 One of them said to Elisha, “Please come with us.” So Elisha replied, “Okay, I will
go with you.”
4 So they went together. When they reached the Jordan River, they cut down some
trees.
5 But while one of them was cutting down a tree, suddenly the axe head separated
from the handle and fell into the water. He cried out to Elisha, “O, Master, what shall
I do? The axe is not mine; I borrowed it!”
6 Elisha replied, “Where did it fall into the water?” After the man showed him the
place, Elisha cut off a stick, and threw it into the water, and caused the iron axe head
to float on top of the water.
7 Elisha said, “Take it out of the water.” So the man reached his hand down and
picked up the axe head.
Elisha tricked the army of Syria
8 Whenever the king of Syria prepared to send his army to fight against Israel, he
first consulted his officers, and then told them where they should set up their tents.
9 But each time, Elisha would send a message to warn the king of Israel, telling him
where the army of Syria was planning to attack them, saying, “Be sure that your army
does not go near that place, because the army of Syria has set up their tents there.”
10 So the king of Israel would send messengers to warn the people who lived in that
place, and the people would remain on guard. That happened several times.
11 The king of Syria was very upset/disturbed/angry about that. So he summoned
his army officers and said to them, “Obviously one of you is ◄betraying us/revealing
our plans► to the king of Israel. Which one of you is doing it?”
12 One of his officers answered, “Your Majesty, it is not one of us. Elisha the prophet
knows what we plan to do, and he tells the king of Israel everything. He even knows
what you say in your own bedroom!”
13 The king of Syria replied, “Go and find out where he is, and I will send some men
there to capture him.” Someone told him, “People say that he is in Dothan town north
of Samaria.”
14 So the king sent a large group of soldiers to Dothan with horses and chariots.
They arrived at night and surrounded the town.
15 Early the next morning, Elisha’s servant got up and went outside the house. He
saw the soldiers of Syria with their horses and chariots surrounding the town. So he
went inside the house and reported it to Elisha and exclaimed, “O, sir! What are we
going to do?”
16 Elisha replied, “Do not be afraid! Those who will be helping us will be more than
those who will be helping them!”
17 Then he prayed, “Yahweh, I request that you open my servant’s eyes in order
that he can see what is out there!” So Yahweh enabled the servant to look out and see
2 KINGS 6:18
537
2 KINGS 6:33
that surrounding the hill on which the town was built was a huge number of horses,
and chariots made of fire!
“Yahweh, cause all these soldiers to become blind!” Yahweh answered his prayer
19 Then Elisha went to them and said, “You are not on the right road; this is not the
for.” But he led them to Samaria, the capital of Israel!
20 As soon as they entered Samaria, Elisha prayed again, saying, “Yahweh, now
enable these soldiers to see correctly again!” So Yahweh enabled them to see correctly,
and they were surprised to see that they were inside Samaria city.
21 When the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, “Sir, shall I tell my soldiers
to kill them? Shall we kill all of them?”
22 Elisha replied, “No, you must not kill them. If your army captured many of
your enemies in a battle, you would certainly not [RHQ] kill them. Give these men
something to eat and drink, and then allow them to return to their king.”
23 So the king of Israel did that. He told his servants to provide a big feast for them.
And when they had eaten and drunk plenty, he sent them away. They returned to
the king of Syria and told him what had happened. So for a while after that, soldiers
from Syria stopped raiding/attacking towns in Israel.
The army of Syria surrounded Samaria
24 But some time later, Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, assembled his entire army, and
they went to Samaria and surrounded the city for a long time.
25 Because of that, after a while there was hardly any food left inside the city, with
the result that eventually a donkey’s head, which was usually worthless, cost eighty
pieces of silver, and ◄one cup/0.3 liter► of dove’s dung cost five pieces of silver.
26 One day when the king of Israel was walking on top of the city wall, a woman
cried out to him, “Your Majesty, help me!”
27 He replied, “If Yahweh will not help you, I certainly cannot [RHQ] help you. I
certainly [RHQ] do not have any wheat or wine!
28 What is your problem?” She replied, “Several days ago, that woman over there
said to me, ‘Because we have nothing left to eat, let’s kill your son today, in order that
we can eat his flesh. Then tomorrow we can kill my son and eat his flesh.’
29 So we killed my son and cut his body up and boiled his flesh and ate it. The next
day, I said to her, ‘Now give your son to me, in order that we can kill him and cook
his flesh and eat it.’ But she has hidden her son!”
30 When the king heard what the woman said, he tore his robe to show that he was
very distressed. The people who were standing close to the wall were able to see that
the king was wearing rough cloth underneath his robe because he was very distressed.
31 The king exclaimed, “I wish/hope that God will strike me dead if I do not cut off
the head of Elisha today, because he is the one who has caused these terrible things to
happen to us!”
32 So the king sent an officer to get Elisha.
Before the officer arrived, Elisha was sitting in his house with some Israeli elders
who were talking with him. Elisha said to them, “That murderer, the king of Israel, is
allow him to come in. And the king will be coming right behind that officer!”
“It is Yahweh who has caused us to have all this trouble/suffering. ◄Why should I
2 KINGS 7:1
538
2 KINGS 7:13
any longer for him to help us!►”
7
1 Elisha replied to the king, “Listen to what Yahweh says: ‘He says that by this time
tomorrow, at the marketplace here in Samaria, you will be able to buy ◄ten pounds/
five kg.► of fine wheat or ◄20 pounds/ten kg.► of barley for only one piece of silver.’ ”
2 The king’s officer said to Elijah, “That cannot happen! Even if Yahweh himself
would open the windows of the sky and send grain down to us, that certainly could not
[RHQ] happen!” Elisha replied, “Because you said that, you [SYN] will see it happen,
but you will not be able to eat any of the food!”
The Syrian army became frightened and left
3 That day there were four men who had ◄leprosy/a dreaded skin disease► who
were sitting outside the gate of Samaria city. They said to each other, “◄Why should
we wait here until we die?/It is ridiculous for us to wait here until we die.► [RHQ]
4 If we go into the city, we will die there, because there is no food there. If we
remain sitting here, we will die here. So let’s go to where the army of Syria has set
up their tents. If they kill us, we will die. But if they allow us to remain alive, we will
not die.”
5 So when it was getting dark, those four men went to the camp where the army
of Syria had set up their tents. But when they reached the camp, they saw that there
was no one there!
6 What had happened was that Yahweh had caused the army of Syria to hear
something that sounded like a large army marching with chariots and horses. So
they said to each other, “Listen! The king of Israel has hired the kings of Egypt and
the Heth people-group and their armies, and they have come to attack us!”
7 So they all ran away that evening and left their tents and their horses and donkeys
there, because they were afraid that they would be killed if they stayed there.
8 When those four lepers came to the edge of the area where the soldiers of Syria
had set up their tents, they went into one tent, and saw all the things that had been
left there. So they ate and drank what was there, and they took the silver and the gold
and clothes. Then they went outside the tent and hid those things. Then they entered
another tent, and took things from there, and then went outside and hid them, also.
9 But then they said to each other, “We are not doing what is right. We have good
news to tell others today. If we do not tell it to anyone now, and if we wait until
morning to tell it, we will certainly be punished by Yahweh. So let’s go right now to
the palace and tell it to the king’s officials!”
10 So they went to the guards at the city gates and called out to them, “We went to
where the army of Syria had set up their tents, but we did not see or hear anyone
there. Their horses and donkeys were still tied up, but their tents were all deserted/
abandoned!”
11 The guards shouted the news, and some people who heard it went to the palace
and reported it there.
12 When the king heard it, he got up out of his bed and said to his officials, “I will
tell you what the army of Syria is planning to do. They know that we have no food
here, so they have left their tents and are hiding in the fields. They think that we will
leave the city to find some food, and then they will capture us and capture the city.”
13 But one of his officials said, “Many of our Israeli people have already died from
◄hunger/not having anything to eat►. If those of us who are still alive all stay here,
2 KINGS 7:14
539
2 KINGS 8:6
we also will die anyway. So let’s send some men with five of our horses that are still
alive to go and see what has really happened.”
14 So they chose some men and told them to go in a chariot and find out what had
happened to the army of Syria.
15 They went as far as the Jordan River. All along the road they saw clothes and
equipment that the soldiers from Syria had thrown away while they were running
away very quickly. So the men returned to the king and reported what they had seen.
16 Then many of the people of Samaria also went out of the city and went to where
the army of Syria had previously set up their tents. They entered all the tents and
took everything. So there was now plenty of everything! As a result people could buy
ten pounds of fine wheat or 20 pounds of barley for only one piece of silver, which
was what Yahweh had said would happen!
17 The king of Israel had appointed the officer who was his assistant to supervise
what was happening at the marketplace. But as he was standing near the gate, all
the people who were rushing outside the city trampled on him, and he died, which
was what Elisha had said would happen to him when Elisha previously went to talk
to the king.
18 Elisha had told him that by the next day there would be plenty of food, with the
result that anyone could buy ten pounds of fine wheat or 20 pounds of barley for
only one piece of silver.
Yahweh himself would open the sky and send down some grain, that could not
happen.” And Elisha had replied, “Because you said that, you [SYN] will see it happen,
but you will not be able to eat any of the food!”
20 And that is what happened to him. The people who were rushing out of the city
gate trampled on him, and he died.
8
The widow from Shunem recovered her land
1 After Elisha caused the son of the woman from Shunem town to become alive
again, he told her that she should leave with her family and live somewhere else for
a while, because Yahweh was going to ◄send a famine/cause food to become very
scarce► in the land. He said that the famine would last for seven years.
2 So the woman did what Elisha told her to do. She and her family went to live in
the Philistia region for seven years.
3 After the seven years were ended, they returned to their home. The woman went
to the king to request that her house and her land be given back to her.
4 When she arrived, the king was talking with Gehazi, Elisha’s servant. The king
was saying to him, “Tell me all the great things that Elisha has done.”
5 While Gehazi was telling the king that Elisha had caused the son of a woman from
Shunem to become alive again, that woman came in and requested the king to enable
her to get her house and land back again. Gehazi exclaimed, “Your Majesty, this is
the woman whose son Elisha caused to become alive again!”
6 When the king asked her about it, she told him that what Gehazi had said was
true. The king summoned one of his officials and said to him, “I want everything
that this woman possessed previously, including the value of all the crops that have
be given back to her.” So the official did that.
2 KINGS 8:23
7 Elisha went to Damascus, the capital of Syria, when Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria,
was very sick. When someone told the king that Elisha was in Damascus,
8 the king told one of his officials named Hazael, “Go and talk to that prophet and
take a present/gift with you to give to him. Request him to ask Yahweh if I will recover
from my illness.”
9 So Hazael went to talk with Elisha. He took with him forty camels that were
carrying many kinds of goods that were produced in Damascus. When Hazael met
him, he said to him, “Your friend Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, sent me to ask you
whether you think he will recover from his illness.”
10 Elisha said to Hazael, “Go and say to him, ‘Yes, you will certainly not die from
this illness,’ but Yahweh has shown me that he will certainly die before he recovers.”
11 Then Elisha stared at him and had a terrified look on his face. That caused Hazael
to feel uneasy/embarrassed. Then suddenly Elisha started to cry.
12 Hazael said, “Sir, why are you crying?”
you will do to the people of Israel: You will burn their cities with walls around them,
children, and you will rip open the bellies of their pregnant women with a sword.”
13 Hazael replied, “I am as insignificant as [MET] a dog; ◄how could I do such
things?/I would never do such terrible things!►” [RHQ]
Elisha replied, “Yahweh has also revealed to me that you will become the king of
Syria.”
14 Then Hazael left and returned to his master/boss the king, who asked him, “What
did Elisha say?”
He replied, “He told me that you would certainly recover.”
15 But the next day, while the king was sleeping, Hazael took a blanket and soaked it
in water. Then he spread it on the king’s face in order that he could not breathe, and
he died. Then Hazael became the king of Syria instead of Ben-Hadad.
King Jehoram of Judah
16 After King Joram, the son of Ahab, had been ruling in Israel for almost five years,
Jehoshaphat’s son Jehoram became the king of Judah.
17 He was thirty-two years old when he became the king, and he ruled in Jerusalem
for eight years.
18 His wife was the daughter of King Ahab. And like everyone in Ahab’s family,
he continually did the evil things that the previous kings of Israel had done. He did
things that Yahweh considered to be evil.
19 But Yahweh did not want to get rid of the people of Judah, because of what he
had promised David, who served him very well. He had promised David that his
descendants [MET] would always rule Judah.
20 During the time that Jehoram ruled, the king of Edom rebelled against Judah, and
they appointed their own king.
21 So Jehoram went with his army and all their chariots to Zair city near the border
of Edom. There the army of Edom surrounded them. But during the night, Jehoram
and the commanders in their chariots were able to get through the enemy lines and
escaped. And all his soldiers also fled to their homes.
22 So after that, Edom was no longer controlled by Judah, and it is still like that.
controlled by Judah.

2 KINGS 9:11
24 Jehoram died [EUP] and was buried where the other kings of Judah had been
buried in the part of Jerusalem called ‘The City of David’. Then Jehoram’s son Ahaziah
King Ahaziah of Judah
Ahab’s son Joram has been ruling in Israel for almost twelve years,
Jehoram’s son Ahaziah became the king of Judah.
26 Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he started to rule. He ruled in Jerusalem
for only one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah, the daughter of King Ahab and
the granddaughter of King Omri of Israel.
27 King Ahab conducted his life just like the members of Ahab’s family had done.
He did things that Yahweh considered to be very evil.
28 Ahaziah’s army joined the army of King Joram of Israel to fight against the army
of King Hazael of Syria. Their armies started fighting at Ramoth city in the Gilead
region, and the soldiers of Syria wounded Joram.
29 King Joram returned to Jezreel city to recover from his wounds. King Ahaziah
went to visit him there.
25 After
9
Jehu became the king of Israel
1 Meanwhile, the prophet Elisha summoned one of the other prophets. He said to
him, “Get ready [IDM] and go to Ramoth city in the Gilead region. Take this jar of
olive oil with you.
2 When you arrive there, search for a man named Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat and
grandson of Nimshi. Go with him into a room away from his companions,
3 and pour some of this oil on his head. Then say to him, ‘Yahweh declares that
he is appointing you to be the king of Israel.’ Then open the door and run away as
quickly as you can.”
4 So the young prophet went to Ramoth.
5 When he arrived, he saw that the commanders of the army were having a
conference. He looked at Jehu and said, “Sir, I have a message for one of you.”
Jehu replied, “Which one of us is the message for?”
The young prophet replied, “It is for you, commander/sir.”
6 So Jehu got up and went with the young prophet into a house. There the young
prophet poured some olive oil on Jehu’s head and said to him, “Yahweh, the God
whom we Israelis worship, declares this: ‘I am appointing you to be the king of my
Israeli people.
7 You must kill your master King Joram, the son of Ahab, because I want to punish
Ahab’s wife Jezebel for murdering [MTY] many of my prophets and other people who
served me.
8 You must kill not only Joram but all of Ahab’s family. I want to get rid of every
9 I will get rid of Ahab’s family, like I got rid of the families of two other kings of
10 And when Jezebel dies, her corpse will not be buried. Dogs will eat her corpse
After the young prophet said this, he left the room and ran.
11 When Jehu came out of the room to where his other commanders were, they said
to him, “Is everything all right? Why did that mad fellow come to you?”
He replied, “You know what kinds of things young prophets like him say.”
2 KINGS 9:12
542
2 KINGS 9:25
12 They said, “You are lying! Tell us what he said!”
He replied, “He told me that Yahweh said, ‘I am appointing [MTY] you to be the
king of Israel.’ ”
13 Then they all spread their cloaks on the steps of the building for Jehu to walk out
on, and they blew trumpets and shouted, “Jehu is now the king!”
King Joram of Israel was killed
14-15 King Joram and his army had been defending Ramoth against the attacks by
the army of the king of Syria. King Joram had returned to Jezreel city, to recover
from being wounded in the battle against the army of Hazael, the king of Syria. And
Jehu made plans to kill Joram. He said to his other commanders, “If helping me is
truly what you want, make sure that no one leaves this city to go to warn the people
of Jezreel about what I am planning to do.”
16 Then Jehu and his officers got into their chariots and rode to Jezreel, where Joram
was still recovering. And King Ahaziah of Judah was there, visiting Joram.
17 A guard was standing in the watchtower in Jezreel. He saw Jehu and his men
approaching. He called out, “I see a lot of men who are approaching!” King Joram
heard what the watchman said, so he said to his soldiers, “Send someone on a horse
to go and find out if they are coming to be friendly to us or to attack us.”
18 So a man rode out to meet Jehu and said to him, “The king wants to know if you
are coming to be friendly to us.”
Jehu replied, “This is not the time for you [RHQ] to be concerned about acting
friendly! Turn around and come behind me!”
So the guard in the watchtower reported that the messenger had reached the group
that was approaching, but that he was not returning alone.
19 So King Joram sent another messenger, who asked Jehu the same question. Again
Jehu replied, “This is not the time [RHQ] for you to be concerned about acting friendly!
Turn around and follow me!”
20 Then the watchman reported again, “That messenger also reached them, but he
is not coming back alone. And the leader of the group must be Jehu, the son of Nimshi,
because he is driving his chariot furiously, like Jehu does!”
21 Joram said to his soldiers, “Get my chariot ready!” So they did that. Then King
Joram and King Ahaziah both rode toward Jehu, each one in his own chariot. And it
happened that they met Jehu at the field that had previously belonged to Naboth!
22 When Joram met Jehu, he said to him, “Are you coming on a peaceful visit?”
Jehu replied, “◄How can there be peace while you and your people are prostrating
themselves to worship idols and practicing very much <witchcraft/sorcery> like your
mother Jezebel did?/There certainly cannot be peace while you and your people are
prostrating themselves to worship idols and practicing <witchcraft/sorcery> like your
mother Jezebel has been doing!►” [RHQ]
23 Joram cried out, “Ahaziah, they have deceived us! They want to kill us!” So Joram
turned his chariot around and tried to flee.
his shoulder blades. The arrow went through his body and pierced his heart, and he
25 Then Jehu said to his assistant Bidkar, “Take his corpse and throw it here into
were riding together in chariots behind King Joram’s father Ahab, that Yahweh said
this about Ahab:
2 KINGS 9:26
543
2 KINGS 10:4
26 ‘Yesterday I saw Ahab murder [MTY] Naboth and his sons here. And I solemnly
and throw it into that field! That will fulfill what Yahweh said would happen.”
also!” So they shot him with arrows while he was riding in his chariot on the road up
to Gur, near Ibleam town. He continued going in his chariot until he reached Megiddo
city, where he died.
28 His officials took his corpse back to Jerusalem and buried it in the tombs in the
part of Jerusalem called ‘The City of David’, where his ancestors had been buried.
29 Ahaziah had become the king of Judah when Joram had been ruling Israel for
almost eleven years.
Queen Jezebel was killed
Jehu went to Jezreel. When Ahab’s widow Jezebel heard what had
happened, she put paint/makeup on her eyelids, and combed her hair to make it
beautiful, and looked out the window of the palace toward the street below.
31 While Jehu was entering the city gate, she called out to him, “You are like Zimri!
You are a murderer! I think you are certainly not [RHQ] coming on a peaceful visit!”
32 Jehu looked up toward the window, and then he said, “Who is ◄on my side/
wants to help me►? Anyone?” Two or three palace officials looked down at him from
a window and pointed to themselves.
33 Jehu said to them, “Throw her down here!”
So they threw her down, and when she hit the ground and died, some of her blood
splattered on the city wall and on the horses that were pulling the chariots.
34 Then Jehu went into the palace and ate and drank. Then he said to some of his
men, “Take the corpse of that women whom Yahweh has cursed and bury it, because
she is a king’s daughter and therefore should be buried properly.”
35 But when they went to get her corpse to bury it, all that was left was only her
skull and the bones of her feet and her hands. Everything else was gone.
36 When they reported this to Jehu, he said, “That is what Yahweh said would
happen! He told his servant/prophet Elijah, ‘In the city of Jezreel, dogs will eat the
flesh of Jezebel’s corpse.
37 Her bones will be scattered there in Jezreel like dung, with the result that no one
will be able to recognize them and say, “These are Jezebel’s bones.” ’ ”
30 Then
Ahab’s descendants were murdered
10
1 There were seventy descendants of King Ahab who were living there in Samaria.
Jehu wrote a letter and made copies of it and sent them to the rulers of the city, to
the elders, and to those who raised and tutored Ahab’s children.
2 This is what he wrote: “You are the ones who are taking care of the king’s
descendants. You have chariots and horses and weapons, and you live in cities that
have walls around them. So as soon as you receive this letter,
3 choose one of the king’s sons, the one who is the best qualified, and appoint him
to be your king. Then prepare to fight to defend him.”
4 But when they got those letters from Jehu and read them, they became very afraid.
They said, “King Joram and King Ahaziah could not resist him; ◄how can we resist
him?/we cannot possibly resist him!►” [RHQ]
2 KINGS 10:5
2 KINGS 10:19
5 So the officer who was in charge of the palace and the mayor of the city sent a
message to Jehu saying, “We want to serve you, and we are ready to do whatever you
tell us to do. We will not appoint anyone to become our king. You do whatever you
think is best.”
6 So Jehu sent a second letter to them, writing this: “If you ◄are on my side/want
to help me►, and if you are ready to obey me, kill King Ahab’s descendants and cut
off their heads and bring their heads to me here in Jezreel at this time tomorrow.”
The seventy descendants of King Ahab were being brought up and supervised by
the leaders of Samaria city.
7 When they received the letter from Jehu, they killed all seventy of Ahab’s
descendants and cut off their heads. They put their heads in baskets and sent them
to Jehu at Jezreel.
8 A messenger came to Jehu and told him, “They have brought the heads of Ahab’s
descendants.” So Jehu commanded that the heads should be put in two piles at the
city gate and that the heads should stay there until the next morning.
9 The next morning he went out to the city gate and said to all the people, “I am the
one who plotted against King Joram and killed him. You are not guilty of doing that.
But it was Yahweh, not I [RHQ] who commanded that all these descendants of Ahab
should be killed.
10 So you need to know that everything that Yahweh said would happen has
happened. He has caused to happen what he told the prophet Elijah would happen.”
11 Then Jehu executed all the other relatives of Ahab in Jezreel, and all Ahab’s
officers, and close friends, and his priests. He did not allow any of them to remain
alive.
12 Then Jehu left Jezreel and went toward Samaria. While he was going there, at a
place called ‘Shepherds’ Camp’,
13 he met some relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah. He asked them, “Who are you?”
They replied, “We are relatives of King Ahaziah. We are going to Jezreel to visit the
children of Queen Jezebel and the other members of King Joram’s family.”
the pit named Beth-Eked. There were 42 people whom they killed; they did not allow
any of them to remain alive.
15 Then Jehu continued to travel toward Samaria. Along the road, he was met by
Jonadab, a leader of the Rechab clan. Jehu greeted him and said to him, “Are you as
devoted to me [IDM] as I am devoted to you?”
Jonadab replied, “Yes, I am.”
Jehu said, “If you are, shake hands with me.” So Jonadab shook hands with him,
and Jehu helped him to get into his chariot.
16 Jehu said to him, “Come with me, and you will see that I am very devoted to
Yahweh.” So they rode together to Samaria.
17 When they arrived in Samaria, Jehu killed all of Ahab’s relatives who were still
alive. He did not ◄spare any of them/allow any of them to remain alive►. That was
what Yahweh told Elijah would happen.
The people who worshiped Baal were killed
18 Then Jehu summoned all the people of Samaria, and said to them, “King Ahab
19 So now summon all the prophets of Baal, all of Baal’s priests, and all the others
be there. Any of them who is not there will be executed.” But Jehu was planning to
2 KINGS 10:20
545
2 KINGS 10:36
20 Then Jehu commanded, “Announce that we are going to set aside a day to honor
Baal.” So they did that.
21 Jehu decided what day they would gather and sent messages throughout Israel
telling everyone what day to gather on, and on that day, everyone who worshiped
Baal came. No one stayed at home. They all went into the huge temple of Baal and
filled it from one end to the other.
22 Jehu told the priest who took care of the sacred robes to bring them out and give
them to the people who worshiped Baal. So the priest did that.
23 Then Jehu went into the temple of Baal with Jonadab, and he said to the people
who were there to worship Baal, “Be sure that only those who worship Baal are here.
Be sure that no one who worships Yahweh has come in.”
24 Then he and Jonadab prepared to offer sacrifices and other offerings to Baal that
would be completely burned on the altar that was there in Samaria. But Jehu had
stationed eighty of his men outside the temple, and had said to them, “I want you to
kill all the people who are in the temple. Anyone who allows one of them to escape
will be executed!”
25 As soon as Jehu and Jonadab had finished killing the animals that would be
completely burned to be an offering to Baal, they went outside and said to the guards
and officers, “Go in and kill all of them! Do not allow any of them to escape!” So the
guards and officers went in and killed them all with their swords. Then they dragged
their corpses outside the temple. Then they went into the inner room of the temple,
26 and they carried out the sacred pillar of Baal that was there, and they burned it.
27 So they destroyed that pillar that honored Baal, and then they burned down the
temple, and made it a public toilet. And it is still a toilet!
28 That is how Jehu got rid of the worship of Baal in Israel.
29 But Jehu did not quit committing the kinds of sins that Jeroboam had committed,
sins that led the people of Israel to sin by worshiping the gold statues of calves in
Bethel and Dan cities.
30 Then Yahweh said to Jehu, “You have done what pleased me by getting rid of
all of Ahab’s descendants. So I promise you that your son and grandson and greatgrandson and great-great-grandson will all be kings of Israel.”
31 But Jehu did not obey all the laws of Yahweh, the God of the Israeli people. He did
not stop committing the sins that Jeroboam had committed, sins that led the Israeli
people to sin.
Jehu died
32 At that time, Yahweh began to cause the territory controlled by Israel to become
smaller. The army of King Hazael of Syria conquered much of the Israeli territory.
33 He conquered the parts east of the Jordan River, as far south as Aroer town on
the Arnon River. That included the Gilead and Bashan regions, where the tribes of
Gad, Reuben, and half of the tribe of Manasseh lived.

Queen Athaliah of Judah
2 KINGS 11:1
546
2 KINGS 11:17
1 When King Ahaziah’s mother Athaliah saw that her son had been killed, she
commanded that all the members of Ahaziah’s family who might become king must
be executed.
2 So Ahaziah’s sons were all about to be murdered. But Jehosheba, who was King
Jehoram’s daughter and Ahaziah’s half-sister, took Ahaziah’s very young son Joash
and hid him and ◄his nursemaid/the woman who took care of him► in a bedroom
in the temple. So he was not killed.
3 He stayed with Jehosheba for six years. All during that time, he remained hidden
in the temple, while Athaliah ruled Judah.
4 But during the next year, Jehoiada the Supreme Priest summoned the officers who
supervised the royal bodyguards and the palace guards. He told them to come to the
temple. There he required them to solemnly promise that they would do what he
told them to do. And he showed King Ahaziah’s son Joash to them.
5 He gave them these instructions: “There are three groups of you guards. When
one group finishes their work on the Sabbath day, divide yourselves into three smaller
groups. One group must guard the palace.
6 Another group must guard at the Sur Gate. The other group must guard at the
gate behind the other groups.
7 The two groups that are not working on the Sabbath day must guard the temple
to protect little King Joash.
8 You must stand around the king wherever he goes, with your weapons in your
hands. You must kill anyone who comes near you.”
9 The officers who supervised the guards did what Jehoiada told them to do. Each
one brought to Jehoiada the guards that he supervised—the guards who were just
finishing their work and those who were about to start their work on the Sabbath
day.
10 The priest distributed to the commanders of the guards the spears and shields
that had belonged to King David, that were kept/stored in the temple.
11 Then he commanded all the guards to stand in their positions, each one with his
sword in his hand, all around the young king.
12 Then he brought Joash out. He put the crown on his head and gave him a scroll
on which were written the rules that the kings needed to obey. Then he poured some
olive oil on Joash’s head and proclaimed that he was now the king. The people all
clapped their hands and shouted, “We desire/hope that the king will live for many
years!”
13 When Athaliah heard the noise that was being made by the guards and the other
people, she ran to the temple, where the people were gathered.
14 She saw the new king standing there alongside one of the big pillars, which
was the place at the temple where the kings usually stood. She saw that he was
were shouting joyfully, and some of them were also blowing trumpets. She tore her
me!”
Yahweh! Take her away between two rows of guards. And kill anyone who tries to
rescue her!”
16 She tried to flee, but the guards seized her and took her to the palace, to the place
where horses enter the courtyard. They killed her there.
17 Then Jehoiada made a solemn agreement between the king and the people,
that they would always ◄obey/be faithful to► Yahweh. He also made an agreement
requiring the people to be loyal to Joash their king.
2 KINGS 11:18
547
2 KINGS 12:12
18 Then all the people of Israel who were there went to the temple of Baal and tore
it down. They smashed the altars and the statues of Baal. They also killed Mattan,
the priest of Baal, in front of the altars.
Jehoiada stationed/put guards at the temple of Yahweh.
19 Then he and the officers of the temple, the officers who supervised the royal
bodyguards, and the king’s bodyguards brought the king from the temple to the
palace. All the people followed them. Joash entered the palace at the Guard Gate
and sat down on the throne, which showed that he was the new king.
20 All the people of Judah rejoiced. And because Athaliah had been killed, the city
was quiet/calm.
21 Joash was seven years old when he became the king of Judah.
King Joash of Judah
12
1 When Jehu had been ruling Israel for almost seven years, Joash became the king
of Judah. He ruled in Jerusalem for 40 years. His mother was Zibiah, from Beersheba
city.
2 All his life, he did what pleased Yahweh, because Jehoiada the priest instructed/
taught him.
3 But the places where the people worshiped Yahweh on the tops of hills were not
destroyed, and they continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense at those places,
instead of at the place that God had chosen for them in Jerusalem.
4 Joash said to the priests, “You must take all the money which the people contribute,
both the money they are required to give and the money that they themselves decide
to give, as sacred offerings to buy things for the temple.
5 Each priest must take the money from people who know him (OR, from one of
the treasurers), and he must use that money to repair the temple whenever he sees
that there is something that needs to be repaired.”
6 But after Joash had been ruling for almost twenty-three years, the priests still had
7 So Joash summoned Jehoiada and the other priests and said to them, “◄Why are
you not repairing things in the temple?/You should have been repairing things in the
temple!► [RHQ] From now on, you must not keep the money that you receive from
be repairing things in the temple!”
not do the repair work.
9 Then Jehoiada took a chest and bored a hole in the lid. He placed it alongside the
altar for burning incense/sacrifices that was on the right as anyone enters the temple.
The priests who guarded the entrance to the temple put in the box the money that
was brought to the temple.
10 Whenever they saw that there was a lot of money in the chest, the king’s secretary
and the Supreme Priest would come and count the money. Then they would put it in
bags and tie the bags shut.
11 Then, after they weighed it, they would give the money to the men who
supervised the work in the temple. Then the supervisors would use that money to
pay the carpenters and builders who did the repair work in the temple,
12 and the masons and the stone cutters. Also with some of that money they bought
timber and stones that had been cut to be used in the repair work, and to pay all the
other expenses for the repair work.
2 KINGS 12:13
548
2 KINGS 13:9
13 But they did not use any of that money to pay men to make silver cups or wick
trimmers or bowls or trumpets or any other items made of silver or gold to be used
in the temple.
14 All that money was given to the men who were doing the work of repairing the
temple.
15 The men who supervised the work always did things honestly, so the king’s
secretary and the Supreme Priest never required that the supervisors report what
they had spent the money for.
16 But the money that people gave to pay for the wrong things that they had done
and the money they gave to purify themselves because of the sins that they had
committed was not put in the chest. That money belonged to the priests.
17 At that time, Hazael, the king of Syria, went with his army and attacked Gath city
and conquered it. Then he decided that they would attack Jerusalem.
18 So Joash, the king of Judah, took all the money that the previous kings,
Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, had dedicated to Yahweh. He added some of
his own money, and all the gold that was in the rooms in the temple where valuable
things were kept/stored, and the gold in his palace, and sent it all to King Hazael, to
◄appease him/persuade him to not attack Jerusalem►. So King Hazael took his army
away from Jerusalem.
19 If you want to read more of what Joash did, it is all written [RHQ] in the scroll
called ‘The History of the Kings of Judah’.
20-21 Joash’s officials plotted against him, and two of them killed Joash on the road
that goes down to the Silla district. The two men who did that were Jozabad, the son
of Shimeath, and Jehozabad, the son of Shomer. Joash was buried in the place where
his ancestors were buried, in the part of Jerusalem called ‘The City of David’. Then
Joash’s son Amaziah became the king of Judah.
2 He did many things that Yahweh considered to be evil and committed the same
kind of sins that Jeroboam had committed, sins which led the people of Israel to sin.
He did not stop committing those sins.
3 So Yahweh became very angry with the Israeli people, and he allowed the army
of King Hazael of Syria and his son Ben-Hadad to defeat the Israelis many times.
4 Then Jehoahaz prayed to Yahweh for help, and Yahweh heeded him, because he
saw that the army of the king of Syria was oppressing the Israelis.
5 Yahweh sent a leader to Israel, who enabled them to be freed from being controlled
by Syria. After that, the Israeli people lived peacefully as they had done previously.
6 But they still continued to commit the same kind of sins that Jeroboam and his
family had committed and which led the Israelis to also sin. And the statue of the
goddess Asherah remained in Samaria.
7 Jehoahaz had only 50 men who rode on horses and ten chariots and 10,000 other
soldiers, because the army of Syria had killed all the rest, trampling them like people
walk on dirt.
8 If you want to read about [RHQ] everything else that Jehoahaz did, you can read
about it in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Israel’.
9 Jehoahaz died [EUP] and was buried in Samaria. Then his son Jehoash became
the king.
2 KINGS 13:10
549
2 KINGS 13:25
King Jehoash ruled Israel
10 Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, started to rule in Israel after King Joash had been
ruling in Judah for 23 years. Jehoash ruled in Samaria for 17 years.
11 He did many things that Yahweh considered to be evil. He refused to turn away
from worshiping idols, which was the sin that many years earlier King Jeroboam had
told the Israeli people to commit.
12 The other things that happened while Jehoash was king and all the things that
he did are written in the book called ‘The Account of What the Kings of Israel Did’.
In that account they wrote about Jehoash’s army’s victories, and their war with the
army of King Amaziah of Judah.
13 When Jehoash died, he was buried in Samaria where the other kings of Israel
were buried. Then his son Jeroboam became king.
Elisha died
14 Elisha became very ill. Just before he died, King Jehoash went to Elisha and cried
in front of him. Saying the same words that Elisha had said when Elijah was taken
to heaven, he said, “My father/master! My father/master! The chariots of us Israeli
people and their drivers are taking my master away!”
15 Elisha said to him, “Bring to me a bow and some arrows!” So the king did that.
16 Then Elisha told the king to put his hands on the bow and prepare to shoot some
arrows. And then Elisha put his own hands on the king’s hands.
17 Then Elisha told him, “Have someone open that window toward the east.” So
they opened it. Then Elisha said, “Shoot!” So the king did. Then Elisha said, “That is
the arrow that indicates that your army will defeat the Syrian army. Your army will
18 Then Elisha said, “Pick up the other arrows and strike the ground with them!”
19 But Elisha was angry with him. He exclaimed, “You should have struck the
ground five or six times! If you had done that, your army would have defeated the
Syrian army until they were completely wiped out! But now, because you struck the
ground only three times, your army will defeat them only three times!”
20 Then Elisha died and was buried.
Groups of raiders from Moab came to Israel each year during ◄spring/the time
when the cold season was ending►.
21 One year, when some Israeli people were burying a man’s body, they saw a
group of those raiders. They were afraid, so quickly they threw that man’s body into
the tomb where Elisha had been buried, and they ran away.
But as soon as the man’s body touched Elisha’s bones, the dead man became alive
again and jumped up!
War between Israel and Syria
22 King Hazael of Syria sent soldiers to oppress the Israeli people all during the years
that Jehoahaz ruled Judah.
23 But Yahweh was very kind [DOU] to the Israeli people. He helped them because
of the agreement that he had made with their ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
He did not get rid of the Israelis, and he still has not rejected them.
24 When Hazael the king of Syria died, his son Ben-Hadad became the king.
25 The army of King Jehoash of Israel defeated the army of King Ben-Hadad three

King Amaziah of Judah
1 After Jehoash had been ruling Israel for almost two years, Joash’s son Amaziah
became the king of Judah.
2 He was 25 years old when he started to rule, and he ruled in Jerusalem for 29
years. His mother was Jehoaddin; she was from Jerusalem.
3 Amaziah did many things that pleased Yahweh, but he did not do as many things
that pleased Yahweh as King David had done. He did some of the good things that
his father Joash had done.
4 But, like his father, he did not tear down the places for worshipping Yahweh at
pagan shrines. The people continued to burn incense to honor Yahweh on those hills
instead of in Jerusalem, the place that Yahweh had appointed.
5 As soon as he was completely in control of his kingdom, he caused to be executed
the officials who had murdered his father.
that God gave to Moses: “Parents must not be executed for the crimes/sins committed
their parents. People must be executed only for the sins that they themselves have
7 Amaziah’s soldiers killed 10,000 soldiers of the Edom people-group in the Salt
Valley south of the Dead Sea, and they captured Sela city and gave it a new name,
Joktheel. That is still its name.
8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to King Jehoash of Israel, saying “Come here and
let’s talk together.”
9 But King Jehoash replied to King Amaziah: “Once a thornbush growing in the
mountains in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar tree, saying, ‘Give your daughter to
my son in order that he may marry her.’ But a wild animal in Lebanon passed by the
thornbush and trampled it.
10 The meaning of what I am saying is that your army has defeated the army of Edom,
so now you have become very proud. But you should be content with defeating the
people of Edom, and allow your soldiers to stay at home. If you cause trouble by
fighting against us, you will surely [RHQ] cause a disaster to happen to you and to
your people.”
11 But Amaziah refused to heed Jehoash’s message. So he marched with his army
to fight against the Israeli army at Beth-Shemesh city in Judah.
12 The Israeli army defeated the army of Judah, and all the soldiers of Judah fled
and ran back home.
13 Jehoash’s army also captured King Amaziah there, and they also marched to
Jerusalem and tore down the wall that was around the city, from the Ephraim Gate
to the Corner Gate. That was a section that was about ◄200 yards/180 meters► long.
14 Jehoash’s soldiers seized all the gold and silver that they found, and all the
utensils that were in the temple, and all the valuable things that were in the palace,
and took them to Samaria. They also took to Samaria some prisoners whom they had
captured.
15 If you want to know about all the other things that Jehoash did when he was king,
including when he and his army fought against the army of King Amaziah of Judah,
they are written in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Israel’.
16 Jehoash died [EUP], and he was buried in Samaria, where the other kings of Israel
had been buried. Then his son Jeroboam #2 became the king.
2 KINGS 14:17
551
2 KINGS 15:6
17 Amaziah, the king of Judah, lived for 15 more years after Jehoash, the king of
Israel, died.
18 If you want to know more about everything else that Amaziah did, it is written
[RHQ] in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Judah’.
19 Some people in Jerusalem plotted against Amaziah, so he fled to Lachish city. But
20 They took his corpse back to Jerusalem and buried it where his ancestors had
been buried, in the part of Jerusalem called ‘The City of David’.
21 Then all the people of Judah appointed Amaziah’s son Uzziah, when he was 16
years old, to be their king
22 After his father died, Uzziah’s workers captured Elath city, and it came under
the control of Judah again.
the king of Israel. He ruled in Samaria city for 41 years.
24 He did many things that Yahweh considered to be evil. He did not stop committing
the same kind of sins that Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, committed, sins which led the
Israeli people to sin also.
25 His soldiers conquered again some of the territory that had previously belonged
to Israel, from Hamath city in the north to the Dead Sea in the south. That is what
Yahweh, the God whom the Israelis worshiped, promised the prophet Jonah, the son
of Amittai, from Gath-Hepher town, would happen.
26 That happened because Yahweh saw that the Israelis’ enemies were causing the
Israelis to suffer very much. And there was absolutely no one [IDM] who would help
them.
27 But Yahweh said that he would not destroy Israel completely, so he enabled King
Jeroboam #2 to rescue them.
28 If you want to know more about everything else that Jeroboam #2 did, about his
fighting courageously in battles, and about his enabling the Israelis to capture again
Damascus and Hamath cities, they are written [RHQ] in the scroll called ‘The History
of the Kings of Israel’.
29 Jeroboam #2 died [EUP], and was buried where the other kings of Israel were
buried, and his son Zechariah became the king.
15
King Uzziah of Judah
1 After Jeroboam #2 had been ruling Israel for almost twenty-seven years, Uzziah,
the son of King Amaziah of Judah, began to rule.
2 He was 16 years old when he started to rule, and he ruled in Jerusalem for 52
years. His mother was Jecoliah, from Jerusalem.
3 He did things that Yahweh was pleased with, like his father Amaziah had done.
4 But, the places at the pagan shrines where they worshiped Yahweh were not
destroyed, and the people continued to burn incense to honor Yahweh at those places
instead of in Jerusalem, the place that Yahweh had appointed.
5 Yahweh caused Uzziah to become a leper, and he was a leper for the rest of his
life. He was not allowed to live in the palace. He lived alone in a house, and his son
Jotham ruled the country.
6 If you want to know about everything else that Uzziah did, it is written [RHQ] in
the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Judah’.
2 KINGS 15:7

2 KINGS 15:22
7 Uzziah died [EUP], and they buried him in the part of Jerusalem called ‘The City of
David’, where his ancestors had been buried. Then his son Jotham officially became
the king.
King Zechariah of Israel
8 After Uzziah had been ruling Judah for almost thirty-eight years, Zechariah, the
months.
He committed the same kind of sins that Jeroboam #1 had committed, sins which led
the Israeli people to sin.
10 Then Shallum, the son of Jabesh, made plans to assassinate Zechariah. He killed
him at Ibleam town, and then he became the king.
11 Everything else that Zechariah did is written in the scroll called ‘The History of
the Kings of Israel’.
12 When Zechariah died, that ended the dynasty of King Jehu. That fulfilled what
Yahweh said to King Jehu would happen: “Your son and grandson and great-grandson
and great-great-grandson will all be kings of Israel.”
King Shallum of Israel
13 Shallum, the son of Jabesh, became the king of Israel after King Uzziah had been
ruling Judah for almost thirty-nine years. But Shallum ruled in Samaria for only one
month.
14 Then Menahem, the son of Gadi, went up from Tirzah city to Samaria and
assassinated Shallum. Then Menahem became the king of Israel.
15 Everything else that Shallum did, including his killing King Zechariah, is written
in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Israel’.
16 While Menahem was ruling in Samaria, he completely destroyed Tappuah village
south of Samaria and killed all the people who lived there and in the surrounding
territory. He did that because the people in that city refused to surrender to him.
With his sword he even ripped open the bellies of pregnant women.
King Menahem of Israel
King Azariah had been ruling Judah for almost thirty-nine years,
Menahem, the son of Gadi, became the king of Israel. He ruled in Samaria for ten
years.
18 He did many things that Yahweh considered to be evil. He committed the same
kinds of sins that King Jeroboam #1 had committed, sins that led the people of Israel
to sin. He continued to commit those sins for the rest of his life.
19 Then King Tiglath-Pileser of Assyria came with his army to attack Israel. So
Menahem gave him ◄thirty-eight tons/35,000 kg.► of silver in order that TiglathPileser would help Menahem to continue to be king and rule his country more
strongly.
20 Menahem obtained that money from the rich men in Israel. He compelled each
of them to contribute 50 pieces of silver. So Tiglath-Pileser took that money and went
back home.
21 If you want to know more about everything that Menahem did, it is written [RHQ]
in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Israel’.

kind of sins that King Jeroboam #1 had committed, sins which led the people of Israel
to sin.
25 Then one of Pekahiah’s army commanders whose name was Pekah, the son
of Remaliah, planned with 50 men from the Gilead region to kill Pekahiah. They
assassinated him in a fortified place in the king’s palace in Samaria. Then Pekah
became the king.
26 Everything else that Pekahiah did is written in the scroll called ‘The History of
the Kings of Israel’.
King Pekah of Israel
27 When King Uzziah had been ruling Judah for almost 52 years, Pekah, the son of
Remaliah, became the king of Israel. He ruled in Samaria for 20 years.
28 He also did many things that Yahweh considered to be evil. He committed the
same kind of sins that King Jeroboam #1 had committed, sins that led the people of
Israel to sin.
29 While Pekah was the king, Tiglath-Pileser, the king of Assyria, came with his
army and captured the cities of Ijon, Abel-Beth-Maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, and
the regions of Gilead, Galilee, and Naphtali. His army forced the Israeli people to
leave their country and go to live in Assyria.
30 Then Hoshea, the son of Elah, plotted to kill Pekah. He assassinated him when
Uzziah’s son Jotham had been ruling Judah for almost 20 years. Then Hoshea became
the king of Israel.
31 Everything else that Pekah did is written in the scroll called ‘The History of the
Kings of Israel’.
King Jotham of Judah
32 When Pekah had been ruling Israel for almost two years, Uzziah’s son Jotham
began to rule Judah.
33 He was 25 years old when he started to rule, and he ruled from Jerusalem for 16
years. His mother was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.
34 He did many things that pleased Yahweh, like his father Uzziah had done.
35 But he did not destroy the places on the tops of hills where the people worshiped
Yahweh, and the people continued to burn incense there to honor Yahweh. Jotham’s
workers built the Upper Gate of the temple.
36 If you want to know more about everything else that Jotham did, it is written
[RHQ] in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Judah’.
37 It was during the time that Jotham was the king that Yahweh sent King Rezin of
Syria and King Pekah of Israel with their armies to attack Judah.
38 Jotham died [EUP] and was buried where his ancestors had been buried in the
part of Jerusalem called ‘The City of David’. Then his son Ahaz became the king of
Judah.
16
King Ahaz of Judah
1 When Pekah had been ruling Israel for almost 17 years, Ahaz, the son of Jotham,
became the king of Judah.
2 KINGS 16:2
554
2 KINGS 16:18
2 He was 20 years old when he became the king of Judah. He ruled from Jerusalem
for 16 years. He did not do things that pleased Yahweh his God, good things like his
ancestor King David had done.
3 Instead, he was as sinful as the kings of Israel had been. He even sacrificed his son
as an offering to idols. That was worse than the disgusting things that the people who
previously lived there had done, people whom Yahweh had expelled as the Israelis
were advancing through the land.
4 Ahaz offered sacrifices and burned incense to honor Yahweh on the tops of
many hills and under many [HYP] big trees, instead of in Jerusalem as Yahweh had
commanded.
5 While he was the king of Judah, King Rezin of Assyria and King Pekah of Israel
came with their armies and attacked Jerusalem. They surrounded the city, but they
could not conquer it.
6 At that time the army of the king of Edom expelled the people of Judah who were
living in Elath city. Some of the people of Edom started to live there, and they are
still living there.
7 King Ahaz sent messengers to King Tiglath-Pileser of Assyria, to tell this message
to him: “I promise that I will completely do what you tell me to do, as though I was
your son. Please come and rescue us from the armies of Syria and Israel who are
attacking my country.”
8 Ahaz took the silver and gold that was in the palace and in the temple and sent it
to Assyria to be a present/gift for the king of Assyria.
9 So Tiglath-Pileser did what Ahaz requested. His army marched to Damascus and
captured it, and they took the people of Damascus as prisoners to live in the capital
city of Assyria, and executed King Rezin.
10 When King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet King Tiglath-Pileser, he saw the altar
that was there. So he sent to Uriah, the Supreme Priest in Jerusalem, a drawing of the
altar and a model that was exactly like the altar in Damascus.
11 So Uriah built an altar in Jerusalem, following the drawing that King Ahaz had
sent. Uriah finished the altar before Ahaz returned to Jerusalem from Damascus.
13 and burned animal sacrifices and a grain offering on it. He also poured a wine
God.
the new altar and the temple, so Ahaz moved it to the north side of his new altar,
which was bigger than the old altar.
15 Then King Ahaz ordered Uriah: “Each morning put on this new altar the sacrifices
that will be completely burned, and in the evening put on it the grain offering, along
with my offering and the offerings that the people bring, ones that will be completely
burned, and my grain offering and the people’s grain and wine offerings. Pour against
the sides of the altar the blood of all the animals that are sacrificed. But the old bronze
altar will be only for me to use to find out what Yahweh wants me to do.”
16 So Uriah did what the king commanded him to do.
17 King Ahaz told his workers to take off the frames of the carts that were outside
the temple and to take down the basins that were on them. They also took down the
bronze tank from the backs of the bronze statues of the oxen and put it on a stone
foundation.
18 Then to please the king of Assyria, Ahaz had them remove from the temple the
roof under which the people walked into the temple on the Sabbath Day, and closed
up the private entrance into the temple for the kings of Judah.

David’, where his ancestors had been buried. Then his son Hezekiah became the
king.

years. Hoshea ruled in Samaria for nine years.
2 He did many things that Yahweh considered to be evil, but he did not do as many
evil things as the previous kings of Israel had done.
3 The army of King Shalmaneser of Assyria attacked and defeated the army of King
Hoshea. As a result, the Israelis were forced to pay a lot of tribute/taxes to Assyria
each year.
4 But several years later, Hoshea secretly planned to rebel against the rulers of
Assyria. He sent messengers to So/Osorkon, the king of Egypt, asking if his army
could help the Israelis fight against the army of Assyria. Hoshea also stopped paying
the tribute/taxes that he had been paying to Assyria every year. But the king of Assyria
found out about those things, so he told his officers to put Hoshea in prison.
5 Then he brought the army of Assyria to Israel, and they attacked everywhere in
that land. His army surrounded Samaria city for three years.
6 Finally, after King Hoshea had been ruling Israel for nine years, the army of
people to Assyria and forced some of them to live in Halah town. They forced others
to live near the Habor River in Gozan district. They forced others to live in the towns
where the Mede people-group lived.
The reason that the Israelis were defeated
7 Those things happened because the Israeli people had sinned against Yahweh their
God. He had rescued their ancestors from the power [MTY] of the king of Egypt and
brought them safely out of Egypt, but later they began to worship other gods.
8 They imitated the things that the heathen/pagan people-groups did. Those were
the groups that Yahweh had expelled as the Israelis occupied their land. The Israeli
people also did the evil things that the kings of Israel ◄introduced/showed to them►.
9 The Israeli people also secretly did many things that were not pleasing to Yahweh
their God. They built shrines to worship idols in all their cities, including small towns
10 They set up stone pillars to honor gods, and poles to worship the goddess Asherah
11 The Israelis burned incense in every place where they worshiped those gods, just
had expelled from the land. The Israelis did many wicked things that caused Yahweh
to become angry.
12 Yahweh warned them many times that they should not worship idols, but they
did it anyway.
13 Yahweh frequently sent his prophets and ◄seers/those who saw visions from
Yahweh► to warn the people of Israel and the people of Judah. The message that
Yahweh gave them was, “Turn away from all your evil behavior. Obey my commands
2 KINGS 17:14
556
2 KINGS 17:27
and my laws, the laws that I told your ancestors to obey and which I told the prophets
who served me to tell to you again.”
14 But the Israeli people would not pay attention. They were stubborn [IDM] just
like their ancestors were. Just like their ancestors did, they refused to believe in
Yahweh their God.
15 They rejected Yahweh’s laws and the agreement that he had made with their
ancestors. They ignored Yahweh’s warnings. They worshiped worthless idols and
as a result they themselves became worthless. Although Yahweh had commanded
them not to imitate the evil behavior of the people-groups that lived near them, they
disobeyed that command.
16 The Israeli people disobeyed all of Yahweh’s commands. They made two metal
calves to worship. They set up two poles to worship the goddess Asherah, and they
worshiped the god Baal, and the sun, the moon, and the stars.
17 They also burned their own sons and daughters to be sacrifices to those gods.
They went to fortune-tellers and they practiced sorcery. They continually chose [MET]
to do all kinds of evil things that caused Yahweh to become angry.
18 So, because Yahweh was very angry with the Israeli people, he allowed their
enemies to take them away from their country. Only the people of the tribe of Judah
were left in the land.
19 But even the people of Judah did not obey the commands of Yahweh their God.
They imitated the evil customs that the Israelis had introduced.
20 So Yahweh rejected all the people of Israel and of Judah. He punished them by
allowing the armies of other nations to defeat them and take them away. He got rid
of all of them.
21 Earlier, when Yahweh allowed the people of Israel to separate/break away from
the area [MTY] that King David had estabished, they chose Jeroboam, the son of Nebat,
to be their king. Then Jeroboam enticed the people of Israel to stop worshiping
Yahweh and to worship idols instead. He led them to commit great sins.
22 And the Israeli people continued to do the evil things that Jeroboam introduced.
They did not turn away from those sins,
23 until finally Yahweh got rid of them. That was just what his prophets had warned
would happen. The Israeli people were taken away to the land of Assyria, and they
still remain there.
Other groups settled in Israel
24 The king of Assyria ordered his soldiers to take groups of people from Babylon,
Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim cities to the Samaria region, and to resettle
them in the towns there, to take the place of the Israelis who lived there previously.
Those people took control over the whole Samaria region and lived in the towns there.
they first arrived in Samaria. So Yahweh sent lions to kill some of them.
who have resettled in the towns in Samaria do not know how to worship the God that
the Israelis worshiped in this land. So he has sent lions among us to kill us, because
we have not worshiped him correctly.”
27 When the king of Assyria read this letter, he commanded his officers, “You brought
many priests here from Samaria. Send one of them back there. Tell him to teach the
people who are now living there how to worship correctly the God whom the Israelis
worshiped in that land.”
2 KINGS 17:28
557
2 KINGS 18:4
28 So the officers did that. They sent one of the Israeli priests back to Samaria. That
priest went to live in Bethel city, and he taught the people there how to worship
Yahweh.
29 But the people who returned from Babylon and started to live in Samaria and
continued to make their own idols. They placed them in the shrines that the Israelis
had built there. The people of each people-group made idols in the cities in which
they were living.
30 The people from Babylon made idols to represent their god Succoth-Benoth. The
people from Cuthah made idols to represent their god Nergal. The people from
Hamath made idols to represent their god Ashima.
31 The people of Avva made idols to represent their gods Nibhaz and Tartak. The
people from Sepharvaim sacrificed their own children. They completely burned them
in pits where hot fires were kept burning, as offerings to their gods Adrammelech and
Anammelech.
32 But those people also worshiped Yahweh, and they appointed from among their
own groups many people to be priests at the shrines on the tops of the hills, in order
that those priests could offer sacrifices for them there.
33 So they revered Yahweh, but they also worshiped their own gods, just as the
people living in the countries from which they had been taken to Samaria did.
34 They still keep their old customs. They really do not worship Yahweh, and they
do not obey all the laws and commands that Yahweh gave to the descendants of Jacob,
to whom he gave the new name Israel.
35 Yahweh had previously made an agreement with their ancestors, commanding
them not to worship other gods or bow down to honor them or do other things to
please them or offer sacrifices to them.
36 He had said to them, “You must have an awesome respect for me, Yahweh, the
one who brought you out of Egypt with my very great power [DOU]. I am the one
whom you must bow down to honor, and I am the one to whom you must offer
sacrifices.
37 You must always obey the laws and commands that I told Moses to write for you.
You must not worship other gods.
38 And you must not forget the agreement that I made with your ancestors. You
must not revere other gods.
39 Instead, you must revere me, Yahweh, your God. If you do that, I will rescue you
from the power [MTY] of all your enemies.”
40 But the people from those foreign nations would not heed what Yahweh said.
Instead, they continued to adhere to their old customs.
41 So, they worshiped Yahweh, but they also worshiped their idols. And their
King Hezekiah started to rule Judah
18
1 After King Hoshea had been ruling Israel for almost three years, Hezekiah, the
son of Ahaz, began to rule Judah.
2 He was 25 years old when he became the king of Judah and he ruled from
Jerusalem for 29 years. His mother was Abijah, the daughter of a man whose name
was Zechariah.
3 Hezekiah did things that Yahweh considered to be right, like his ancestor King
David had done.
4 He destroyed the places where people worshiped Yahweh on the tops of hills, and
he broke into pieces the stone pillars for worshiping the goddess Asherah. He also
2 KINGS 18:5
558
2 KINGS 18:18
broke into pieces the bronze replica/statue of a snake that Moses had made. He did
that because the people had named it Nehushtan, and they were burning incense in
front of it to honor it.
5 Hezekiah trusted in Yahweh, the God whom the Israelis worshiped. There was no
king who ruled Judah before him or after him who was as devoted to Yahweh as he
was.
6 He remained loyal to Yahweh and never disobeyed him. He carefully obeyed all
the commandments that Yahweh had given to Moses.
7 Yahweh always ◄helped/was with► him. He was successful in everything that he
did. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and refused to ◄pay taxes to him/do what
the king of Assyria wanted him to do►.
8 His army defeated the soldiers of Philistia as far south as Gaza city and the nearby
villages. They conquered the entire area, from the smallest watchtower to the largest
cities surrounded by walls.
9 After King Hezekiah had been ruling Judah for almost four years, and when King
Hoshea had been ruling Israel for almost seven years, the army of King Shalmaneser
of Assyria invaded Israel and surrounded Samaria city.
10 In the third year they captured the city. That was when Hezekiah has been ruling
Judah for almost six years, and when Hoshea had been ruling Israel for almost nine
years.
11 The king of Assyria commanded that the people of Israel be taken to Assyria.
Some of them were taken to Halah town, some were taken to a place near the Habor
River in the Gozan region, and some were taken to cities where the Mede people-group
live.
12 That happened because the Israelis did not obey Yahweh their God.
They
disobeyed the agreement that Yahweh had made with their ancestors, and all the
laws that Moses, the man who served Yahweh very well, had told them to obey. They
would not obey those laws; they would not even listen to them.
The army of Assyria invaded Judah
13 After King Hezekiah had been ruling Judah for almost 14 years, the army of King
Sennacherib of Assyria attacked all the cities in Judah that had walls around them.
They did not capture Jerusalem, but they captured all the other cities.
14 King Hezekiah sent a message to Sennacherib, while Sennacherib was in Lachish,
saying “What I have done was wrong. Please tell your soldiers to stop attacking us.
If you do that, I will pay you whatever you tell me to.” So the king of Assyria said
that Hezekiah must pay to him ◄ten tons/9,000 kg.► of silver and ◄one ton/900 kg.►
of gold.
15 So Hezekiah gave to him all the silver that was in the temple and that was stored
in the king’s palace.
Sennacherib threatened to destroy Jerusalem
16 Hezekiah’s men also stripped the gold from the doors of the temple and the gold
that he himself had put on the doorposts, and he sent all that gold to the king of
Assyria.
17 But the king of Assyria sent a large army with some of his important officials from
Lachish city to persuade King Hezekiah to surrender. When they arrived at Jerusalem,
they stood alongside the aqueduct/channel in which water flows from the upper pool
into Jerusalem, near the road to the field where the women wash clothes.
18 They sent a message requesting King Hezekiah to come to them, but the king sent
three of his officials to talk to them. He sent Hilkiah’s son Eliakim, who supervised
2 KINGS 18:19
559
2 KINGS 18:32
the palace; Shebna, the official secretary; and Asaph’s son Joah, who communicated
19 One of Sennacherib’s important officials told them to take this message to
“This is what the king of Assyria, the great king, says: ‘What are you trusting in to
rescue you [RHQ]?
20 You say that you have weapons to fight us, and some country promises to help
you, and that will enable you to defeat us, but that is only talk [RHQ]. Who do you
think will help you to rebel against my soldiers from Assyria?
21 Listen to me! You are relying on the army of Egypt. But that is like [MET] using
a broken reed for a walking stick on which you could lean. But it would pierce the
hand of anyone who would lean on it! That is what the king of Egypt would be like
for anyone who relied on him for help.
22 But perhaps you will say to me, “No, we are ◄relying on/trusting in► Yahweh
our God to help us.” I would reply, “Is he not the one whom you insulted by tearing
down his shrines and altars and forcing everyone in Jerusalem and other places in
Judah to worship only in front of the altar in Jerusalem?” ’
23 So I suggest that you make a deal between you and my master/boss, the king of
Assyria. I will give you 2,000 horses, but I do not think that you are able to find 2,000
of your men who can ride on them!
24 You are expecting the king of Egypt to send chariots and men riding horses to
assist you. But they certainly would not [RHQ] be able to resist/defeat even the most
insignificant/unimportant official in the army of Assyria!
25 Furthermore, ◄do you think that we have come to destroy Jerusalem without
Yahweh’s help?/do not think that we have come to Jerusalem without Yahweh’s help.►
[RHQ] It is Yahweh himself who told us to come here and destroy this land!”
26 Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to the official from Assyria, “Sir, please speak
to us in your Aramaic language, because we understand it. Do not speak to us in our
Hebrew language, because the people who are standing on the wall will understand
it and be frightened.”
27 But the official replied, “Do you think [RHQ] that my master sent me to say these
things only to you and not to the people who are standing on the wall? If you reject
this message, the people in this city will soon need to eat their own dung and drink
their own urine, just like you will, because there will be nothing more for you to eat
or drink.”
28 Then the official stood up and shouted in the Hebrew language to the people
sitting on the wall. He said, “Listen to this message from the great king, the king of
Assyria. He says,
29 ‘Do not allow Hezekiah to deceive you. He will not be able to rescue you from
my power [MTY].
30 Do not allow him to persuade you to rely on Yahweh, saying that Yahweh will
rescue you, and that the army of Assyria will never capture this city!’
31 “Do not pay attention to what Hezekiah says! This is what the king of Assyria
says: ‘Come out of the city and surrender to me. If you do that, I will arrange for
each of you to drink the juice from your own grapevines, and to eat figs from your
own trees, and to drink water from your own wells.
32 You will be able to do that until we come and take you to a land that is like your
land—a land where there is grain to make bread and vineyards to produce grapes for
making wine. It will be a land that has plenty of olive trees and honey. If you do
what the king of Assyria commands, you will not die. You will continue to live.
2 KINGS 18:33
560
2 KINGS 19:10
‘Do not allow Hezekiah to persuade you to trust in Yahweh saying that he will
rescue you!
33 The gods that people of other nations worship have never rescued them from the
34 Why were the gods of Hamath and Arpad cities unable to rescue their people
and Ivvah, towns that we completely destroyed and their gods disappeared [RHQ]? Did
any god rescue Samaria from my power?
35 No, none of the gods of the countries that my army attacked rescued their people
[RHQ] from me! So why do you think that Yahweh will rescue you people of Jerusalem
from my power [MTY]?’ ”
36 But the people who were listening stayed silent. No one said anything, because
King Hezekiah had told them, “When the official from Assyria talks to you, do not
answer him.”
37 Then Eliakim the palace administrator and Shebna the court secretary and Joah
the royal historian went back to Hezekiah with their clothes torn because they were
extremely distressed, and they told him what the official from Assyria had said.
19
Hezekiah consulted the prophet Isaiah
1 When King Hezekiah heard what they reported, he tore his clothes and put on
temple to ask God what to do.
2 He summoned Eliakim and Shebna and the ◄older/most important► priests, who
were also wearing clothes made of rough sackcloth, and told them to talk to me.
3 He said to them, “Tell this to Isaiah: ‘King Hezekiah says that we are having great
distress/trouble now. Other nations are causing us to be insulted and disgraced. We
are like [MET] a woman who is about to give birth to a child, but she does not have
the strength that she needs to do it.
4 Perhaps Yahweh your God has heard everything that the official from Assyria
said. Perhaps he knows that his boss/master, the king of Assyria, sent him to insult
the all-powerful God, and that Yahweh will rebuke/punish him for what he said.’ And
he requests that you pray for the few of us who are still alive here in Jerusalem.”
5 When the messengers from Hezekiah came to Isaiah,
6 Isaiah said to them, “Go back to your boss/master and tell him, ‘This is what
Yahweh says: Those messengers from the king of Assyria have said evil things about
me. But you should not be disturbed because of what they said.
7 Listen to this: I will cause Sennacherib to hear a rumor that will worry him, that
and there I will cause him to be assassinated by men using swords.’ ”
8 The official from Assyria found out that the King of Assyria and his army had
left Lachish city, and that they were attacking Libnah, which is a nearby city. So the
official went there to report to him what had happened in Jerusalem.
9 Soon after that, King Sennacherib received a report that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia
was leading his army, and was coming to attack them. So before King Sennacherib
left Libnah to fight against the army from Ethiopia, he sent other messengers to King
Hezekiah with a letter.
10 In the letter he wrote this to Hezekiah: “Do not allow your god on whom you are
relying to deceive you by promising that the city of Jerusalem will not be captured by
my army [MTY].
2 KINGS 19:11
561
2 KINGS 19:24
11 You have certainly heard what the armies of the kings of Assyria have done to all
the other countries. Our armies have completely destroyed them. So, ◄do you think
12 Did the gods of the nations that were about to be destroyed by the armies of the
region and in Haran and Rezeph cities in northern Syria and the people of Eden who
had been ◄deported/forced to go► to Tel-Assar city? None of the gods of those cities
were able to rescue them.
13 What happened to the kings of Hamath and Arpad and Sepharvaim and Ivvah
cities [RHQ]? Most of them are dead, and the other people were deported!”
Hezekiah prayed
14 Hezekiah took the letter that the messengers gave him, and he read it. Then he
went up to the temple and spread out the letter in front of Yahweh.
15 Then Hezekiah prayed, “Yahweh, the God whom to whom we Israelis belong, you
are seated on your throne above the statues of creatures with wings, above the Sacred
Chest. Only you are truly God. You rule all the kingdoms on this earth. You are the
one who created everything on the earth and in the sky.
16 So, Yahweh, please listen to what I am saying, and look at what is happening. And
listen to what King Sennacherib has said to insult you, the all-powerful God.
17 “Yahweh, it is true that the armies of the kings of Assyria have completely
destroyed many nations, and ruined their land.
18 And they have thrown the idols of those nations into fires and burned them. But
that was not difficult to do, because they were not gods. They were only statues made
of wood and stone, idols that were shaped by humans, and that is why they were
destroyed easily.
19 So now, Yahweh our God, please rescue us from the power [MTY] of the king of
Assyria, in order that the people in all the kingdoms of the world will know that you,
Yahweh, are the only one who is truly God.”
Isaiah predicted that the Assyrians would not conquer Jerusalem
“This is what Yahweh, the God
to whom we Israelis belong, says: 'I have heard what you prayed to me about
Sennacherib, the king of Assyria.
21 This is what I say to him:
They wag/shake their heads to mock you while you flee from here.
Who do you think you were shouting at?
It was I, the holy God whom the Israelis worship.
23 The messengers that you sent made fun of me.
You said, 'With my many chariots I have gone to the highest mountains,
even to the highest mountains in Lebanon.
We have cut down its tallest cedar trees
and its nicest pine/cyprus trees.
We have been to the most distant/remote peaks
and to its dense forests.
24 We have dug wells in other countries and drank water from them.
And by marching through [MTY] the streams of Egypt,
we dried them all up [HYP]!” ’
20 Then Isaiah sent this message to Hezekiah:
2 KINGS 19:25
562
2 KINGS 19:34
25 ‘But I reply, “Have you never heard that long ago I determined that those things
would happen?
I planned it long ago,
and now I have been causing it to happen.
I planned that your army would have the power to capture many cities that were
surrounded by high walls,
and cause them to become piles of rubble.
26 The people who lived in those cities have no power,
and as a result they became dismayed and discouraged.
They are as frail as plants and grass in the fields,
as frail as grass that grows on the roofs of houses
and is scorched by the hot east wind.
27 “But I know everything about you.
I know when you are in your house and when you go outside;
I also know that you are ◄raging/speaking very angrily► against me.
28 So, because you have raged against me,
and because I have heard [MTY] you speak very proudly/arrogantly,
it will be as though I will put a hook in your nose
and an iron ◄bit/piece of metal► in your mouth in order that I can lead you where
I want you to go,
and I will force you to return to your own country
on the same road on which you came here, without conquering Jerusalem.” '
29 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “This is what will happen to prove that I am telling
the truth:
This year and next year you and your people will be able to harvest only ◄wild
grain/grain that grows without having been planted►.
But the following year, you Israelis will be able to plant grain and harvest it, and
to plant vineyards and eat the grapes that you harvest.
children; they will be like plants whose roots go deep down into the ground and
which produce much [MET].
31 There will be many people in Jerusalem [DOU] who will survive, because Yahweh,
the commander of the armies of angels in heaven, wants [PRS] it to happen.
32 So this is what Yahweh, says about the king of Assyria:
‘His armies will not enter this city;
they will not even shoot any arrows into it!
His soldiers will not march outside the city gates carrying shields,
and they will not even build high mounds of dirt against the city walls
to enable them to attack the city.
33 Their king will return to his own country
on the same road on which he came here.
He will not enter this city!
That will happen because I, Yahweh have said it!
34 I will defend this city and prevent it from being destroyed.
I will do this for the sake of my own reputation and because of what I promised
to King David, who served me well.' ”
2 KINGS 19:35
563
2 KINGS 20:13
35 That night, an angel from Yahweh went out to where the army of Assyria had
put up their tents, and killed 185,000 of their soldiers! When the rest of their soldiers
woke up the next morning, they saw that there were corpses everywhere!
36 Then King Sennacherib left and went home to Nineveh, the capital of Assyria.
37 One day, when he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, two of his
sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, killed him with their swords. Then they escaped
and went to the Ararat region, northwest of Nineveh. And another of Sennacherib's
sons, Esarhaddon, became the king of Assyria.
20
Hezekiah’s sickness and his recovery
1 About that time, Hezekiah became very ill. He thought that he was about to die.
Isaiah the prophet came to him and said, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘You should tell
the people in your palace what you want them to do after you die, because you are
not going to recover from this illness. You are going to die.’ ”
2 Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed,
3 “Yahweh, do not forget that I have always served you faithfully, and I have done
things that pleased you.” Then Hezekiah started to cry loudly.
4 Isaiah left the king, but before he had crossed the middle courtyard of the palace,
Yahweh gave him a message
5 which said, “Go back to Hezekiah, the ruler of my people, and say to him, ‘I,
Yahweh, the God whom your ancestor King David worshiped, have heard what you
prayed. And I have seen your tears. So, listen: I will heal you. Two days from now
you will be able to go up to my temple.
6 I will enable you to live for 15 more years. And I will rescue you and this city
again from the power [MTY] of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for the sake
of my own reputation and because of what I promised King David, who served me
well.’ ”
7 So Isaiah returned to the palace and told Hezekiah what Yahweh had said. Then he
saidto Hezekiah’s servants, “Bring a paste made of boiled figs. Put some of it on his
boil, and he will get well.”
8 Then Hezekiah replied to Isaiah, “What will Yahweh do to prove that he will heal
me and that two days from now I will be able to go up to the temple?”
9 Isaiah replied, “Yahweh will do something that will prove to you that he will do
what he promised. Do you want him to cause the shadow on the stairway/sundial to
go back ten steps/degrees, or to go forward ten steps/degrees?”
10 Hezekiah replied, “It is easy to cause the shadow to move forward, because that
is what it always does. Tell him to cause it to move backward ten steps/degrees.”
11 So Isaiah prayed earnestly to Yahweh, and Yahweh caused the shadow to go
backward ten steps/degrees on the stairway/sundial that King Ahaz had made (OR,
that workers had built for King Ahaz).
The messengers from the king of Babylonia
12 At that time, King Merodach-Baladan, the son of Baladan the previous King of
Babylonia, heard a report that King Hezekiah had been very sick. So he wrote some
letters and gave them to some messengers to take to Hezekiah, along with a gift.
13 When the messengers arrived, Hezekiah welcomed them gladly. Then he showed
them everything that was in his ◄treasure houses/places where very valuable things
were stored►—the silver and gold, the spices, the nice-smelling olive oil, and all the
2 KINGS 20:14
564
2 KINGS 21:7
weapons for his soldiers. He showed them all the valuable things in his storerooms
and everywhere else in his kingdom [HYP]; he showed them everything.
14 Then the prophet Isaiah went to Hezekiah and asked him, “Where did those men
come from, and what did they say to you?”
Hezekiah replied, “They came from a country very far from here. They came from
Babylonia.”
15 Isaiah asked, “What did they see in your palace?”
Hezekiah replied, “They saw everything. I showed them absolutely everything that
I own—all my valuable things.”
16 Isaiah knew that Hezekiah had done a very foolish thing. So Isaiah said to him,
“Listen to what Yahweh says to you.
17 There will be a time when everything that is still in your palace, all the valuable
things that were put there by you and your ancestors, will be carried away to Babylon.
There will be nothing left here! That is what Yahweh says to you
18 Furthermore, some of your own descendants will be forced to go there, and they
will be castrated in order that they may become servants in the palace of the King of
Babylon.”
19 Then Hezekiah replied to Isaiah, “That message from Yahweh that you have given
to me is good.” He said that because he was thinking, “Even if that happens, there
will be peace and security in Israel all the rest of my life.”
20 If you want to know more about [RHQ] all the other things that Hezekiah did,
about his brave deeds in battle, about his ordering a reservoir to be built in the city
and a tunnel to be dug to bring water into the reservoir, they are all written in the
scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Judah’.
21 Later Hezekiah died [EUP], and his son Manasseh became the king.
King Manasseh of Judah
21
1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to rule.
He ruled Judah for 55
years from Jerusalem. His mother was Hephzibah.
2 He did many things that Yahweh considered to be evil. He imitated the disgusting
things that were formerly done by the people of the nations that Yahweh had expelled
from the land of Israel as his people advanced through the land.
3 He commanded his workers to rebuild the shrines for worshiping Yahweh that his
father Hezekiah had destroyed because they were not in the place that Yahweh had
said they should worship him. He directed his workers to build altars for worshiping
Baal. He made a statue of the goddess Asherah, like Ahab the king of Israel had done
previously. And Manasseh worshiped [DOU] the stars.
4 He directed his workers to build altars for worshiping foreign gods in the temple of
Yahweh, about which Yahweh had said, “It is here in Jerusalem where I want people
to worship [MTY] me, forever.”
5 He directed that altars for worshiping the stars be built in both of the courtyards
outside the temple.
6 He even sacrificed his own son by burning him in a fire. He performed rituals to
of dead people to find out what would happen in the future. He did many things that
Yahweh considered to be extremely evil, things that caused Yahweh to become very
7 He placed the statue of the goddess Asherah in the temple, the place about which
2 KINGS 21:25
This is the city that I have chosen from all the territory of the twelve tribes of Israel,
where I want people to worship me, forever.
8 And if the Israeli people obey all my commands and all the laws that I gave to
Moses, the man who served me very well, I will not again force them to leave this
land that I gave to their ancestors.”
9 But the people did not heed Yahweh. And Manasseh persuaded them to commit
sins that are more evil than the sins that were committed by the people of the nations
that Yahweh had expelled from the land as the Israeli people advanced.
10 These are some of the things that the prophets said many times, messages that
Yahweh had given them:
11 “Manasseh, the king of Judah, has done these abominable things, things that are
much worse than the things that the Amor people-group did in this land long ago. He
has persuaded the people of Judah to sin by worshiping idols.
12 Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh, the God whom you Israeli people worship, say:
I will the cause the people of Jerusalem and the rest of Judah to experience great
disasters. It will be terrible, with the result that everyone who hears about it will be
stunned [MTY].
13 I will judge and punish [MET] the people of Jerusalem like I punished the family
of King Ahab of Israel. I will ◄wipe Jerusalem clean/remove all the people from
Jerusalem►, like [MET] people wipe a plate and then turn it upside down after they
have finished eating, to show that they are now satisfied.
14 And I will abandon the people who remain alive, and I will allow their enemies
to conquer them and steal everything valuable from their land.
15 I will do this because my people have done things that I consider to be very evil,
things which have caused me to become very angry. They have caused me to become
angry continually, ever since their ancestors left Egypt.”
16 Manasseh commanded his officials to kill many innocent people in Jerusalem, with
the result that their blood flowed in the streets. He did this in addition to persuading
the people of Judah to sin against Yahweh by worshiping idols.
17 If you want to know more about all the things that Manasseh did, they are written
in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Judah’.
18 Manasseh died [EUP] and was buried in the garden outside his palace, the garden
that Uzza had made. Then Manasseh’s son Amon became the king.
King Amon of Judah
19 Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king.
He ruled Judah from
Jerusalem for only two years. His mother’s name was Meshullemeth. She was from
Jotbah town, and was the granddaughter of Haruz.
20 Amon did many things that Yahweh considered to be evil, like his father
Manasseh had done.
21 He imitated the behavior of his father, and he worshiped the same idols that his
father had worshiped [DOU].
22 He abandoned Yahweh, the God whom his ancestors had worshiped, and did not
behave as Yahweh wanted him to.
23 Then one day some of his officials plotted to kill him. They assassinated him in
the palace.
24 But then the people of Judah killed all those who had assassinated King Amon,
and they appointed his son Josiah to be their king.
25 If you want to read about [RHQ] the other things that Amon did, they are written
in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Judah’.

26 Amon was also buried in the tomb in the garden that Uzza had made.
Amon’s son Josiah became the king.

King Josiah of Judah
1 Josiah was eight years old when he became the king of Judah.
He ruled from
Jerusalem for 31 years. His mother was Jedidah and his grandfather was Adaiah
from Bozkath town.
2 Josiah did things that were pleasing to Yahweh and conducted his life as his
ancestor King David had done. He completely obeyed [IDM] all the laws of God.
3 After Josiah had been ruling for almost 18 years, he sent his secretary Shaphan,
the son of Azaliah and grandson of Meshullam, to the temple with these instructions:
4 “Go to Hilkiah, the Supreme Priest, and tell him to give me a report, telling me
how much money the men who guard the doors of the temple have collected from
the people as offerings.
repairing the temple.
they should also buy the timber and the stones that they will use to repair the temple.
7 But the men who supervise the work will not be required to make a report on
the money that is given to them, saying what they spent it for, because those men are
completely honest.”
8 After Shaphan said that to Hilkiah the king’s secretary, Hilkiah said to Shaphan,
“I have found in the temple a scroll on which is written the laws that God gave to
Moses!” Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan, and he started to read it.
9 Then Shaphan took the scroll to the king and said to him, “Your temple guards
have taken the money that was in the temple, and they have given it to the men who
will supervise the work of repairing the temple.”
10 Then Shaphan said to the king, “I have brought to you a scroll that Hilkiah gave
to me.” And Shaphan started to read it to the king.
11 When the king heard the laws that were written in the scroll that Shaphan was
reading to him, he tore his clothes because he was very dismayed.
12 Then he gave these instructions to Hilkiah, to Shaphan’s son Ahikam, to Micaiah’s
son Achbor, and to Asaiah, the king’s special advisor:
13 “Go and ask Yahweh for me and for all the people of Judah, about what is written
in this scroll that has been found. Because it is clear that Yahweh is very angry with
us because our ancestors disobeyed what was written on this scroll, things that we
should have done.”
14 So Hilkiah, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to ◄consult/talk with►
a woman whose name was Huldah, who was a prophetess who lived in the newer/
northern part of Jerusalem. Her husband Shallum, son of Tikvah and grandson of
Harhas, took care of the robes that were worn in the temple (OR, by the king). Those
five men told her about the scroll.
15 She said to them, “This is what Yahweh the God whom we Israelis worship says:
‘Go back and tell the king who sent you
16 that this is what Yahweh says: “Listen to this carefully. I am going to cause all
the people who live here in Jerusalem to experience a disaster, which is what was
written in the scroll that the king has read.
17 I will do that because they have abandoned me, and they burn incense to honor
other gods. They have caused me to become very angry by worshiping all the idols
2 KINGS 22:18
567
2 KINGS 23:8-9
that they have made (OR, by all the wicked things that they have done), and my anger
is like [MET] a fire that will not be put out.”
18 The king of Judah sent you to inquire what I, Yahweh, wanted you to do, so this
is what you should say to him: “Because you have heeded what was written in the
scroll,
19 and you repented and humbled yourself when you heard what I said to warn
you about what would happen to this city and the people who live here and because
you tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have heard you. I said that I would
cause this city to be abandoned. It will be a city whose name people will use when
they curse someone. But I have heard what you prayed,
20 so I will allow you to die [EUP] and be buried peacefully. I will cause the people
who live here to experience a terrible disaster, but you will not be alive to see it.” ’ ”
Josiah got rid of pagan worship
1 Then the king summoned all the elders of Jerusalem and of the other places in
Judah.
2 They went together to the temple, along with the priests and the prophets, and
many other [HYP] people, from the most important people to the least important
people. And while they listened, the king read to them all of the laws that Moses had
written. He read from the scroll that had been found in the temple.
3 Then the king stood next to the pillar where the kings stood when they made
important announcements, and while Yahweh was listening, he repeated his promise
to sincerely obey [DOU] all of Yahweh’s commands and regulations [DOU]. He also
promised to ◄fulfill the conditions of/do what was written in► the agreement he
made with Yahweh. And all the people also promised to obey the agreement.
4 Then the king commanded Hilkiah the Supreme Priest and all the other priests
who assisted him and the men who guarded the entrance to the temple to bring
out from the temple all the items that people had been using to worship Baal, the
goddess Asherah, and the stars. After they carried them out, they burned all those
things outside the city near the Kidron Valley. Then they took all the ashes to Bethel,
because that city was already considered to be desecrated/unholy.
5 There were many pagan priests that the previous kings of Judah had appointed
to burn incense on the altars on the tops of hills in Judah. They had been offering
sacrifices to Baal, to the sun, the moon, the planets, and the stars. The king stopped
them from doing those things.
6 He commanded that the statue of the goddess Asherah be taken out of the temple.
Then they took it outside Jerusalem, down to the Kidron Brook, and burned it. Then
they pounded the ashes to powder and scattered that over the graves in the public
cemetery.
7 He also destroyed the rooms in the temple where the temple male prostitutes
Asherah.
8-9 Josiah also brought to Jerusalem all the priests who were offering sacrifices in
the other cities in Judah. He also desecrated the places on the tops of hills where the
priests had burned incense to honor idols, from Geba in the north to Beersheba in the
south. Those priests were not allowed to offer sacrifices in the temple, but they were
allowed to eat the unleavened bread that the priests who worked in the temple ate.
He also commanded that the altars that were dedicated to the goat demons near the
2 KINGS 23:10
568
2 KINGS 23:21
gate built by Joshua, the mayor of Jerusalem, be destroyed. Those altars were at the
left of the main gate into the city.
10 Josiah also desecrated the place named Topheth, in the Hinnom Valley, in order
that no one could offer his son or daughter there to be completely burned for a
sacrifice to the god Molech.
11 He also removed the horses that the previous kings of Judah had dedicated to
worshiping the sun, and he burned the chariots that were used in that worship. Those
horses and chariots were kept in the courtyard outside the temple, near the entrance
to the temple, and near the room where one of Josiah’s officials, whose name was
Nathan-Melech, lived.
12 Josiah also commanded his servants to tear down the altars that the previous
had stayed. They also tore down the altars that had been built by King Manasseh
pieces and thrown down into the Kidron Valley.
south of Olive Tree Hill, be desecrated. Solomon had built them for the worship of the
disgusting idols—the statue of the goddess Astarte worshiped by the people in Sidon
city, Chemosh the god of the Moab people-group, and Molech the god of the Ammon
people-group.
14 They also broke into pieces the stone pillars that the Israeli people worshiped,
and cut down the pillars that honored the goddess Asherah, and they scattered the
ground there with human bones to desecrate it.
15 Furthermore, he commanded them to tear down the place of worship at Bethel
which had been built by King Jeroboam #1, the king who persuaded the people of
Israel to sin. They tore down the altar. Then they broke its stones into pieces and
pounded them to become powder. They also burned the statue of the goddess Asherah.
16 Then Josiah looked around and saw some tombs there on the hill. He commanded
his men to take the bones out of those tombs and burn them on the altar. By doing
that, he desecrated the altar. That was what a prophet had predicted many years
before when Jeroboam #1 was standing close to that altar at a festival.
Then Josiah looked up and saw the tomb of the prophet who had predicted that.
17 Josiah asked, “Whose tomb is that?” The people of Bethel replied, “It is the tomb
of the prophet who came from Judah and predicted that these things that you have
just now done to this altar would happen.”
18 Josiah replied, “Allow his tomb to remain as it is. Do not remove the prophet’s
bones from the tomb.”
So the people did not remove those bones, or the bones of the other prophet, the
one who had come from Samaria.
19 In every city in Israel, at Josiah’s command, they tore down the shrines that had
been built by the previous kings of Israel, which had caused Yahweh to become very
angry. He did to all those shrines/altars the same thing that he had done to the altars
at Bethel.
20 He ordered that all the priests who offered sacrifices on the altars on the tops of
hills must be killed on those altars. Then he burned human bones on every one of
those altars to desecrate them. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
Josiah had them celebrate the Passover Festival
21 Then the king commanded all the people to celebrate the Passover Festival to
honor Yahweh their God, which was written in the law of Moses that they should do
every year.
2 KINGS 23:22
569
2 KINGS 23:35
22 During all the years that leaders ruled Israel and during all the years that kings
had ruled Israel and Judah, they had not celebrated that festival.
23 But now, after Josiah had been ruling for almost 18 years, to honor Yahweh they
celebrated the Passover Festival in Jerusalem.
Judah who practiced sorcery and those who requested the spirits of dead people to
tell them what they should do. He also removed from Jerusalem and from the other
places in Judah all the household idols and all the other idols and abominable things.
He did those things in order to obey what had been written in the scroll that Hilkiah
had found in the temple.
25 Josiah was totally devoted to Yahweh. There had never been in Judah or Israel a
king like him. He obeyed all the laws of Moses. And there has never since then been
a king like Josiah.
26 But Yahweh had become extremely angry with the people of Judah because of
all the things that King Manasseh had done to infuriate him, and he continued to be
very angry.
27 He said, “I will do to Judah what I have done to Israel. I will banish the people of
Judah, with the result that they will never enter my presence again. And I will reject
Jerusalem, the city that I chose to belong to me, and I will abandon the temple, the
place where I said that I [MTY] should be worshiped.”
The end of Josiah’s rule of Judah
28 If you want to know more about [RHQ] all the other things that Josiah did, they
are written in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Judah’.
29 While Josiah was the king of Judah, King Neco of Egypt led his army north to
the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria. King Josiah tried to stop the army of
Egypt at Megiddo city, but Josiah was killed in a battle there.
30 His officials placed his corpse in a chariot and took it back to Jerusalem, where
it was buried in his own tomb, a tomb where the other previous kings had not been
buried.
Then the people of Judah poured olive oil on the head of Josiah’s son Joahaz, to
appoint him to be the new king.
King Joahaz of Judah
31 Joahaz was 23 years old when he became the king of Judah, but he ruled from
Jerusalem for only three months. His mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah
from Libnah city.
32 Joahaz did many things that Yahweh said were evil, just like many of his ancestors
had done.
33 King Neco’s army came from Egypt and captured him and tied him up with chains
and took him as a prisoner to Riblah town in Hamath district, to prevent him from
continuing to rule in Jerusalem. Neco forced the people of Judah to pay to him ◄7,500
pounds/3,400 kg.► of silver and ◄75 pounds/34 kg.► of gold.
34 King Neco appointed another son of Josiah, Eliakim, to be the new king, and he
changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. Then he took Joahaz to Egypt, and later Joahaz
died there in Egypt.
King Jehoiakim of Judah
35 King Jehoiakim collected a tax from the people of Judah. He collected more from
in order to pay to the king of Egypt what he commanded them to give.
2 KINGS 23:36
570
2 KINGS 24:16
36 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became the king of Judah, and he
ruled from Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother was Zebidah, the daughter of
Pedaiah from Rumah town.
37 He did many things that Yahweh says are evil, like his ancestors had done.
24
1 While Jehoiakim was ruling Judah, the army of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon
invaded Judah. They defeated the Judean army, and as a result, Jehoiakim was required
to pay a lot of tribute/taxes to King Nebuchadnezzar. But after three years, Jehoiakim
rebelled.
2 Then Yahweh sent raiders from Babylonia and Syria, and from the Moab and
Ammon people-groups, to attack the people of Judah and get rid of them, just as
Yahweh had told his prophets to warn the people would happen.
3 These things happened to the people of Judah according to what Yahweh
commanded. He had decided to get rid of the people of Judah because of the many
sins that King Manasseh had committed.
4 Manasseh had even caused many innocent people in Jerusalem to be killed, and
Yahweh would not forgive that.
5 The other things that happened while Jehoiakim was king, and all the things that
he did, are written in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Judah’.
7 The army of the king of Babylon defeated the army of Egypt, and took control of all
in the south to the Euphrates River in the north. So the army of the king of Egypt did
Jehoiachin ruled Judah
8 Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became the king of Judah.
His mother’s
name was Nehushta; she was the daughter of a man from Jerusalem named Elnathan.
Jehoiachin ruled in Jerusalem for only three months.
9 Jehoiachin did many things that Yahweh considered to be evil, just as his father
had done.
10 While Jehoiachin was king, some officers of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon
came along with the whole Babylonian army to Jerusalem, and they surrounded the
city.
11 While they were doing that, Nebuchadnezzar himself came to the city.
12 Then King Jehoiachin and his mother and his advisors and important officers
and palace officials all surrendered to the Babylonian army.
These thngs happened when Nebuchadnezzar had been king for eight years. He
arrested Jehoiachin and took him to Babylon.
13 Just as Yahweh had said would happen, Nebuchadnezzar’s soldiers took to
Babylon all the valuable things from Yahweh’s temple and from the king’s palace.
They cut apart all the gold items that King Solomon had put in the temple.
14 They took from Jerusalem to Babylon 10,000 people, including the important
officials and the best soldiers and the people who made and repaired things that
were made of metal. Only the very poor people were left in Judah.
15 Nebuchadnezzar’s soldiers also took to Babylon Jehoiachin’s wives and officials,
his mother, and all the important people.
16 They also took to Babylon 7,000 of the best soldiers and 1,000 men who knew
how to make and repair things that are made from metal. All of these people whom
they took were strong and able to fight in wars.
2 KINGS 24:17
571
2 KINGS 25:12
17 Then the king of Babylon appointed Jehoiachin’s uncle, Mattaniah, to be the king
of Judah, and he changed Mattaniah’s name to Zedekiah.
Zedekiah ruled in Judah
18 When Zedekiah was twenty-one years old,
he became king, and he ruled in
Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal; she was the daughter
of a man named Jeremiah from Libnah town.
19 But Zedekiah did many things that Yahweh considered to be evil, just as Jehoiakim
had done.
20 Yahweh was very angry. So ◄and finally/after he had been patient a long time►
he expelled the people of Jerusalem and the other places in Judah and sent them to
Babylon.
Jerusalem was destroyed
That is what happened when Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
25
1 On January 15 of the ninth year that Zedekiah had been ruling, King Nebuchad-
nezzar arrived with his whole army, and they surrounded Jerusalem. They built
ramps made of dirt against the walls of the city, so that they could climb up the ramps
and attack the city.
2 They did that for two years.
3 After Zedekiah had been ruling for eleven years, the ◄famine/shortage of food►
had become very bad. All their food was gone.
4 On July 18 of that year, the Babylonian soldiers broke through part of the city wall,
and that enabled them to enter the city. All the soldiers of Judah wanted to escape.
But the Babylonian soldiers surrounded the city, so the king and the soldiers of Judah
waited until it was nighttime. Then they fled through the gate that was between the
two walls near the king’s park. They ran across the fields and started to go down to
5 But the Babylonian soldiers chased/ran after them. They caught the king when he
soldiers had abandoned him.
king of Babylon decided what they would do to punish him.
7 There the king of Babylon forced Zedekiah to watch as the Babylonian soldiers
killed all of Zedekiah’s sons. Then they gouged out Zedekiah’s eyes. They put bronze
chains on his hands and feet and then they took him to Babylon.
8 On August 14 of that year, after Nebuchadnezzar had been ruling for 19 years,
Nebuzaradan arrived in Jerusalem. He was one of king Nebuchadnezzar’s officials
and captain of the men that guarded the king.
9 He commanded his soldiers to burn down the temple of Yahweh, the king’s palace,
and all the houses in Jerusalem. So they burned down all the important buildings in
the city.
10 Then Nebuzaradan supervised all the soldiers of the Babylonian army as they
tore down the walls of Jerusalem.
11 Then he and his soldiers took to Babylon the people who were still living in the
city, the other people who lived in that area, and the soldiers who had previously
surrendered to the Babylonian army.
12 But Nebuzaradan allowed some of the very poor people to stay in Judah to take
care of the vineyards and to plant crops in the fields.
2 KINGS 25:13
572
2 KINGS 25:27
13 The Babylonian soldiers broke into pieces the bronze pillars, the bronze carts
with wheels, and the huge bronze basin, all of which were in the temple courtyard,
and they took all the bronze to Babylon.
14 They also took the pots, the shovels, the instruments for ◄snuffing out/
extinguishing► the wicks of the lamps, the dishes, and all the other bronze items
that the Israeli priests had used for offering sacrifices at the temple.
15 The soldiers also took away the ◄firepans/trays for carrying burning coals►, the
basins, and all the other items made of pure gold or pure silver.
16 The bronze from the two pillars, the carts with wheels, and the huge basin were
very heavy; they could not be weighed. ◄Those things had been made/A man named
Hiram had made these things► for the temple when Solomon was the king of Israel.
17 Each of the pillars was ◄27 feet/ 8 meters► tall. The bronze capital/ top of
each pillar was ◄7-1/2 feet/2.3 meters► high. They were each decorated all around
with something that looked like a net made of bronze chains connecting bronze
pomegranates.
18 Nebuzaradan took with him to Babylon Seraiah the Supreme Priest, Zephaniah
his assistant, and the three men who guarded the entrance to the temple.
19 And they found people who were still hiding in Jerusalem. From those people he
took one officer from the Judean army, five of the king’s advisors, the chief secretary
of the army commander who was in charge of recruiting men to join the army, and
60 other important Judean men.
20 Nebuzaradan took them all to the king of Babylon at Riblah city.
21 There at Riblah, in Hamath province, the king of Babylon commanded that they
all be executed.
That is what happened when the people of Judah were ◄taken forcefully/exiled►
Gedaliah was appointed governor in Judah
22 Then King Nebuchadnezzar appointed Gedaliah, who was the son of Ahikam and
grandson of Shaphan, to be the governor of the people who were still living in Judah.
23 When all the army captains of Judah and their soldiers who had not surrendered
to Nebuchadnezzar found out that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah to be
the governor, they met with him at Mizpah town. These army captains were Ishmael
the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth from
Netophah town, and Jaazaniah from the Maacah region.
24 Gedaliah solemnly promised them that the officials from Babylon were not
planning to harm them. He said, “You may live in this land without being afraid
and serve the king of Babylon, and if you do, everything will go well for you.”
25 But in October of that year, Ishmael, whose grandfather Elishama was one of the
relatives of the descendants of King David, went to Mizpah along with ten other men
and assassinated/killed Gedaliah and all the men who were with him. There were
also men from Judah and men from Babylon whom they assassinated.
26 Then many [HYP] of the people from Judah, important people and unimportant
ones, and the army captains, were very afraid of what the Babylonians would do to
them, so they fled to Egypt.
Jehoiachin was released
years after King Jehoiachin of Judah was taken to Babylon,
Nebuchadnezzar’s son Evil-Merodach became the king of Babylon. He was kind to
Jehoiachin, and on April 2 of that year, he released/freed Jehoiachin from prison.
27 Thirty-seven
2 KINGS 25:28
573
2 KINGS 25:30
28 He always spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and honored him more than the other kings
who had been taken/exiled to Babylon.
29 He gave Jehoiachin new clothes to replace the clothes that he had been wearing
in prison, and he allowed Jehoiachin to eat at the king’s table every day for the rest
of his life.
30 The king of Babylon also gave him money every day, so that he could buy the
things that he needed. The king continued to do that until Jehoiachin died.

to Gedor and fought against the descendants of Ham and destroyed their tents. They
also fought against the descendants of Meun who were living there, and they killed
all of them. So now there are no descendants of Meun living there. The descendants
of Simeon started to live there, because there was good pastureland there for their
sheep.
42 Ishi’s four sons Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah and Uzziel led 500 other descendants
of Simeon and attacked the people who were living in the hilly area of the Edom region.
43 They killed the few descendants of Amalek who were still alive. From that time
until now, the descendants of Simeon have lived in the Edom region.
5
The descendants of Reuben
1 Reuben was the oldest son of Jacob. Therefore, he should have received the special
rights/privileges that belonged to firstborn sons. But he had sex with his father’s slave
wife, so his father gave the rights if a firstborn son to the sons of Reubers younger
brother Joseph. And in the family records, Reuben is not mentioned first, like the
firstborn sons always are.
2 Although Judah became more influential than his brothers, and a ruler of the tribe
descended from him, Joseph’s family received the rights that belonged to firstborn
sons.

7 The names of these clans are listed here according to what is written in their
family records.
The first name written was Jeiel. Then Zechariah,
8 and then Bela. Bela was the son of Azaz, and Azaz was the son of Shema, and
Shema was the son of Joel. Reuben’s clan was very large. Some of them lived near
Aroer city as far north as Nebo town and Baal-Meon city.
9 Some of them lived further east, as far as the edge of the desert south of the
Euphrates River. They went there because they had a huge amount of cattle, with the
result that there was not enough pastureland for them in the Gilead region.
10 When Saul was king of Israel, Bela’s clan fought against the descendants of Hagar
and defeated them. After that, Bela’s clan lived in the tents that the descendants
of Hagar had lived in previously, in all the area east of the Gilead region.
The descendants of Gad
1 CHRONICLES 5:11
582

time that Jotham was the king of Judah and Jeroboam was the king of Israel.
The armies of the tribes that lived east of the Jordan River
18 There were 44,760 soldiers from the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the eastern
half of the tribe of Manasseh. They all carried shields and swords and bows and
arrows. They were all trained to fight well in battles.
19 They attacked the descendants of Hagar and the people of Jetur, Naphish, and
Nodab cities.
20 The men from those three tribes prayed to God during the battles, requesting
him to help them. So he helped them, because they trusted in him. He enabled them
to defeat [IDM] the descendants of Hagar and all those who were helping them.
21 They took the animals that belonged to the descendants of Hagar: They took
50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, and 2,000 donkeys. They also captured 100,000 people.
22 But many descendants of Hagar were killed because God helped the people of
the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh. After that, those three tribes lived in that
area until the army of Babylonia captured them and took them away to Babylon.
The eastern half of the tribe of Manasseh
were many people who belonged to the eastern half of the tribe of
Manasseh. They lived in the Bashan region east of the Jordan River, as far north
as Baal-Hermon, Senir, and Hermon Mountain.
24 Their clan leaders were Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel.
They were all strong, brave, and famous soldiers, and leaders of their clans.
25 But they sinned against God, the one whom their ancestors had worshiped. They
began to worship the gods/idols that the people of that region had worshiped, the
people whom God had enabled them to destroy!
26 So the God whom the Israelis worshiped caused Pul, the king of Assyria, to
conquer those tribes. Pul’s other name was Tiglath-Pileser. His army captured the
people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the eastern half of the tribe of Manasseh,
and took them to various places in Assyria: Halah, Habor, Hara and near the Gozan
River. They have lived in those places from that time to the present time.

593
1 CHRONICLES 11:6
weapons was terrified and refused to do that. So Saul took his own sword and fell
on it and died.
5 When the man carrying his weapons saw that Saul was dead, he also threw himself
on his own sword and died.
6 So Saul and three of his sons all died, and none of his descendants ever became
king.

even went to a woman who talks to the spirits of dead people and asked her what he
should do,

he appointed David, the son of Jesse, to be the king of Israel.

And all the Israeli
people ◄were happy that David was/supported David as► their king.
There were many soldiers/warriors who helped David’s kingdom to remain strong.
11 This is a list of the leaders of David’s most mighty warriors:
Jashobeam was from the Hacmon clan. He was one of the leaders of David’s most
powerful soldiers. One time he fought against 300 enemies and killed them all with

victory on that day.

was camping next to the huge rock outside the cave near Adullam. At that same time,
the army of Philistia had camped in the Rephaim Valley.
16 David was in a fortress, and some of the soldiers of Philistia were occupying
Bethlehem.

some water from the well near the gate at Bethlehem!”
18 So those three most outstanding warriors forced their way through the camp of
Philistia soldiers and drew some water from the well, and brought it to David. But
he would not drink it. Instead, he poured it out on the ground to be an offering to
Yahweh.
19 He said, “Yahweh, it would certainly not be right for me to drink this water! That
would be like [RHQ] drinking the blood of these men who were willing/ready to die
for me!” So he refused to drink it.
That was one of the things that those three most outstanding warriors did.
20 Joab’s younger brother Abishai was the leader of the 30 most mighty warriors.
One time Abishai fought 300 enemy soldiers with his spear and killed them.

their commander, even though he was not one of those three men.

deeds. He killed two of the best warriors from the Moab people-group. One day he
went down into a pit when snow was falling on the ground and killed a lion there.

soldier from Egypt carried a spear that was as long as a weaver’s rod. Benaiah had
only a club, but he grabbed the other man’s spear and killed him with it.
24 Those are some of the things that Benaiah did. So he became as famous as the
three mighty warriors.

Some warriors joined David
1 David went to Ziklag town to escape from King Saul.
While he was there, many
warriors came and joined him, and they helped him when he fought battles.
2 They carried bows and arrows. They were able to shoot arrows and to sling
stones. They could use either their right arms or their left arms to do that. They
were relatives of Saul from the tribe of Benjamin.
3 Their leader was Ahiezer. Next in command was Joash. They were both sons of
Shemaah from Gibeah city. These are the names of some of those warriors:
Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth;
Beracah;
Jehu from Anathoth town;
4 Ishmaiah from the Gibeon city, who was a leader of the thirty mighty warriors;
Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and Jozabad from Gederah town;
5 Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah from Haruph town;
6 Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer and Jashobeam, who were descendants of Korah;
7 Joelah and Zebadiah, who were sons of Jeroham, from Gedor town.
8 Some men from the tribe of Gad east of the Jordan River joined David when he
was at his fortress in the caves in the desert. They were brave warriors who were
trained for fighting battles and able to use shields and spears well. They [SYN] were
as fierce as [SIM, MTY] lions, and they could run as fast as [HYP, SIM] deer/gazelles
on the hills/mountains.
9 Ezer was their leader.
Next in command was Obadiah.
Next was Eliab.
10 Next was Mishmannah.
Next was Jeremiah.
11 Next was Attai.
Next was Eliel.
12 Next was Johanan.
Next was Elzabad.
13 Next was another man whose name was Jeremiah.
The last was Macbannai.
14 Those men from the tribe of Gad were all army officers.
Some of them
commanded 1,000 soldiers, and some of them commanded 100 soldiers.
15 They crossed to the west side of the Jordan River during March, at the time of the
year when the river was flooded. They chased from there all the people who lived in
the valleys on both sides of the river.
16 Some other men from the tribe of Benjamin and from Judah also came to David
in his fortress.
peacefully to help me, I am eager to have you join with me. But if you have come
harm you, I hope/wish that the God whom our ancestors ◄worshiped/belonged to►
18 Then God’s Spirit came upon Amasai, who was another leader of the thirty
greatest warriors, and he said,
“David, we want to be with you;
you who are the son of Jesse, we will join you.
We know that things will go very well [DOU] for you and for those who are with you,
because your God is helping you.”
1 CHRONICLES 12:19
597
1 CHRONICLES 12:38
19 So David welcomed those men,
and he appointed them to be leaders of his
soldiers. Some men from the tribe of Manasseh also joined David when he went
with the soldiers of Philistia to fight against Saul’s army. But David and his men did
not really help the army of Philistia. After the leaders of Philistia talked about David
and his soldiers, they sent David away. They said, “If David joins his master Saul
again, we will all be killed {his army will kill all of us}!”
20 When David went to Ziklag, these were the men from the tribe of Manasseh
who went with him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, another man whose name was
Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai. Each of them had been a commander of 1,000 men in
Saul’s army.
21 They were all brave soldiers, and they helped David to fight against the groups
of men who roamed throughout the country, robbing people. So those men became
commanders in David’s army.
22 Every day more men joined David’s men, and his army became large, like [SIM]
the army of God (OR, a very huge army).
Others joined David at Hebron
23 These are the numbers of soldiers who were ready for battle who joined David
at Hebron city. They came to help him to become the king of Israel to replace Saul,
as Yahweh had promised would happen.
24 There were 6,800 men from Judah, who carried shields and spears.
25 There were 7,100 men from the tribe of Simeon. They were all strong warriors
trained to fight battles.
26 There were 4,600 men from the tribe of Levi.
27 Jehoiada, who was a leader descended from Aaron, was in that group of
descendants of Levi, and there were 3,700 men with him.
28 Zadok, a strong young soldier, was also in that group, and there were 22 other
leaders from his clan who came with him.
29 There were 3,000 men from the tribe of Benjamin who were Saul’s relatives.
Most of them had previously wanted one of Saul’s descendants to be the king.
30 There were 20,800 men from the tribe of Ephraim who were all brave warriors
and trained for fighting battles and famous in their own clans.
31 There were 18,000 men from the half of the tribe of Manasseh that lived west of
the Jordan River. They were all chosen to go and help David become the king.
32 There were 200 men who were leaders from the tribe of Issachar, along with
knew the right time to do it.
warriors and knew how to use all kinds of weapons well. They were completely
loyal to David.
34 There were 1,000 officers from the tribe of Naphtali. With them were 37,000
soldiers, each carrying shields and spears.
35 There were 28,600 soldiers from the tribe of Dan, all trained to fight battles.
36 There were 47,000 experienced soldiers from the tribe of Asher, all trained to
fight battles.
37 There were also 120,000 soldiers from the area east of the Jordan River who joined
David. They were from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the eastern half of the tribe
of Manasseh. They had all kinds of weapons.
38 All those men were soldiers who volunteered to be in David’s army. They came to
Hebron wanting very much to enable David to be the king of all of the Israeli people.
1 CHRONICLES 12:39
598
1 CHRONICLES 13:14
39 The men spent three days there with David, eating and drinking, because their
families had given them food to take with them.
40 Also, their fellow Israelis came from as far away as the area where the tribes of
Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali lived, bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and
oxen. They brought a lot of flour, fig cakes, raisins, wine, olive oil, cattle and sheep.
And throughout Israel, the people were very joyful.
13
Bringing back the Sacred Chest
1 One day David talked with all his army officers. Some of them were commanders
of 100 soldiers and some were commanders of 1,000 soldiers.
2 Then he summoned the other Israeli leaders and said to all of them, “If it seems
to you to be a good thing for us to do, and if it is what Yahweh our God wants, let’s
send a message to our fellow Israelis in all the areas of our country, including the
priests and other descendants of Levi who are living among them in their towns and
in the nearby pasturelands, to come and join us,
3 because we want to bring the Sacred Chest of our God back to us. While Saul was
the king, we did not go to God’s presence to ask him what we should do.”
4 All the people agreed with David, because they all thought that it was the right
thing to do.
5 So David gathered all the Israeli people, from the Shihor River in Egypt to LeboHamath town in the north, and told them that he wanted them to help bring the Sacred
Chest of God back to Jerusalem from Kiriath-Jearim city.
6 David went with all the Israeli people to Baalah town, which is another name
for Kiriath-Jearim, to get the Sacred Chest. The people believed that God ruled from
between the statues of winged creatures that was above the lid of the Sacred Chest
[MTY].
7 The people put the Sacred Chest on a new cart and transported it from Abinadab’s
8 David and all the Israeli people were celebrating in God’s presence with all their
blowing trumpets.
9 But when David’s men came to the place where Kidon threshed grain, the oxen
stumbled. So Uzzah reached out with his hand to prevent the Sacred Chest from
falling off the cart.
10 Yahweh immediately became very angry with Uzzah, and he caused Uzzah to
suddenly die there because he had put his hand on the Sacred Chest, and Yahweh had
commanded that only the descendants of Levi who help the priests should touch the
Sacred Chest.
11 David was angry because Yahweh had punished [MTY] Uzzah. And now that
place where Uzzah died is called ‘The Punishment of Uzzah’.
12 That day, David was afraid of God. He asked himself, “◄How can I bring God’s
Sacred Chest to my city?/I am afraid to bring God’s Sacred Chest to my city.►” [RHQ]
13 So the men with David did not take the Sacred Chest to Jerusalem. Instead, they
took it to the house of Obed-Edom, who was from Gath city.
14 The Sacred Chest stayed with Obed-Edom’s family in his house for three months.
And during that time Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom’s family and everything that he
owned.

David’s palace and his family
1 One day Hiram, the king of Tyre city, sent some messengers to David to talk
about making an agreement between their countries. Then Hiram sent cedar logs,
bricklayers, and carpenters to build a palace for David.
2 When that happened, David knew that Yahweh had truly caused him to be the
king of Israel, and that he had caused his kingdom to be greatly respected. Yahweh
did this because he loved his Israeli people.
3 David married more women in Jerusalem, and those women gave birth to more
sons and daughters for him.
4 The names of the children that were born to him there in Jerusalem are Shammua,
Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
5 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
6 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
7 Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
David’s army defeated the army of Philistia
8 When the army of Philistia heard that David has been appointed to be king of all
of Israel, they came to capture him. But David heard that they were coming, so he
and his soldiers marched out to fight against them.
Jerusalem and had robbed them.
we go, will you enable us to defeat [IDM] them?”
11 So David and his men went up to a town where the soldiers of Philistia were
staying and defeated them. Then David said, “God has enabled me and my soldiers
to overwhelm my enemies like [MET] a flood.” So they named that place {That place
is called} ‘Baal-Perazim’ which means ‘Yahweh breaks through’.
12 As the soldiers of Philistia fled, they left their idols there. So David commanded
his soldiers to burn those idols.
13 But soon the army of Philistia attacked the people in that valley again.
14 So again David prayed to God to ask him what he should do, and God replied,
saying “Do not attack the army of Philistia from the front. Instead, go around them,
and attack them from the rear in front of the balsam trees.
15 When you hear something in the tops of the balsam trees that sounds like soldiers
marching, attack them. I, God, will have gone ahead of you to enable you to defeat
the army of Philistia.”
16 So David did what God commanded him to do, and he and his army defeated the
army of Philistia, all the way from Gibeon city in the east to Gezer city in the west.
17 So David became famous in all the nearby countries, and Yahweh caused the
leaders of all the nearby nations to be afraid of him.
15
They brought the Sacred Chest to Jerusalem
1 David commanded his workers to build some houses for him in Jerusalem. He also
told them to set up a tent in which to put the Sacred Chest.
2 He said, “Only the descendants of Levi are permitted to carry God’s Sacred Chest,
because they are the ones whom God chose to carry it and to serve him forever.”
1 CHRONICLES 15:3
600
3 David summoned all the people of Israel to come to Jerusalem.
1 CHRONICLES 15:25
He wanted the
Sacred Chest of Yahweh to be put in the place that he had made for it.
4 He summoned the descendants of Aaron, who was the first Supreme Priest, and
5 120 descendants of Kohath, who was Levi’s second son, came, with Uriel their
leader.
6 There were 220 descendants of Merari, Levi’s third son, who came, with Asaiah
their leader.
7 There were 130 descendants of Gershon, Levi’s first son, who came, with Joel their
leader.
8 There were 200 people from Elizaphan’s clan who came, with Shemaiah their
leader.
9 There were 80 people from Hebron’s clan who came, with Eliel their leader.
10 And there were 112 people from Uzziel’s clan who came, with Amminadab their
11 David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar and these other descendants of
12 David said to them, “You are the leaders of the clans descended from Levi. You
this special work for Yahweh. You must bring the Sacred Chest of Yahweh, the God of
13 The first time that we tried to bring it, we did not ask Yahweh how we should
carry it {it should be carried}. You descendants of Levi were not the ones who carried
it, so Yahweh our God punished us.”
14 Then the priests and the other descendants of Levi performed the rituals to purify
themselves, in order that it would be proper for them to do the work of carrying the
Sacred Chest of Yahweh, the God of us Israeli people.
15 The descendants of Levi inserted the poles into the rings on the Sacred Chest so
that with them, they could carry the Sacred Chest on their shoulders, like Moses had
commanded, and like Yahweh had said that they should.
16 David told the leaders of the descendants of Levi to appoint some of their relatives
to sing joyful songs and play lyres, harps, and cymbals while they were carrying the
Sacred Chest.
17 So they appointed Heman and his relatives Asaph and Ethan. Heman was the son
of Joel; Asaph was the son of Berekiah. Ethan, a descendant of Merari, was Kushaiah’s
son.
18 There was also another group of descendants of Levi who were appointed:
Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah,
Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and two of the Sacred Tent gatekeepers, Obed-Edom and Jeiel.
19 Heman, Asaph and Ethan sang, and also played bronze cymbals.
20 Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah played
lyres.
21 Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel and Azaziah played harps.
22 Kenaniah, the leader of the descendants of Levi, directed the singing because he
was very skilled at doing that.
23 Berekiah and Elkanah were two of the men who guarded the Sacred Chest.
24 The priests Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and
Eliezer were appointed to blow trumpets in front of the Sacred Chest. Obed-Edom
and Jehiah also guarded the Sacred Chest.
25 David and the Israeli leaders and the officers who commanded 1,000 soldiers
went to bring the Sacred Chest back from Obed-Edom’s house. They were very joyful
as they brought it to Jerusalem.
1 CHRONICLES 15:26
601
1 CHRONICLES 16:17
26 God helped the descendants of Levi who carried the Sacred Chest of Yahweh;
therefore David and the leaders sacrificed seven bulls and seven ◄rams/male sheep►
to thank him.
27 All the descendants of Levi who carried the Sacred Chest, all the singers, and
Kenaniah, the man who directed those who sang, wore robes of fine white linen and
sacred vests made of fine linen. David also wore a sacred vest made of white linen.
28 So all of the Israeli people joined in bringing the Sacred Chest up to Jerusalem.
They shouted joyfully, while the musicians blew horns and trumpets, and played
cymbals, lyres, and harps.
29 While they were bringing the Sacred Chest into Jerusalem, Saul’s daughter Michal
watched them, looking out of a window. When she saw King David dancing and
1 They brought the Sacred Chest to Gibeon and put it inside the Sacred Tent that
David had told his workers to set up. Then they brought offerings to be completely
burned on the altar and offerings to enable them to maintain fellowship with God.
2 When David had finished presenting all those offerings, he asked Yahweh to bless
the people.
3 He gave a loaf of bread, some dates, and some raisins to every Israeli man and
woman who was there.
4 Then David appointed some of the descendants of Levi to stand in front of the
Sacred Tent in which the Sacred Chest had been placed, to lead the people who
worshiped and thanked and praised Yahweh, the God of the Israeli people.
5 Asaph, who played the cymbals, was their leader. Zechariah was his assistant.
The other descendants of Levi who helped Asaph were Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel,
Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel. They played lyres and harps.
6 Benaiah and Jahaziel were priests who blew trumpets frequently in front of the
Sacred Tent in which was the Sacred Chest.
David’s song of praise
7 On that day, David gave to Asaph and his helpers this psalm to praise Yahweh:
8 Thank God, and pray to him [MTY].
Tell the people of all nations what he has done.
9 Sing to him; sing songs to praise him.
Tell about all his miraculous deeds.
10 Be glad that you belong to him [MTY];
those who want to know Yahweh better should rejoice.
11 Trust in Yahweh and in his power;
continually seek to get help from him.
12 Do not forget the wonderful things that he has done,
the miracles and the just laws that he has given to us.
13 We people are the descendants of his servant Jacob;
we are the people of Israel whom he has chosen.
14 Yahweh is our God.
His just/fair laws are known by people throughout the world.
15 He never forgets the agreement that he has made:
he made a promise that will last for 1,000 generations.
16 That is the agreement that he made with Abraham,
and he repeated that agreement to Isaac.
17 It was an agreement for the Israeli people,
1 CHRONICLES 16:18
602
1 CHRONICLES 16:36
and he wanted that agreement to endure forever.
18 What he said was, “I will give the Canaan region to you,
to belong to you and your descendants forever.”
19 He said that to them when there were only a few of them,
a tiny group of people who were living in that land ◄like strangers/that belonged
to other people►;
20 they continued to wander from one place to another,
from one kingdom to another.
21 But he did not allow others to oppress them,
and he warned kings by saying to them,
22 “Do not harm the people whom I have chosen!
Do not harm my prophets!”
23 You people throughout the world, sing to Yahweh.
Every day proclaim to others that he has saved us.
24 Tell the people of the nations that he is great;
He should be revered more than all the gods,
26 because all the gods that the other people-groups worship are only idols,
but Yahweh is truly great; he created the skies.
27 He is glorious and majestic;
his power and joy fill his Sacred Tent.
28 You people in nations all over the world, praise Yahweh!
Praise Yahweh for his glorious power [HEN]!
29 Praise Yahweh like he [MTY] deserves to be praised.
Bring an offering and come to his Sacred Tent.
Worship Yahweh because he is holy.
30 Everyone on the earth should tremble in front of Yahweh.
He put the earth firmly in its place; and nothing ever will be able to move/shake
it.
31 Everything in the sky and on the earth should be happy.
People everywhere should say, “Yahweh is our king!”
32 The oceans and all the creatures that are in the oceans should shout to praise him;
the fields and everything that is in them should rejoice.
33 When they do that, it will be as though the trees in the forest will sing joyfully in
front of Yahweh.
That will happen when he comes to judge everyone on [MTY] the earth.
34 Thank Yahweh, because everything that he does is
good.
He faithfully loves us forever.
35 Say to him, “God, you are the one who rescues us,
so gather us together and save us from the armies of other nations.
When you do that, we will thank you [MTY],
and we will be happy to praise you.”
36 Praise Yahweh, the God of us Israeli people,
He has always existed, and he will exist forever.
1 CHRONICLES 16:37
603
1 CHRONICLES 17:9-10
After the people finished singing that song, they all said, “◄Amen/May it be so►!”, and
they praised Yahweh.
37 Then David left Asaph and the other members of his clan there in front of the
tent in which Yahweh’s Sacred Chest had been placed. He told them that they must do
their work there every day.
38 David also left Obed-Edom and 68 other descendants of Levi to work with them.
Hosah and Obed-Edom guarded the entrances of the Sacred Tent.
39 David also told Zadok the Supreme Priest and the other priests who worked with
him to remain in front of Yahweh’s Sacred Tent, which was still at the place where
the Israeli people worshiped God there in Gibeon city.
40 Every morning and every evening they burned offerings on the altar, obeying
the rules/laws that had been written by Moses, rules/laws which Yahweh had given
to the Israeli people.
41 With them were Heman and Jeduthun and other descendants of Levi. They
[MTY] were chosen to sing songs to praise Yahweh because he faithfully loves his
people forever.
42 Heman and Jeduthun were appointed to play the trumpets and cymbals when
the other descendants of Levi sang sacred songs. The sons of Jeduthun were appointed
to guard the gates of the Sacred Tent.
43 Then all the people left. They returned to their homes, and David returned home
to ask Yahweh to bless his family.
17
Yahweh’s promise to David
1 After David began to live in his palace, he said to the prophet Nathan, “It does
not seem right that I am here living in a palace made of cedar wood, but Yahweh’s
Sacred Chest is kept inside a tent!”
God is with/guiding you.”
4 “Go and tell my servant David that this is what I, Yahweh, am saying to him:
‘You are not the one who should build a temple for me to live in.
5 I have not lived in any building, from the day that I brought the people of Israel
up out of Egypt until now. Instead, I have lived in a tent, moving from one place to
another with the Israelis when they moved to other places [DOU].
6 Wherever I went with all the Israelis as they traveled, I never [RHQ] said to any
of their leaders whom I appointed to lead [MET] them, “Why have you not built me
a temple made of cedar wood?” ’
7 Therefore, this is what you should say to my servant David: ‘I, the Almighty
Commander of the armies of angels, took you from a pasture where you were
taking care of sheep, and I appointed you to be the ruler of my Israeli people.
8 I have ◄been with/helped► you wherever you have gone, and I have gotten
rid of all your enemies as you advanced. And now I will cause you to become very
famous, as well-known as the names of the greatest men who have ever lived on the
earth.
9-10 Formerly, during the time that I appointed leaders for my Israeli people, many
violent groups oppressed them. But this will not happen any more. I have chosen a
place where my Israeli people can live peacefully and no one will disturb them any
1 CHRONICLES 17:11
604
1 CHRONICLES 17:27
more. I will give not allow them to be attacked by their enemies. And I will defeat all
your enemies.
I declare to you that I, Yahweh, will enable your descendants to rule after you
die.
11 When your life ends [EUP], and you die and go to be with your ancestors
who have died, I will appoint one of your sons to become king, and I will enable
his kingdom to ◄be strong/resist all their enemies►.
12 He is the one who will arrange for a temple to be built for me. And I will enable
his descendants to be kings [MTY] of Israel forever.
13 I will be like a father to him, and it will be as though he is a son to me. I stopped
loving Saul, the one who was the king before you became king, but I will never stop
loving your son.
14 I will cause him to rule over my people [MTY], and his kingdom will endure
forever [DOU].’ ”
15 So Nathan reported to David everything that Yahweh had revealed to him.
David’s prayer
16 Then David went into the Sacred Tent and sat in the presence of Yahweh, and
prayed this:
“Yahweh my God, I am certainly not [RHQ] worthy for you to have done all these
things for me, and my family is not worthy, either.
17 “And O God, now, in addition to everything else, you have spoken about what
will happen to my descendants in the future for many generations. Yahweh my
God, you have acted toward me as though I was the most important man on the
earth!
18 “What more can I, David, say to you for honoring me? Although you know very
well what I am like,
19 Yahweh, for my sake and because it is what you wanted to do, you have done
promising to do.
what we have always heard.
on the earth whose people you rescued. You performed great and awesome miracles,
rescuing our ancestors from being slaves in Egypt, and expelling the people of other
people-groups who were in Canaan.
22 You have caused us your Israeli people to belong to you forever, and you,
Yahweh, have become our God!
23 “And now Yahweh, I pray that you will cause the things that you have promised
to do for me and my descendants [MTY] to be fulfilled forever.
24 When that happens, you [MTY] will be famous forever. And people will exclaim,
‘The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, is the God who rules Israel!’ And
25 “You, my God, have revealed to me that you will cause some of my descendants
to become kings. So I am brave enough to pray like this to you.
26 Yahweh, you are God! You have promised to do these good things for me.
27 And now you, Yahweh, have promised to bless my descendants [MTY], in order
that they will continue to rule forever. That will happen because you, Yahweh, are
the one who has blessed them, and you will keep blessing them forever.”

David’s military victories
1 Some time later, David’s army attacked the army of Philistia and defeated them.
They captured Gath city and the surrounding villages.
2 His army also defeated the army of the Moab people-group. The people were forced
to accept David as their ruler, and also to pay money each year to David’s government,
in order that David’s army would protect them.
3 David’s army also fought against the army of Hadadezer, the king of the Zobah
region in Syria near Hamath city, when Hadadezer was trying to establish control
over the area near the Euphrates River.
4 David’s army captured 1,000 of Hadadezer’s chariots, 7,000 chariot-drivers, and
20,000 soldiers. They hamstrung/crippled most of their horses; there were only 100
horses that they did not cripple.
5 When the army of Syria came from Damascus city to help Hadadezer’s army,
David’s soldiers killed 22,000 of them.
6 Then David stationed groups of his soldiers in Damascus, and the people of Syria
were forced to accept David as their ruler, and to pay to David’s government each
year the payment/tax that he demanded. And Yahweh enabled David’s army to win
battles everywhere they went.
7 David soldiers took the gold shields that were carried by the officers of
Hadadezer’s army and brought them to Jerusalem.
8 They also brought from Tebah (OR, Tibhath) and Cun, two towns that belonged to
Hadadezer, a lot of bronze, which David’s son Solomon later used to make the huge
bronze basin and the pillars and other bronze items for the temple.
9 When Tou, the king of Hamath city in Syria, heard that David’s army had defeated
10 he sent his son Hadoram to King David, to greet him and ◄congratulate him/
fighting the army of Tou. Hadoram brought to David many items/gifts made of gold,
11 King David dedicated those things to Yahweh, like he had done with the silver and
the Ammon people-group and from the people of Philistia, and from the descendants
of Amalek.
12 One of David’s army commanders, Abishai, whose mother was Zeruiah, went with
his army and killed 18,000 soldiers from Edom in the Salt Valley.
13 Then David stationed groups of his soldiers there in Edom, and the people
of Edom were forced to accept David as their king and to pay money to David’s
government every year. And Yahweh enabled David’s army to win battles wherever
they went.
David’s officials
14 David ruled over all the Israeli people, and he always did for them what was just
and fair.
15 Zeruiah’s son Joab was the chief army commander. Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud
was the record-keeper.
16 Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were the Supreme
Priests. Shavsha was the official secretary.
17 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ruled over the Kereth and Peleth groups who were
David’s bodyguards. And David’s sons were his most important officials.

The battle against the Ammon people-group
1 Some time later, Nahash, the king of the Ammon people-group, died. Then his son
Hanun became their king.
2 When David heard about that, he thought to himself, “Nahash was kind to me, so I
will be kind to his son.” So David sent some officials there, to tell Hanun that he was
sorry to hear that Hanun’s father had died.
But when David’s officials came to Hanun in the land where the Ammon peoplegroup lived,
3 the leaders of the Ammon people-group said to Hanun, “Do you think that it is
really to honor your father that King David is sending these men to say that he is
sorry that your father died? We think that his men have come to ◄look around/spy►
our city in order to determine how his army can conquer us.”
4 Hanun believed what they said, so he commanded some soldiers to seize the officials
whom David had sent, and shave off their beards, and insult them by cutting off the
lower part of their robes, and then send them away. So his soldiers did that.
5 The officials were greatly humiliated/ashamed. When David found out about what
had happened to his officials, he sent some messengers to them to tell them, “Stay at
Jericho until your beards have grown again, and then return home.”
6 Then the leaders of the Ammon people-group realized that they had greatly
insulted [IDM] David. So Hanun and some of his officials sent about ◄37,000 pounds/
34,000 kg.► of silver to hire chariots and chariot-drivers from the Aram-Naharaim,
7 They hired 32,000 chariots and chariot-drivers, as well as the king of the Maacah
region. The soldiers from the Ammon people-group also marched out and ◄stood in
their positions/arranged themselves for battle► at the entrance to their capital city,
Rabbah.
8 When David heard about that, he sent Joab and all his army.
9 The soldiers of the Ammon people-group came out of their city and lined up for
battle at the entrance to their capital city, Rabbah. Meanwhile, the other kings who
had come with their armies stood in their positions in the open fields.
10 Joab saw that there were groups of enemy soldiers in front of his troops and
behind his troops. So he selected some of the best Israeli troops and put them in
positions to fight against the soldiers of Syria.
11 He appointed his older brother Abishai to be the commander of his other soldiers
and he told them to ◄stand in their positions/arrange themselves► in front of the army
of the Ammon people-group.
12 Joab said to them, “If the soldiers from Syria are too strong for us to defeat
them, then your soldiers must come and help us. But if the soldiers from the Ammon
people-group are too strong for you to defeat them, then my soldiers will come and
help your men.
13 We must be strong/courageous, and fight hard to defend our people and our cities
◄that belong to/where we worship► our God. I will pray that Yahweh will do what
he considers to be good.”
14 So Joab and his troops advanced to fight the army of Syria, and the soldiers from
Syria ran away from them.
15 And when the soldiers of the Ammon people-group saw that the soldiers from
Syria were running away, they also started to run away from Abishai and his army,
and they retreated back inside the city. So Joab and his army returned to Jerusalem.
1 CHRONICLES 19:16
607
1 CHRONICLES 20:8
16 After the leaders of the army of Syria realized that they had been defeated by the
army of Israel, they sent messengers to another part of Syria on the east side of the
Euphrates river, and brought troops from there to the battle area, with Shophach, the
commander of Hadadezer’s army, leading them.
17 When David heard about that, he gathered all the Israeli soldiers, and they
crossed the Jordan River. They advanced and took their battle positions to attack
the army of Syria.
18 But the army of Syria ran away from the soldiers of Israel. However, David’s
soldiers killed 7,000 of their chariot-drivers and 40,000 other soldiers. They also killed
Shophach, their army commander.
19 When the kings who had been ruled by Hadadezer realized that they had been
defeated by the Israeli army, they made peace with David, and agreed to allow him
to rule them.
So the rulers of Syria did not want to help the rulers of the Ammon people-group
any more.
David’s army captured the capital city of Ammon
1 In that region, kings usually went with their armies to fight their enemies ◄in the
springtime/when the cold season ended►. But that year, David did not do that. Instead,
he stayed in Jerusalem, and he sent his commander Joab to lead the army. Joab took
his troops. They crossed the Jordan River and ruined the land of the Ammon peoplegroup. Then they went to Rabbah, the capital city, and surrounded it. David stayed
in Jerusalem for a while. But later he took more troops and went to help Joab. Their
armies attacked Rabbah and destroyed it.
2 Then David took the crown from the head of the king of Rabbah (OR, from the
head of their god Milcom) and put it on his own head. It was very heavy; it weighed
◄75 pounds/34 kg.►, and it had many very valuable stones fastened to it. They also
took many other valuable things from the city.
army, using saws and iron picks and axes. David’s soldiers did this in all the cities of
Wars against the giants in Philistia
4 Later, David’s army fought a battle with the army of Philistia, at Gezer city. During
the battle Sibbecai, from Hushah clan, killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the
Rapha giants. So the armies of Philistia were defeated.
5 In another battle against the soldiers of Philistia, Elhanan, the son of Jair, killed
which was as thick as a weaver’s rod.
6 There was another battle near Gath. A ◄huge man/giant► was there who had six
fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. He was descended from the Rapha
giants.
7 When he made fun of the soldiers of Israel, Jonathan, the son of David’s older
brother Shimea, killed him.
8 Those were some of the descendants of the Rapha giants who had lived in Gath,
who were killed [MTY] by David and his soldiers.
21
David commanded that the soldiers be counted
1 CHRONICLES 21:1
608
1 CHRONICLES 21:17
1 Satan decided to cause the Israeli people to have trouble. So he incited David to
find out how many men in Israel were able to be in the army.
2 So David commanded Joab and the other army commanders, “Count all the men
in Israel who are able to be in the army. Start at Beersheba town in the south and go
all the way to Dan city in the north. Then come back and report to me, in order that
I may know how many men there are.”
many soldiers as we have now, you would [RHQ] still rule all of them. So why do you
sinning.”
4 But David would not change his mind. So Joab and his soldiers went everywhere
in Israel and in Judah, and counted the people. Then they returned to Jerusalem,
5 and they reported to David that there were 1,100,000 men in Israel who could be
in the army, and 470,000 in Judah.
6 Joab did not count the men from the tribes of Levi and Benjamin, because he was
disgusted with what the king had commanded.
God punished the people of Israel
7 David’s command to count the people caused God to become angry, so he told
David that he had decided to punish the people of Israel.
8 Then David prayed, saying, “Yahweh, what I did was very foolish. I have sinned
greatly by what I have done. So now I plead with you, please forgive me.”
9 Then Yahweh said to Gad, David’s prophet,
10 “Go and tell this to David: I am allowing you to choose one of three things to
punish you. I will do whichever one you choose.”
11 So Gad went to David and said to him, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘You can
choose one of these punishments:
12 three years of famine in Israel, or three months during which your armies will
run away from their enemies who will attack them with swords, or three days during
which I will send my angel to cause many people in the country to die because of a
◄plague/very serious illness►.’ So, you must decide what I will say to answer Yahweh,
the one who sent me.”
13 David replied to Gad, “I am very distressed. But allow Yahweh to punish [MTY]
me, because he is very merciful. Do not allow humans to punish me, because they
will not be merciful.”
14 So Yahweh sent a plague on the people of Israel, and 70,000 of them died because
of it.
15 And God sent an angel to destroy the people in Jerusalem by the plague. But when
the angel was standing at the ground where Araunah, from the Jebus people-group,
threshed grain, Yahweh saw all the suffering that the people had endured, and he
was grieved. So he said to the angel, “Stop what you are doing [IDM]! That is enough
[IDM]!”
16 David looked up and saw the angel whom Yahweh had sent, standing between
the sky and the ground. The angel had a sword in his hand that was pointed toward
Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of the city, who were wearing clothes made of
rough sackcloth, prostrated themselves on the ground.
17 David said to God, “I am [RHQ] the one who ordered the men who could be in
the army to be counted. I am the one who has sinned and done what is very wrong,
but these people are as innocent as [MET] sheep. They have certainly not [RHQ] done
anything that is wrong. So Yahweh my God, punish [IDM] me and my family, but do
1 CHRONICLES 21:18
609
1 CHRONICLES 22:4
18 Then the angel who was sent by Yahweh told Gad to go up to the place where
Araunah threshed grain and tell David to build an altar to worship Yahweh there.
19 So after Gad told David, he obeyed the message that Yahweh [MTY] had given to
Gad, and he went up there.
20 While Araunah was threshing some wheat, he turned and saw the angel. His
four sons who were with him also saw the angel, and they hid themselves.
21 Then David approached. When Araunah saw him, he left the place where he was
threshing grain and prostrated himself, with his face touching the ground.
22 David said to him, “Please sell me your threshing place in order that I can build
an altar here to worship Yahweh. Then he will stop this plague. I will pay the full
price.”
23 Araunah replied, “Take it! Your majesty, do whatever you want to. I will give you
And I will give you the threshing boards to use as wood on the altar, and I will give
24 But the king said to Araunah, “No, I will not take these things as a gift. I will pay
me nothing and offer them as sacrifices to Yahweh to be completely burned on the
altar.”
25 So David paid Araunah 600 pieces of gold for the whole area.
26 David built an altar to worship Yahweh there, and he offered sacrifices to be
completely burned on the altar and sacrifices to restore fellowship with Yahweh.
David prayed to Yahweh, and Yahweh answered by sending a fire from heaven to
burn up the offerings on the altar.
27 Then Yahweh spoke to the angel, and told him to put his sword back into its
sheath. So the angel did that.
28 And when David saw that Yahweh had answered him there at the place where
Araunah threshed grain and had ended the plague, he offered sacrifices there.
29 Yahweh’s Sacred Tent, which Moses had commanded to be set up in the desert,
and the altar for burning sacrifices completely, were at that time on a hill at Gibeon
city.
30 But David did not want to go there to request God to tell him what he wanted
him to do, because he was afraid that the angel sent from Yahweh might strike him
with his sword.
22
1 Then David said, “Here, at the edge of Jerusalem, is where we will build the temple
for our God Yahweh, and where we will make the altar for burning the offerings that
the Israeli people will bring.”
The preparations for the temple
2 So David commanded that the foreigners who lived in Israel must gather together.
When they did that, he appointed some of those men to cut huge stones from the
quarries and to smooth their surfaces, to be used to build the temple of God.
3 David provided a large amount of iron for making nails and hinges for the doors
in the gates of the temple. He also provided so much bronze for making the altar and
various utensils, that no one could weigh it all.
4 He also provided money for buying a large amount of cedar logs. Because there
was a huge number of them, no one was able to count them. Those were logs that
men from Tyre and Sidon cities sent to David.
1 CHRONICLES 22:5
610
1 CHRONICLES 22:19
5 David provided all those things because he thought, “My son Solomon is still young
and he does not know what he needs to know about building, and the temple of
Yahweh must be ◄magnificent/very beautiful►. It must be a glorious building that
will become famous, and people throughout the world must consider it to be glorious/
splendid. So now I will begin to prepare for it to be built, and Solomon will be
responsible for building it.” So David collected a great amount of building materials
before he died.
arrange for a temple to be built for Yahweh, the God whom the Israelis worshiped.
God.
8 But Yahweh told a prophet to tell me, ‘You have killed many men [MTY] in the
battles that you have fought. I have seen the blood of all the people whom you killed,
so you will not be the one who will arrange for a temple to be built to honor me
[MTY].
9 But you will have a son who will be king of Israel after you die. He will be a man
who is peaceful and quiet, not a man who kills others. And I will cause that there will
be peace between him and his enemies who are in all the nearby lands. His name
will be Solomon, which sounds like the word for peace. During the time that he is king,
people in Israel will be peaceful and safe.
10 He is the one who will arrange for a temple to be built to honor me [MTY]. He
will be like a son to me, and I will cause some of his descendants to rule [MTY] over
Israel forever [HYP].’
11 “So now, my son, I hope/wish that Yahweh will help you, and enable you to be
successful in arranging for building the temple of Yahweh, your God, which is what
he said that you would do.
12 I also hope/wish that he will enable you to be wise and to understand what you
need to know, and enable you to obey his laws while you rule over Israel.
13 If you carefully obey all the laws and regulations/commands that Yahweh gave
to Moses to give to us Israeli people, you will be successful. So be steadfast/strong
and courageous. Do not be afraid of anything, and do not become discouraged!
14 “I have tried hard to provide materials for building the temple of Yahweh. I
have provided nearly 4,000 tons of gold, and nearly 40,000 tons of silver. I have also
provided a very large amount of iron and bronze; no one has been able to weigh it
all. I have also gathered/provided lumber and stone for the walls of the temple, but
you may need to get some more of those things.
15 There are many men in Israel who have good ability to cut big stones for making
stone walls, and carpenters, and men who are very skilled at making various kinds
of things.
16 There are many men who know how to make things from gold and silver and
bronze and iron. So now I say to you, begin the work of building the temple, and I
hope/wish that Yahweh will help/be with you.”
17 Then David commanded that all the Israeli leaders must assist Solomon. He said
to them,
18 “Yahweh our God is certainly with/helping you [RHQ]. He has allowed you to
have peace with all the nearby nations [RHQ]. He has enabled my army to conquer
[IDM] them, so now Yahweh and my people control them.
19 Now you must obey Yahweh completely. Help Solomon to arrange for building
the temple for Yahweh God, in order that you can bring the Sacred Chest that contains
the Ten Commandments and the other sacred items that belong to God into the temple
that you will build to honor Yahweh.”

The duties of the descendants of Levi
2 David gathered the leaders of Israel and the priests and other descendants of Levi.
least thirty years old, and they found out that there were 38,000 of them.
4 Then David said, “From those 38,000 men, I want 24,000 of them to supervise the
work at the temple of Yahweh, and I want 6,000 of them to be officials and judges.
5 I want 4,000 to be guards at the gates, and 4,000 to praise Yahweh, using the
musical instruments that I have provided for them.”
6 David divided the descendants of Levi into three family groups; each group
consisted of men who were descendants of one of the three sons of Levi—Gershon,
Kohath, and Merari.
The descendants of Gershon
7 From the descendants of Gershon there were Ladan and Shimei.
8 There were three sons of Ladan: Jehiel was the oldest, and his younger brothers
Zetham and Joel.
9 There were three of the sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran.
They were all leaders of the clans of Ladan.
10 There were four men who were other sons of Shimei:
11 Jahath, who was his oldest son, and his younger brothers Ziza, Jeush, and
Beriah.
Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were counted as though they
were one family.
The descendants of Kohath
12 Kohath had four sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
13 There were two sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses.
Aaron and his descendants were set apart to dedicate the very holy things, to
offer sacrifices to Yahweh, to serve in his presence, and to declare to the people
what Yahweh [MTY] would do to bless them. They were to do those things
forever.
14 The sons of Moses, the man who served God well, were counted as part of the
tribe of Levi.
15 The sons of Moses were Gershom and Eliezer.
16 The oldest son of Gershom was Shubael.
17 Rehabiah was the oldest son of Eliezer.
Eliezer had no other sons, but Rehabiah had many sons.
18 The oldest son of Izhar was Shelomith.
19 Hebron had four sons.
Jeriah was his oldest son, and his younger brothers were Amariah, Jahaziel, and
Jekameam.
20 Uzziel had two sons.
Micah was the oldest son, and his younger brother was Isshiah.
The descendants of Merari
21 Merari had two sons: Mahli and Mushi.
The sons of Mahli were Eleazar and Kish.
22 Eleazar had no sons; he had only daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish,
married them.
1 CHRONICLES 24:7
24 Those were the descendants of Levi, whose names were listed according to their
families/clans. They were chosen for special jobs by ◄casting lots/throwing small
marked stones►. Each person who was at least 20 years old was listed. They all
worked in the temple of Yahweh.
25 David had said previously, “Yahweh, the God to whom we Israeli people belong,
has enabled us to have peace, and he has come to live in Jerusalem forever.
26 Therefore, the descendants of Levi no longer need to carry the Sacred Tent and
the items used in the work there.”
27 Obeying the final instructions of David before he died, instructions for doing this
work at the temple, they counted only the descendants of Levi who were at least 20
years old.
28 The work of those descendants of Levi was to assist the descendants of Aaron in
their work in the temple of Yahweh: To be in charge of the temple courtyards and
the side rooms, the ceremonies for purifying all the sacred things, and to do other
work at the temple.
29 They were also in charge of the sacred loaves of bread that were placed each
week on the table in the temple, the flour for the grain offerings, the wafers that were
made without yeast, and the measuring the ingredients and mixing them and baking
that bread and those wafers.
30 They were also told to stand every morning at the temple and thank Yahweh and
praise him. They were also required to do the same thing every evening.
31 And they were to do the same thing whenever offerings that were to be
completely burned on the altar were presented/offered to Yahweh on Sabbath days
and during the new moon celebrations and other religious festivals. They were told
how many of them should be there and what they should do each time.
32 So the descendants of Levi did the work that was assigned to them by their fellow
Israelis who were descendants of Aaron. They did that work in the area surrounding
the Sacred Tent, and in the Sacred Tent, and later at the temple.
The duties of the priests
24
1 These are the groups of the descendants of Aaron the first Supreme Priest: Aaron’s
four sons were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father died, and they had no children. So
their younger brothers Eleazar and Ithamar became the priests.
3 Zadok, who was a descendant of Eleazar, and Ahimelech, who was a descendant
of Ithamar, helped David to separate his descendants into two groups. Each group
had certain duties.
4 There were more leaders among the descendants of Eleazar than there were
among the descendants of Ithamar. So they appointed 16 leaders from Eleazar’s
descendants and eight leaders from Ithamar’s descendants.
5 There were temple officials and priests, including descendants of both Eleazar
and Ithamar, to make sure that the work was divided fairly. So they decided what
6 Shemaiah, the son of Nethanel, who was a descendant of Levi, wrote down the
the Supreme Priest, and Ahimelech his assistant, and the leaders of the families of the

marked stones.

The other descendants of Levi
20 This is a list of some of the other descendants of Levi:
Amram was the ancestor of Shubael and Jehdeiah.
21 Rehabiah was the ancestor of Isshiah, the oldest son in his family.

like their fellow Israelis, the descendants of Aaron, did. They cast lots {The lots were
cast} while King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the leaders of the families of the priests
and the other descendants of Levi watched. They gave the same jobs to the families

The duties that David assigned to the musicians
1 David and some of the temple officials (OR, army commanders) chose some of the
descendants of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun to be in charge of proclaiming God’s
messages, and to play harps and lyres and cymbals. This is a list of the men whom
they chose for that work:
2 From the sons of Asaph they chose Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Aserelah. Asaph
supervised them. And the king appointed Asaph to proclaim God’s messages.
3 From the sons of Jeduthun they chose six men: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei,
Hashabiah, and Mattithiah. Jeduthun supervised them and also proclaimed God’s
messages, playing his harp while he thanked and praised Yahweh.
4 From the sons of Heman, who was one of the king’s prophets, they chose Bukkiah,
Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shubael, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti,
Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth.
5 God promised to cause Heman to be strong, so altogether, God have him 14 sons
and three daughters.
6 All those men were supervised by their fathers while they played music in the
temple of Yahweh. They played cymbals, lyres, and harps. And their fathers—Asaph,
Jeduthun and Heman—were supervised by the king.
7 Those men and their relatives were all trained and skilled for playing musical
instruments in the temple. That was their work for Yahweh. Including their relatives,
there were 288 of them.
8 All of them, including ones who were young and those who were old, cast lots to
determine what work they would do.
9 From the family of Asaph, the first ones selected were Joseph and 12 of his sons
and relatives.

The guards of the temple gates
615
1 CHRONICLES 26:21
26
1 This is a list of the groups of men who guarded the temple gates:
From the descendants of Korah, there was Meshelemiah, the son of Kore, who was
one of the sons of Asaph.
2 The oldest son of Meshelemiah was Zechariah. His other sons were Jediael,
Zebadiah, Jathniel,
3 Elam, Jehohanan, and Eliehoenai.
His oldest son was Shemaiah. His other sons were Jehozabad, Joah, Sacar,
Nethanel,
5 Ammiel, Issachar, and Peullethai. It was because God had blessed him that he
had many sons.
6 Obed-Edom’s son Shemaiah also had sons. They were leaders in their father’s
family because they were capable of doing many things well.
7 The sons of Shemaiah were Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad. Shemaiah’s
relatives Elihu and Semakiah were also capable men.
8 All of those descendants of Obed-Edom and their sons and relatives were
capable people and strong workers. Altogether there were 62 of them.
9 Another guard was Meshelemiah. He and his sons and relatives were also capable
people. There were 18 of them altogether.
10 Another guard was Hosah’s son Shimri, a descendant of Merari. Hosah appointed
Shimri to be the leader, even though he was not Hosah’s oldest son.
11 Hosah’s other sons were Hilkiah, Tabaliah, and Zechariah. Altogether there were

been dedicated to Yahweh by King David, by the leaders of the family groups, by the
army commanders of 1,000 soldiers and commanders of 100 soldiers, and by other
army commanders.
27 Some of the things that those army officers had taken from Israel’s enemies in
battles they dedicated for the repair of the temple of Yahweh.
28 And Shelomith and his relatives were also in charge of everything that had been
dedicated to Yahweh by the prophet Samuel, by King Saul, and by David’s two army
commanders Ner and Joab.

Those were the leaders over the tribes of Israel.
23 When David told Joab to count the men of Israel, he did not tell him to count the
men who were less then 20 years old, because Yahweh had promised many years
previously that there would be as many people in Israel as there are stars in the sky.
24 Joab and his helpers started to count the men of Israel, but they did not finish
counting them because Joab knew that Yahweh was angry about their being counted.
Yahweh punished [MTY] the people of Israel because of this counting, and as a result
the total number of Israeli men able to serve in the army was not written on the scroll
about King David’s rule.

David’s instructions to Solomon for building the temple
1 David summoned all the leaders of Israel to come to Jerusalem.
He summoned
the leaders of the tribes, the leaders/commanders of the groups that worked for the
king, the commanders of 100 soldiers, the commanders of 1,000 soldiers, those who
were in charge of the property and livestock that belonged to the king and his sons,
all the palace officials, and his mighty soldiers and bravest warriors.
2 David stood up and said, “My fellow Israelis, listen to me. I wanted [IDM] to build
a temple to be a place where we would put the Sacred Chest of Yahweh, where it
would stay permanently. And I made plans to build it.
3 But God said to me, ‘You are not the one who will arrange to build a temple for me
[MTY], because you are a warrior and you have killed many people [MTY] in battles.’
4 “But Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelis belong, had chosen me and my
descendants to be the kings of Israel forever. First he chose the tribe of Judah, and
from the people [MTY] of Judah he chose my family, and from my father’s sons he
chose me to be the king over all of Israel.
5 Yahweh has given me many sons, but from them he chose my son Solomon to be
the next king to rule [MTY] the kingdom of Israel.
6 He said to me, ‘Solomon your son is the one who will arrange to build my temple
and the courtyards around it, because I have chosen him to be like my son and I will
be like [MET] his father.
7 I will enable his kingdom to endure forever if he continues to obey my laws and
commands, like you are doing now.’
8 “So now, while all you people of Israel, all of you who belong to Yahweh, are
watching, and while God is listening, I command you leaders to carefully obey all the
commands of Yahweh our God, in order that you may continue to possess this good
land and enable your descendants to inherit it forever.
9 “And you, my son Solomon, must know God like I know him, and you must serve
him faithfully and because you want to. You must do that because he knows what
1 CHRONICLES 28:10
619
1 CHRONICLES 29:2
everyone is thinking and he understands the reasons that people do what they do. If
will abandon/reject you forever.
what I have said, and be strong and do what he is wanting you to do.”
11 Then David gave to his son Solomon the scroll on which were written the plans
for the main rooms of the temple, its porch, its storerooms, all the other upper and
lower rooms, and the Very Holy Place where God would forgive the sins that people
had committed.
12 David wrote for him the plans that God’s Spirit had put into his mind for building
the courtyards and all the rooms that surrounded the temple, including the room
where the money and other valuable things that were dedicated to God would be
kept.
13 He gave Solomon instructions for the groups of priests and other descendants of
Levi, about all the work that they must do to serve in Yahweh’s temple, and about
14 He wrote down how much gold and how much silver should be used to make all
the items in the temple:
15 how much gold for making the gold lampstands and the lamps, how much silver
to make the silver lamps and lampstands,
16 how much gold for making the table on which the priests would put the sacred
bread, how much silver to use to make the other tables,
17 how much pure gold for the meat forks and the bowls and the cups, how much
gold for each gold dish, how much silver for each silver dish,
18 and how much pure gold to make the altar for burning incense. He also gave to
Solomon his plans for making the golden statues of winged creatures that would be
above the Sacred Chest of Yahweh, like a chariot for him.
19 Then David said, “I have written all these plans while Yahweh was directing
[MTY] me. He has enabled me to understand all the details of his plan for the temple
that is to be built.”
20 David also said to his son Solomon, “Be strong and courageous, and do this work.
Do not be afraid or discouraged, because Yahweh our God will be with/helping you.
He will not fail to help you or abandon you until you finish all the work of making
his temple.
21 The groups of priests and other descendants of Levi are ready to begin their work
at the temple, and every man who has a special skill will help you in all the work.
And my officials and the other people will obey you, whatever you command them
to do.”
29
Gifts for building the temple
1 Then King David said to all the people who had gathered there, “My son Solomon,
the one whom God has chosen to be the next king, is young and does not have much
experience. This work of building the temple is great/important, because this glorious
building will not be to honor people, but to honor Yahweh our God.
2 From all the things that I possess, I have provided what will be needed to build the
temple of my God—the gold for the things to be made of gold, the silver for the things
to be made of silver, bronze for the things to be made of bronze, iron for the things
to be made of iron, wood for the things to be made of wood, and large amounts of
1 CHRONICLES 29:3
kinds of valuable stones.
3 In addition to all these things that I have given for the temple, I am giving treasures
of gold and silver, because I very much desire that this holy temple for my God be
built.
4 I am giving 110 tons of gold from Ophir and 260 tons of refined silver to cover the
walls of the buildings,
5 for making the other items of gold and silver, and for the other work to be done
by the craftsmen. So now, I ask you, are there others willing to show by contributing
other gifts for the building of the temple [EUP] that they have dedicated themselves to
Yahweh?”
6 Then the leaders of the families/clans, the leaders of the tribes of Israel, the
commanders of 1,000 soldiers and the commanders of 100 soldiers, and the officials
who supervised the work that the king wanted done, gave gifts ◄willingly/because
they wanted to give them►.
7 For the work at the temple they gave 190 tons and ◄185 pounds/84 kg.► of gold,
375 tons of silver, 675 tons of bronze, and 3,750 tons of iron.
8 And any people who owned valuable stones gave them to be put in the storeroom
of the temple. Jehiel, a descendant of Gershon, was appointed to be in charge of them.
9 The people were happy to see that their leaders wanted to give those things,
because they knew that their leaders were happy and enthusiastic to give those things
to Yahweh. And King David also was very happy.
David’s prayer
10 Then, while all the people there were listening, David prayed, saying,
“We praise you, Yahweh,
the God whom our ancestor Jacob worshiped.
We will praise you forever!
11 You alone are great and powerful;
only you are truly glorious and majestic and wonderful.
And that is true because everything in heaven and on the earth is yours.
You are the king of all the people in this world;
you are the ruler of everything.
12 Because you are very powerful [DOU],
you are able to cause anyone to be great and strong.
13 So now, our God, we thank you,
and we praise you [MTY] for being very great.
14 But my people and I are not really able to give anything to you,
because everything that we have comes from you,
and what we have given to you are only the things that we have received from
you [MTY].
15 In this land we are like [MET] foreigners and strangers, like our ancestors were.
Our time here on this earth is like [SIM] a shadow that disappears quickly;
we know that there is nothing that can enable us to escape dying.
16 Yahweh our God, we have gathered all these things to use in building your [MTY]
temple,
but all of it really belongs to you, and you have given it to us [MTY].
17 My God, I know that you test us people,
and you are pleased if you find out that we do what is right.
All these things I have given to you because I wanted to.
1 CHRONICLES 29:18
621
1 CHRONICLES 29:30
And now I have seen that your people have also joyfully and generously given
things to you.
18 Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob worshiped,
I desire/hope that your people will continue to desire to do things like this forever,
and that they will always be loyal to you.
19 And now, please enable my son Solomon to faithfully and sincerely [DOU] obey
your commands and laws and decrees [DOU]
and to do everything that is needed to build this beautiful building
for which I have provided all these things.”
20 Then David said to all the people who were gathered there, “Praise Yahweh our
God!” So they all praised Yahweh the God whom their ancestors ◄also worshiped/
belonged to►. They prostrated themselves on the ground in front of Yahweh and in
front of the king.
Solomon was crowned to become the king
21 The next day the people offered sacrifices to Yahweh.
They presented many
animals to be completely burned on the altar: 1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, 1,000 male
sheep, plus offerings of wine, and many other sacrifices on behalf of all the people of
Israel.
22 On that day the people were joyful and ate and drank while Yahweh was
watching.
Then for the second time they declared that Solomon was now the king. While
Yahweh was watching, they anointed him with olive oil to be the king, and they
anointed Zadok to be the Supreme Priest.
23 So Solomon sat on the throne because Yahweh wanted him to be the king to
succeed his father David. During the following years Solomon prospered, and all
the Israeli people obeyed him.
24 King David’s other sons and all the officers and mighty warriors accepted
Solomon as their king, and they solemnly promised to obey him.
25 Yahweh caused Solomon to be highly respected by all the Israeli people, and they
honored him very much. No king of Israel was honored as much as Solomon was.
The death of David
26 Jesse’s son David was the king who ruled all of Israel.
27 He ruled for 40 years: Seven years in Hebron city and 33 years in Jerusalem.
28 He became an old man who was very rich and greatly honored by all the people.
Then he died, and his son Solomon became the king of Israel.
29 A record of all the things that King David did while he ruled, from the beginning
to the end, was put on scrolls written by the prophets Samuel, Nathan, and Gad.
30 They told about his powerful rule [HEN], and all the things that happened to him
and to the people of Israel and in the nearby kingdoms while he was ruling Israel.
2 CHRONICLES 1:1
622
2 CHRONICLES 1:14
Solomon and of the other kings of Judah until the
1 David’s son King Solomon was able to gain complete control over his kingdom,
because Yahweh his God helped him and enabled him to become very powerful.
2-5 When David was king, he had arranged for a new Sacred Tent to be made in
Jerusalem. Then David and the Israeli leaders had brought God’s Sacred Chest from
Kiriath-Jearim city to the new Sacred Tent in Jerusalem that he had prepared for it.
But when Solomon became the king, the first Sacred Tent was still at Gibeon city. That
was the tent that Moses, the man who served God well, had arranged to be made in
the desert. And the bronze altar that Bezalel, the son of Uri and grandson of Hur, had
made was also still in Gibeon, in front of the first Sacred Tent.
One day Solomon summoned the army commanders of 1,000 soldiers and the
commanders of 100 soldiers and the judges and all the other leaders in Israel. He
told them to go with him to Gibeon. So they all went to a hill in Gibeon where the
Sacred Tent was, and Solomon and all the others with him worshiped Yahweh there.
6 Then Solomon went up to the bronze altar in front of the Sacred Tent, and he
offered 1,000 animals to be killed and completely burned on the altar.
7 That night God appeared to Solomon in a dream and said to him, “Request
whatever you want me to give to you.”
8 Solomon replied, “You were very kind to David my father, and now you have
appointed me to be the king to succeed him.
9 So Yahweh my God, you have caused me to become the king to rule people who
David.
10 Please enable me to be wise and to know what I should do, in order that I may
rule these people well, because there is no one who can rule all this great nation of
yours without your help.”
11 God replied, “I am pleased with what you desire; you have not requested a huge
amount of money or to be honored or that your enemies be killed. And you have not
requested that you live for a long time. Instead, you have requested that I enable you
to be wise and to know what you should do in order that you may govern well my
people whom I have appointed you to rule.
12 Therefore I will enable you to be wise and to know what you should do to rule
my people well. But I will also enable you to have a huge amount of money and to
be honored, more than anyone who was previously a king ever was honored, more
than anyone who later becomes king will be honored.”
13 Then Solomon and the people who were with him all left from being in front of
he Sacred Tent on the hill in Gibeon, and they returned to Jerusalem. From there he
ruled the Israeli people.
Solomon’s wealth
14 Solomon acquired 1,400 chariots and 12,000 men who rode on horses.
He put
some of the chariots and horses in Jerusalem, and put some of them in various other
cities.
2 CHRONICLES 1:15
15 During the years that Solomon was king, silver and gold were as common in
Jerusalem as stones, and lumber from cedar trees were as plentiful as lumber from
ordinary sycamore trees in the foothills.
16 Solomon’s horses were imported/brought from Egypt and from the Kue region in
Turkey.
17 In Egypt his men paid 15 pounds of silver for each chariot and 3-3/4 pounds of
silver for each horse. They also exported/sold many of them to the kings of the Heth
and Aram people-groups.
2
Preparations for building the temple
1 Solomon ordered that a temple should be built where Yahweh would be worshiped
and also that a palace should be built for himself.
2 He selected 70,000 men to carry the building supplies and 80,000 men to cut stones
◄from quarries/walls of rock► in the hills. He also chose 3,600 men to supervise them.
3 Solomon sent this message to King Hiram of Tyre city:
“Many years ago when my father David was building his palace, you sent to him
cedar logs. Will you send me cedar logs, too?
4 “We are about to build a temple where we will worship Yahweh our God. We
want to dedicate it to be a place where we will burn fragrant incense to honor him,
and a place to put loaves of sacred bread, and for making sacrifices every morning
and every evening and every Sabbath day, and to celebrate on the day of every new
moon and at other special religious festivals to honor Yahweh our God. We want
to do those things forever, like Yahweh has commanded.
5 We want this temple to be a great temple, because our God is greater than all
other gods.
6 But no one can really build a temple that would be big enough for God to live
in, because even the highest heavens are not big enough for him. And I am worthy
only to build a place where we can burn sacrifices to him.
7 Therefore, please send me a man who knows well how to make things from gold
and silver and bronze and iron, and to make things from purple and red and blue
cloth. He should also know well how to engrave designs. I want him to work in
Jerusalem and in other places in Judah with my skilled craftsmen, the ones whom
my father David appointed.
8 I know that your workers are skilled in cutting timber, so also please send me
cedar logs, pine logs, and juniper logs from the Lebanon mountains. My workers
will work with your workers.
9 In that way, those workers will provide me with plenty of lumber. We will need
plenty, because I want the temple that we will build to be large and beautiful.
10 I will pay your workers, the men who cut the logs, 100,000 bushels of ground
wheat, 100,000 bushels of barley, 110,000 gallons of wine, and 110,000 gallons of olive
oil.”
11 When Hiram received that message, he replied by sending this message to
Solomon:
“Because Yahweh loves his people, he has appointed you to be their king.”
12 And Hiram added,
the sky and the earth! He has given King David a wise son, one who is very smart/
for Yahweh and a palace for himself.
2 CHRONICLES 2:13
624
2 CHRONICLES 3:11-12
13 “I will be sending to you Huram-Abi, a man who is very skilled.
14 His mother was from the tribe of Dan, and his father was from here in Tyre.
He is very able to make things from gold and silver and bronze and iron and stone
and wood, but he also makes nice things from purple and blue and red cloth, and he
does all kinds of engraving. He can make things using any design/pattern that you
give to him. He will work with your craftsmen, and the craftsmen who did work for
your father, King David.
15 “Now please send us the wheat and barley and olive oil and wine that you
promised to send to us.
16 When you do that, my workers will cut from trees in the Lebanon mountains
all the logs that you need and bring them down to the sea. Then we will tie the logs
together to form rafts with them, and float them in the sea to Joppa city. From there,
you can arrange for them to be taken up to Jerusalem.
17 Solomon told his workers to count all the people from other countries who were
living in Israel, similar to what his father David had done. There were 153,600 of
them.
18 Solomon assigned 70,000 of them to carry materials, and 80,000 to cut stone from
quarries in the hills, and 3,600 of them to supervise the others and be sure that they
worked steadily.

Solomon’s workers built the temple
1 Then Solomon’s workers started to build the temple for Yahweh in Jerusalem.
David. They built it on the ground that Araunah, a descendant of the Jebus peoplegroup, had sold to David and where David said that it should be built.
3 The foundation of the temple was about 90 feet long and 30 feet wide.
high.
5 Solomon’s workers used panels/boards of pine wood to line the main hall of the
temple. Then they covered those panels with very thin sheets of pure gold. Then they
decorated the walls with carved images of palm trees and designs that resembled
chains.
6 They decorated the temple with very valuable stones. The gold that they used was
from the land of Parvaim.
7 They covered the ceiling beams, the door frames, the walls and the doors of the
temple with very thin sheets of gold. They also carved statues of winged creatures on
the walls.
8 They also built the Very Holy Place inside the temple. It was 30 feet wide and 30
feet long. They covered its walls with sheets of pure gold that altogether weighed 23
tons.
9 They used 1-1/4 pounds of gold to cover the heads of the nails. They also covered
the walls of the upper rooms with sheets of gold.
10 Solomon’s workers made two statues of creatures with wings to put inside the
Very Holy Place. They covered those statues with very thin sheets of gold.
11-12 Each statue had two long wings. One wing of each statue touched one of the
walls of the Temple. The other wing of each statue touched a wing of the other statue.
It was 7-1/2 feet from the outer tip of one wing to the outer tip of the other wing. The
inner wings of the two statues touched each other.
2 CHRONICLES 3:13
625
2 CHRONICLES 4:15
13 It was 30 feet from the outer wing of the one statue to the outer wing of the other
statue. The statues faced the doorway to the main room.
14 Solomon’s workers made a curtain to separate the main room from the Very Holy
Place. It was made of blue, purple, and red thread and fine linen. There were figures
of winged creatures that were embroidered on the curtain.
15 They made two bronze pillars and put them at the entrance of the temple. They
were each 27 feet high. Each had a top over it that was 7-1/2 feet high.
16 The workers made carvings that resembled chains and put them on top of the
pillars. They made carvings that resembled pomegranates and attached them to the
chains.
17 They set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the south side of the entrance
and the other on the north side. The one on the south side was named Jakin and the
one on the north side was named Boaz.

The furnishings for the temple

side, and it was 5 yards high.
mold. It was 10 yards wide/across, and 5 yards high. It was 15 yards around it.
3 Below the outer rim there were two rows of small figures of bulls that were part
of the metal of the basin. Each row had 300 figures of bulls.
4 The basin was set on twelve statues of bulls. There were three statues that faced
north, three that faced west, three that faced south, and three that faced east.
5 The sides of the tank were 3 inches thick, and its rim was shaped like a cup that
curved outward like the petals of flowers. The basin held about 16,500 gallons of
water.
6 They also made ten basins for washing the animals that were to be sacrificed. The
priests used the very large tank for washing themselves.
7 They also made ten gold lampstands according to what Solomon had instructed
them. They put them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north side.
8 They made ten tables and put them in the temple, five on the south side and five
on the north side. They also made 100 gold bowls.
9 They also constructed one courtyard for the priests, and a larger courtyard for the
of bronze.

So Huram and his workers finished the work that King Solomon had given him to
12 These were the things that they made:
the two large pillars,
the two bowl-shaped top parts on top of the pillars,
the two sets of carvings that resembled chains to decorate the tops of the two pillars,
13 the 400 carvings that resembled pomegranates that were placed in two rows, that
decorated the bowl-shaped tops of the two pillars,
14 the stands, and the basins that were placed on them,
15 the very large tank, and the statues of twelve bulls underneath it,

2 CHRONICLES 5:11
16 the pots, shovels, meat forks, and all the other things needed for the work at the
altar.
All those things that Huram and his workers made for King Solomon were made of
polished bronze.
17 They made them by pouring melted bronze into the clay molds that Huram had
set up near the Jordan river between Succoth and Zarethan cities.
18 All of those things that Solomon told them to make used a very large amount of
bronze; no one tried to weigh it all.
19 Solomon’s workers also made all these things that were put at the temple:
the golden altar,
the tables on which the priests put the sacred bread,
20 the pure gold lampstands and the pure gold lamps, in which the priests put oil to
burn in front of the Most Holy Place as God had told Moses that the priests should
do,
21 the pure gold decorations that resembled flowers, and the lamps and tongs,
22 the pure gold wick trimmers and bowls for sprinkling, and dishes and lamp
snuffers,
the gold doors of the temple
and the doors to the main hall.

1 After Solomon’s workers had finished building the temple, Solomon put in the
the silver and gold and all the other things that were used at the temple.
2 Then King Solomon summoned to Jerusalem all the elders of Israel, all the leaders
of the tribes and of the families/clans. He wanted them to help to bring to the temple
Yahweh’s Sacred Chest from Zion Hill, where it was in the part of the city called ‘The
City of David’.
3 So all the leaders of Israel gathered together along with the king, during the
Festival of Living in Temporary Shelters, in October.
4 When they had all arrived, the descendants of Levi lifted up the Sacred Chest,
5 and they carried it and the Sacred Tent and the sacred things that were inside it.
The priests, who were also descended from Levi, carried them.
6 King Solomon and many of the other people of Israel who had gathered there
walked in front of the Sacred Chest. And they sacrificed a huge amount of sheep and
cattle. No one was able to count them because there were very many.
7 The priests then brought the Sacred Chest into the Most Holy Place, the inner room
of the temple, and they placed it under the wings of the statues of winged creatures.
8 The wings of those statues spread out over the Sacred Chest and over the poles
by which it was carried.
9 The poles were very long, with the result that they could be seen by those who
were standing at the entrance to the Most Holy Place, but they could not be seen by
anyone standing outside the temple. Those poles are still there.
10 The only things that were inside the Sacred Chest were the two stone tablets that
Moses had put there at Sinai Mountain, where Yahweh made an agreement with the
Israeli people after they came out of Egypt.
11 Then the priests left the Holy Place. All the priests who were there, from every
group, had performed the rituals to cause them to be acceptable to God.
2 CHRONICLES 5:12
627
2 CHRONICLES 6:14
12 All the descendants of Levi who were musicians—Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, their
sons and their other relatives—stood on the east side of the altar. They were wearing
linen clothes, and they were playing cymbals, harps, and lyres. There were 120 other
priests who were blowing trumpets.
13 The men blowing trumpets, those playing the cymbals and other musical
instruments, and the singers, made music together, praising Yahweh and singing this
song:
“Yahweh is good to us;
he faithfully loves us forever.”
Then suddenly the temple was filled with a cloud.
14 The glorious radiance of Yahweh filled the temple, with the result that the priests
were not able to continue doing their work.
6
1 Then Solomon said, “Yahweh, you said that you would live in a dark cloud.
3 Then while all the people stood there, Solomon turned toward the people and he
asked God to bless them.
4 He said to them,
“Praise Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelis belong, who has caused to happen
what he promised to my father David. What he said to David was this:
5 ‘From the time that I brought my people out of Egypt, I have never chosen a
city in Israel in which a temple should be built for people to worship me there. Nor
6 But now I have chosen Jerusalem to be the place for people to worship me, and
7 Then Solomon said, “My father David wanted to build a temple for Yahweh, the
8 But Yahweh said to him, ‘You have wanted to build a temple for me, and what
you wanted to do was good.
9 However, you are not the one who I want to build the temple; it is one of your
own sons who I want to build a temple for me.’
10 “And Yahweh has done what he promised to do. I have become the king of
Israel to succeed my father, and I am ruling the people, like Yahweh promised, and
I have arranged for this temple to be built for us to worship Yahweh, the God to
whom we Israelis belong.
11 I have put the Sacred Chest in the temple, in which are the stone tablets on
which are engraved the Ten Commandments of the agreement that Yahweh made with
us Israeli people.”
Solomon’s prayer to dedicate the temple
12 Then Solomon stood in front of the altar which was in front of the people of
Israel who had gathered there.
13 His workers had built a bronze platform there for him to stand on, which was 71/2 feet long and 7-1/2 feet wide and 4-1/2 feet high. They put it in the outer courtyard.
Solomon stood on that platform and then knelt down in front of all the people of Israel
who had gathered there, and he spread out his arms toward heaven,
14 and he prayed,
“Yahweh, the God to whom we Israeli people belong, there is no God like you in
heaven or on the earth. You solemnly promised that you would faithfully love us,
and that is what you have done for us who earnestly do what you want us to do.
2 CHRONICLES 6:15
628
2 CHRONICLES 6:32
very well, that you would do. Truly, you promised to do those things for him, and
today we see that by your power you have caused it all to happen.
16 “So now, Yahweh, the God we Israelis belong to, please do the things that you
promised to my father David that you would do. You said that there would always
be some of his descendants to rule Israel, if they faithfully conduct their lives as he
did.
17 So now, God of us Israeli people, cause what you promised David, who served
you well, to happen.
18 “But, my God, will you really live on earth among people? There is surely not
enough space for you in the sky, or even in the heaven! So there is surely not
enough space for you to live in this temple that my workers have built.
19 But Yahweh, my God, please listen to my prayer, while I am pleading with you
this day and do what I am requesting.
20 Please protect this temple day and night. This is the place about which you
have said, ‘I will always be there.’ Please listen to my prayer about this place.
21 Listen to me when I pray, and listen to your Israeli people when they pray.
Listen from heaven, where you live; and when you hear us pray, forgive us.
22 “If someone is accused of doing something wrong to another person, and they
bring him to testify in front of your altar outside this holy temple, and if he says,
23 then you listen from heaven, and you decide who is telling the truth. Then
other person is innocent.
24 “And when your Israeli people are defeated by their enemies because they
sinned against you, and forced to go to some distant country, if they turn away from
their sinful behavior and turn toward this temple and admit that you have justly
punished them, and plead that you will forgive them,
25 listen to them from heaven and forgive your Israeli people for the sins that they
have committed, and bring them back to this land that you gave to our ancestors.
26 “When you do not allow any rain to fall because your people have sinned
against you, if they turn toward this temple and admit that you have justly punished
them, and turn away from their sinful behavior and humbly pray to you,
27 hear from heaven and forgive the sins of your Israeli people. Teach them the
right way to conduct their lives. Then cause it to rain here on the land that you gave
to your people to belong to them permanently.
28 “And when the people of this land experience famines or if there is a plague,
or when their crops are destroyed by very hot winds or by mildew or by locusts or
grasshoppers, or when their enemies surround any of their cities in order to attack
them, if any of those bad things happen to them,
29 when your Israeli people earnestly plead with you, knowing in their inner
beings that they are suffering because they have sinned, if they stretch out their hands
toward this temple and pray,
30 hear from your home in heaven, and forgive them. You alone know what each
person is thinking, so reward each person according to everything that he does,
31 in order that they will revere you and conduct their lives as you want them to,
all the time that they live in this land that you gave to our ancestors.
32 “There will be some foreigners who do not belong to your Israeli people who
have come here from countries far away because they have heard that you are
very great and that you perform great miracles. If they turn toward this temple
2 CHRONICLES 6:33
629
2 CHRONICLES 7:6
and pray,
33 from your home in heaven listen to their prayer, and do for them what they
request you to do. Do that in order that all the people-groups in the world will know
about you and revere you, like we, your own Israeli people do. And then they will
know that this is the temple that I have caused to be built for you.
34 “When you send your people to go to places to attack their enemies, if they
pray to you, wherever they are, if they turn toward this city that you have chosen
and toward this temple that I have caused to be built to honor you,
35 listen in heaven to their prayers; listen to what they plead for you to do, and
assist them.
36 “It is true that everyone sins. So, when your people sin against you, and you
become angry with them, you may allow their enemies to capture them and take
them to their countries, even to countries that are far away.
37 When that happens, while they are in the countries to which they were forced
to go, if they are sorry for having sinned, if they say, ‘We have sinned; we have done

39 then from your home in heaven hear their prayer, and listen to them while
they plead for your help, and do what they ask you to do, and forgive your people
who have sinned against you.
40 “Now, my God, look at us and listen to us as we pray to you in this place.
41 Yahweh our God, come and stay in this place with the Sacred Chest,
the chest that shows that you are powerful.
Yahweh God, cause your priests to know clearly that you have blessed them.
Cause us your people to rejoice because of all the good things that you do for us.
42 Yahweh God, do not reject me the king whom you have appointed to be the king of
Israel;
do not forget that you greatly loved David, who served you very well.”

Solomon dedicated the temple
1 When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from the sky and burned all the
offerings and sacrifices that were on the altar, and the glorious radiance of Yahweh
filled the temple.
2 The radiance was extremely bright, with the result that the priests could not enter
the temple of Yahweh.
3 When all the Israeli people who were there saw the fire coming down and the glory
of Yahweh above the temple, they prostrated themselves with their faces touching the
ground. They worshiped and thanked Yahweh, singing,
“Yahweh is always good to us;
he faithfully loves us forever.”
4-5 Then the king and all the people who were there dedicated the temple to Yahweh
by offering more sacrifices to him. King Solomon gave 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep
and goats to be sacrificed.
6 The priests stood in their positions, and the other descendants of Levi stood in their
positions holding the musical instruments to praise Yahweh, instruments that King
David had caused to be made for praising Yahweh and thanking him. They sang, “He
2 CHRONICLES 7:7
630
2 CHRONICLES 7:22
faithfully loves us forever.” Facing the other descendants of Levi the priests stood,
blowing their trumpets, while all the Israeli people were standing and listening.
7 Solomon dedicated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple. Then
he gave offerings to be completely burned there along with the fat of the animals
to be sacrificed to maintain fellowship with Yahweh. The priests burned them there
in the courtyard because in addition to those things there were offerings of grain,
with the result that there was not enough space on the bronze altar to burn all those
sacrifices.
8 Solomon and the other people celebrated the Festival of Living in Temporary
Shelters for seven days. There was a huge group of people who celebrated with
him. Some of them came from as far away as Lebo-Hamath in the far north and the
border of Egypt in the far south.
They had
Temporary Shelters for seven days.
10 Then on the next day Solomon sent them to their homes. They were very joyful
because of all the good things that Yahweh had done for David and Solomon and for
all his Israeli people.
Yahweh appeared to Solomon again
11 Solomon’s workers finished building the temple and Solomon’s palace.
And
Solomon finished doing everything else that he had planned to do.
12 Then Yahweh appeared to him one night in a dream and said to him,
“I have heard your prayer, and I have chosen this temple to be the place where
my people will offer sacrifices to me.
13 “When I prevent any rain from falling, or when I command locusts to eat all
the crops, or when I send a plague among my people,
14 if the people who belong to me humble themselves and pray, and request me
to help them, and if they turn away from their sinful behavior, then I will hear from
heaven. I will forgive them for having sinned and I will cause them to prosper again.
15 I [SYN] will see them and I [SYN] will hear them when they pray to me in this
place.
16 I have chosen and have ◄set apart/dedicated► this temple in order that people
may worship [MTY] me there forever. I will always watch over [MTY] it and protect
[IDM] it.
17 “And as for you, if you obey me as David your father did, and if you do all that
I command you to do, and obey all my laws and decrees,
18 I will make sure that your descendants will always be kings, which is what I
promised to David your father, saying, ‘Some of your descendants will always be the
kings of Israel.’
19 “But if you Israelis turn away from me and disobey the decrees and commands
that I have given to you, and you start to worship other gods,
20 I will cause you to be expelled from this land that I have given to you, and I
will abandon this temple that I have set apart to be the place where people should
worship me. I will cause it to be despised and ridiculed by people of all nations.
21 Although this temple is now greatly respected, when that happens, all the
people who pass by will be appalled, and they will say, ‘Why has Yahweh done terrible
things like this to this country and to this temple?’
22 And others will reply, ‘It happened because they rejected Yahweh, the God to
whom their ancestors belonged, the one who brought their ancestors out of Egypt,
2 CHRONICLES 8:1
631
2 CHRONICLES 8:18
and they have been worshiping other gods and trying to please them. And that is
why Yahweh has caused them to experience all these disasters.’ ”
Other things that Solomon did
2 Then his workers rebuilt the cities that King Hiram had given back to Solomon,
and Solomon sent Israelis to live in those cities.
3 Solomon’s army then went to Hamath-Zobah town and captured it.
4 His workers also rebuilt walls around Tadmor town in the desert, and in the
Hamath region in all the towns where they kept supplies.
5 They rebuilt Upper Beth-Horon town and Lower Beth-Horon city, and built walls
around them with gates in the walls and bars to fasten the gates.
6 They also rebuilt Baalath town and all the cities where supplies were kept and
the cities where Solomon’s chariots and horses were kept. Solomon’s workers built
whatever he wanted them to build, in Jerusalem and in Lebanon, and in other places
in the area that he ruled.
7 Solomon forced people from many other groups who were not Israelis to work
for him like slaves. They were people from the Heth, Amor, Periz, Hiv, and Jebus
people-groups.
8 They were descendants of groups whom the Israelis had not completely destroyed.
Solomon forced them to become his slaves, and they are still slaves.
9 But Solomon did not force Israelis to work for him. Israelis became his soldiers
and commanders of his chariots and his chariot-drivers.
10 They were also King Solomon’s chief officials. There were 250 of them, and they
supervised the workers.
11 Solomon moved his wife, who was the daughter of the king of Egypt, from the
place outside Jerusalem called ‘The City of David’ to the place that his workers had
built for her. He said, “I do not want my wife to live in the palace that my father King
David’s workers built, because the Sacred Chest was in that palace for a while, and
any place where the Sacred Chest has been is holy.”
12 On the altar that Solomon’s workers had built in front of the entrance to the
temple, Solomon sacrificed many offerings that were to be completely burned.
13 He did that to obey the rules about what sacrifices Moses had declared should
be made. These included sacrifices for every day and for the Sabbath days and to
celebrate each day on which there was a new moon and for the three other festivals
that were celebrated each year. Those festivals were the Festival of Eating Unleavened
Bread, the Harvest Festival, and the Festival of Living in Temporary Shelters.
14 Obeying what his father David had commanded, he appointed the groups of
priests for their work, and he appointed the descendants of Levi to lead the people
while they sang to praise Yahweh and while they assisted the priests in their daily
work. He also appointed groups of them to guard all the gates, because that was also
what David, the man who pleased God very well, had commanded.
15 The priests and other descendants of Levi obeyed completely everything that the
king commanded, including taking care of the storerooms.
16 They did all the work of building the temple that Solomon told them to do, until
it was all completed. So they finishing building the temple.
17 Then some of Solomon’s men went to Ezion-Geber and Elath cities on the coast
of the Red Sea, an area that belonged to the Edom people-group.
18 King Hiram sent to Solomon from Tyre city some ships that were commanded
by his officers. They were men who were experienced sailors. These men went in

The queen of Sheba visited Solomon
1 The queen who ruled the Sheba area in Arabia heard that Solomon had become
famous, so she traveled to Jerusalem to ask him questions that were difficult to
answer. She came with a large group of servants, and she brought camels that were
loaded with spices, and valuable gems, and a lot of gold. When she met Solomon, she
asked him questions about all the things/topics in which she was interested.
2 Solomon answered all her questions. He explained everything that she asked
about, even things that were very difficult.
3 The queen realized that Solomon was very wise. She saw his palace,
4 she saw the food that was served on his table every day; she saw how his officials
were seated at the table, their uniforms, the servants who served the food and wine,
and the sacrifices that he took to the temple to be completely burned on the altar.
She was extremely amazed.
5 She said to the king, “Everything that I heard in my own country about you and
about how wise you are is true!
6 But I did not believe it was true until I came here and saw it myself. You are
extremely wise and rich, more than what people told me.
7 The men who work for you are very fortunate! Your officials who are constantly
standing in front of you and listening to the wise things that you say are also
fortunate!
8 Praise Yahweh your God, who has shown that he is pleased with you by appointing
you to be the king of Israel for him. God has always loved the Israeli people, and
desires to assist them forever, and therefore he has appointed you to be their king,
in order that you will rule them fairly and righteously.”
9 Then the queen gave to Solomon about 4-1/2 tons of gold and a large amount of
spices and gems. Never had King Solomon received more spices than the queen gave
him at that time.
10-12 King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba everything that she wanted. He gave
her more than she had given to him. Then she and those who came with her returned
to her own land.
In the ships that belonged to King Hiram, Hiram’s workers and Solomon’s workers
brought gold from Ophir. They also brought a large amount of juniper wood and
gems. King Solomon told his workers to use that wood to make railings in the temple
and in his palace and also to make harps and lyres for the musicians. That wood was
the the finest wood that had ever been seen in Israel.
Solomon’s wealth
13 Each year there was brought to Solomon a total of 25 tons of gold.
14 That was in addition to the taxes paid to him by the merchants and traders. Also,
the kings of Arabia and the governors of the districts in Israel brought gold and silver
to Solomon.
15 King Solomon’s workers took this gold and hammered it into thin sheets and
covered 200 large shields with those thin sheets of gold; they put almost 7-1/2 pounds
of gold on each shield.
pounds of gold. Then the king put those shields in the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon.
2 CHRONICLES 9:17
633
2 CHRONICLES 10:4
17 His workers also made for him a large throne.
Part of it was covered with
decorations made from ivory and part of it was covered with very fine gold.
attached to the throne. At each side of the throne there was an armrest, and alongside
each armrest there was a small statue of a lion.
19 On the six steps there were twelve statues of lions, one on each side. No throne
like that had ever existed in any other kingdom.
20 All of Solomon’s cups were made of gold, and all the various dishes in the Hall
of the Forest of Lebanon were made of gold. They did not make things from silver,
because during the years that Solomon ruled, silver was not considered to be valuable.
21 The king had a fleet of ships that sailed with the ships that King Hiram owned.
Every three years the ships returned from the places to which they had sailed, bringing
gold, silver, ivory, monkeys, and baboons (OR, peacocks).
22 King Solomon became richer and wiser than any other king on the earth.
23 Kings from all over the world wanted to come and listen to the wise things that
Solomon said, things that God had enabled him to know.
24 All the people who came to him brought presents: They brought things made
from silver or gold, or robes, or weapons, or spices, or horses, or mules. The people
continued to do this every year.
25 Solomon had 4,000 stalls for his horses and chariots, and 12,000 horses. Solomon
put some of them in Jerusalem and some of them in other cities where he kept his
chariots.
26 Solomon ruled over all the kings in the area from the Euphrates River in the
northeast to the Philistia area in the west to the border of Egypt in the south.
27 During the years that Solomon was king, he caused silver to become as common
in Jerusalem as stones; and he caused cedar trees in the foothills of Judah to become
as plentiful as fig trees.
28 Solomon’s agents brought horses from the Musri area and other places.
Solomon’s death
29 Lists of all the other things that Solomon did are recorded in the scrolls written
by the prophet Nathan and by the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh city, and in the scroll in
which were written the visions that the prophet Iddo saw concerning King Jeroboam.
30 Solomon ruled from Jerusalem all of Israel for 40 years.
31 Then Solomon died and was buried in the part of Jerusalem called ‘The City of
David’. And his son Rehoboam became the king.
10
The people of Israel rebelled against Rehoboam
1 All the people of Israel went to Shechem city in order to appoint Rehoboam to be
their king. So Rehoboam also went there.
2 Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, had fled to Egypt to escape from King Solomon. But
returned to Israel from Egypt
talk to Rehoboam. They said to Rehoboam,
4 “Your father Solomon forced us to work very hard for him. If you do not force us
to work that hard, and if you charge us less taxes than we were paying to him, we
will serve you faithfully.”
2 CHRONICLES 10:5
634
2 CHRONICLES 11:2
5 He replied, “Come back three days from now and I will give you my answer.” So
those leaders and Jeroboam left.
6 Then King Rehoboam consulted his older men who had advised his father Solomon
while he was still alive. He asked them, “What shall I say to answer these men?”
7 They replied, “If you will be kind to these people and do things that will please
them, and if you say kind things to them when you answer them, they will always
serve you.”
8 But he ignored what the older men advised him to do. Instead, he consulted the
younger men who had grown up with him, who were now his advisors.
9 He said to them, “How should I answer the men who are asking me to reduce the
work and taxes that my father required from them?”
10 The young men who had grown up with him replied, “Those men have said that
your father forced them to work very hard for him, so they want you to reduce the
work and taxes that your father required from them. But this is what you should tell
them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist.
11 What I mean is that my father required you to work hard and pay high taxes. But
I will make those loads heavier. It was as though my father whipped you, but I will
whip you with whips that have pieces of metal in them.’ ”
12 Three days later, Jeroboam and all the leaders came to King Rehoboam again,
which is what he had told them to do.
13 The king ignored the advice of the older men and spoke harshly to the Israeli
leaders.
14 He told them what the younger men had advised. He said, “My father put heavy
burdens of work and taxes on you, but I will put heavier burdens on you. It was as
though he beat you with whips, but I will beat you with whips that have pieces of
metal in them!”
15 So the king did not pay any attention to the Israeli leaders. But this happened in
order that what Yahweh had told the prophet Ahijah about Jeroboam would happen.
16 When the Israeli leaders realized that the king did not pay any attention to what
they said, they shouted,
“We do not want anything to do with this descendant of King David!
We will not pay attention to what this grandson of Jesse says!
You people of Israel, let’s go home!
As for this descendant of David, he can rule his own kingdom!”
So the Israeli leaders returned to their homes.
17 And after that, the only Israeli people whom Rehoboam ruled over were those
who lived in the territory of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.
18 Then King Rehoboam went with Adoniram to talk to the Israeli people. Adoniram
was the man who supervised all the men who were forced to work for Rehoboam. But
the Israeli people killed him by throwing stones at him. When that happened, King
19 Ever since that time, the people of the northern tribes of Israel have been rebelling
11
1 When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he gathered 180,000 of the best soldiers
from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. He wanted them to fight against the northern
again.
2 CHRONICLES 11:3
635
2 CHRONICLES 11:23
3 “Go and tell this to Solomon’s son Rehoboam, the king of Judah, and to all the
Israeli people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin:
4 ‘Yahweh says that you must not go to fight against the people of Israel; they are
your distant relatives. All of you must go home. What has happened is what Yahweh
wanted to happen.’ ” So Shemaiah went and told that to them, and they all heeded
what Yahweh had commanded them to do, and they did not attack Jeroboam and his
soldiers.
Rehoboam fortified cities in Judah
5 Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and his workers built walls around several of the
cities and towns in Judah to protect them against enemy attacks.
6 In the area that belonged to the tribes of Judah and Benjamin they built walls
around Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,
7 Beth-Zur, Soco, Adullam,
8 Gath, Mareshah,
9 Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,
10 Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron.
11 He also appointed an army commander in each of those cities and towns, and
gave them supplies of food, olive oil, and wine to keep in storage.
12 He put shields and spears in all the cities and made them well-protected. So he
continued to rule the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.
13 The priests and other descendants of Levi throughout Israel supported Rehoboam.
14 The descendants of Levi who lived outside the territory of Judah and Benjamin
abandoned their property and their pastureland, and they came to Jerusalem and to
other places in Judah, because Jeroboam and his sons would not allow them to do the
work of priests of Yahweh.
15 Instead, Jeroboam appointed the priests that he wanted to work at the altars
he commanded to be built on the hilltops, to offer sacrifices to the idols that he
commanded to be made that resembled goats and calves.
16 And people from every tribe in Israel who wanted to worship Yahweh, the God
to whom the Israelis belonged, went with the descendants of Levi to Jerusalem to live
there and to offer sacrifices to Yahweh, the God whom their ancestors worshiped.
17 They caused the kingdom of Judah to be strong, and for three years they were
happy that Solomon’s son Rehoboam was the king. During that time they conducted
their lives righteously as David and Solomon had done previously.
Rehoboam’s family
18 Rehoboam married Mahalath. She was the daughter of David’s son Jerimoth, and
her mother was Abihail, the daughter of Eliab and granddaughter of Jesse.
19 Rehoboam and Mahalath had three sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.
20 Later Rehoboam married Maacah, the daughter of Absalom, and they had four
sons: Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
21 Rehoboam loved Maacah more than he loved any other of his wives and slave
wives. Altogether he had 18 wives and 60 slave wives, and 28 sons and 60 daughters.
22 Rehoboam appointed his son Abijah to be the leader of his older and younger
brothers, because he wanted to appoint Abijah to be the next king.
23 He very wisely sent some of his other sons to other cities in the areas of the tribes
of Judah and Benjamin, and to all the other cities that had walls around them. He
gave them plenty of supplies and many wives.

The army of King Shishak of Egypt invaded Judah
1 After Rehoboam was in complete control of his kingdom, he and all the other
people in Judah stopped obeying the laws of Yahweh.
Shishak, the king of Egypt, with his army to attack Jerusalem.
and a very large number of troops from two regions in Libya, and from Ethiopia.
4 They captured many of the cities in Judah that had walls around them, and they
came as far as Jerusalem.
5 Then the prophet Shemaiah came to Rehoboam and the other leaders of Judah
who had gathered in Jerusalem because they were afraid of the army of Shishak.
Shemaiah said to them, “Yahweh says this: ‘You have abandoned me; so now I am
abandoning you, to allow you to be captured by the army of Shishak.’ ”
6 Then the king and the other Israeli leaders humbled themselves and said, “What
Yahweh is doing to us is fair.”
7 When Yahweh realized that they had humbled themselves, he gave this message
to Shemaiah: “Because they have humbled themselves, I will not allow them to
be destroyed. Instead, I will soon rescue them. I will not use Shishak’s army to
completely destroy the people of Jerusalem,
8 but they will conquer Jerusalem and force the people there to do what Shishak
wants them to do. As a result, the people of Jerusalem will learn that it is better to
serve me than to serve the kings of other countries.”
9 When Shishak’s army attacked Jerusalem, they took/carried away the valuable
things that were in the temple of Yahweh and the valuable things that were in the
king’s palace. They took everything that was valuable, including the gold shields that
Solomon’s workers had made.
10 So King Rehoboam’s workers made bronze shields to be used instead of the gold
ones and gave the bronze shields to the commanders of the men who guarded the
entrance to his palace.
11 After that, whenever the king went to the temple, the guards went with him,
carrying those bronze shields. Then when the king left, they would return the shields
to the guards’ room.
12 Because Rehoboam humbled himself, Yahweh stopped being angry with him and
did not get rid of him. Instead, he caused good things to happen in Judah.
13 King Rehoboam again was in complete control in Jerusalem and continued to be
the king of Judah. He was 41 years old when he became the king. He ruled for 17
years in Jerusalem, which is the city that Yahweh had chosen from all the tribes in
Israel to be the place in which people were to worship him.
14 Rehoboam’s mother’s name was Naamah. She was from the Ammon peoplegroup. Rehoboam did evil things because he did not try to find out what Yahweh
wanted him to do.
15 An account of all the things that Rehoboam did while he was the king, and lists
of the members of his family, are in the scrolls written by the prophets Shemaiah and
Iddo. The armies of Rehoboam and Jeroboam were constantly fighting each other.
16 When Rehoboam died, he was buried in the part of Jerusalem called ‘The City of
David’. Then his son Abijah became the king.
King Abijah’s rule in Judah

1 When Jeroboam had been ruling Israel for almost 18 years, Abijah became the
king of Judah.
daughter of Uriel from Gibeah town.
3 Abijah went into the battle, taking 400,000 of his capable soldiers, and Jeroboam
prepared to fight them, taking 800,000 of his capable troops.
4 Abijah stood on the top of Zemaraim Mountain, which is in the hilly area that
belonged to the tribe of Ephraim, and he shouted, “Jeroboam and all you other people
of Israel, listen to me!
5 You should know that Yahweh, the God to whom all we Israelis belong, has
appointed David and his descendants to be the kings of Israel forever. He has
confirmed that by making a permanent agreement.
6 But Jeroboam, who was only an official of David’s son King Solomon, rebelled
against his king.
7 And when Solomon’s son Rehoboam became king and was still young and
inexperienced, a group of worthless scoundrels gathered around you, Jeroboam, and
rebelled against Rehoboam.
8 “And now you are planning to fight against the kingdom that Yahweh established
to be governed by David’s descendants. It is true that you have a huge army, and you
and your soldiers have brought with you the golden statues of calves that Jeroboam’s
workers made to be gods for all of you.
9 But you expelled the priests that Yahweh appointed, men who are descendants
of Aaron the first Supreme Priest, and you expelled the descendants of Levi, and you
appointed the priests that you wanted, like the people of other countries do. You
allow anyone to become a priest of idols that are not gods if he comes to dedicate
himself to be a priest by sacrificing a young bull and seven rams.
10 “As for us, Yahweh is our God, and we have not abandoned him. Our priests who
serve Yahweh are descendants of Aaron, and the descendants of Levi assist them.
11 Every morning and every evening they present to Yahweh offerings to be
completely burned on the altar, and they burn fragrant incense. Each week they
place the sacred bread on the sacred table, and each morning they light the lamps
that are on the gold lampstand. We are obeying what Yahweh our God requires us
to do. But you have abandoned him.
12 Yahweh is with us; he is our leader. The priests whom he has appointed will blow
their trumpets to signal that we are ready to fight a battle against you. You Israeli
men, do not fight against Yahweh, the God to whom your ancestors belonged, because
you will not be successful and win the battle against him.”
13 While he was speaking, Jeroboam sent some of his troops around the army of
Judah. So while the soldiers who were with Jeroboam were in front of the army of
Judah, the other soldiers of Israel were behind the army of Judah.
14 When the soldiers of Judah turned and saw that they were going to be attacked
from the front and from the rear, they cried out to Yahweh. The priests blew their
trumpets,
15 and the men of Judah shouted a loud battle-cry. Then Yahweh enabled Abijah and
the army of Judah to defeat Jeroboam and the army of Israel.
16 The soldiers of Israel fled from the soldiers of Judah, and God enabled the army
of Judah to defeat them.
17 Abijah and his troops struck the capable soldiers of Israel and killed 500,000 of
them.

of Israel the cities of Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, and the surrounding villages.
20 During the remaining time that Abijah ruled, Jeroboam did not become powerful
again. Then Yahweh caused him to become very ill, and he died.
21 But Abijah became more powerful. He married 14 wives and had 22 sons and 16
daughters.
22 An account of the other things that Abijah did while he was the king, including
what he said and what he did, is in the scroll written by the prophet Iddo.
14
1 When Abijah died, he was buried in the part of Jerusalem called ‘The City of David’.
His son Asa became the king. While Asa was ruling, there was peace in Judah for ten
years.
King Asa’s rule in Judah
2 Asa did things that Yahweh his God considers to be right and good.
3 His workers got rid of the altars to worship foreign gods that were on the high
hills. They smashed the sacred stone pillars and cut down the poles for worshiping
the goddess Asherah.
4 Asa commanded the people of Judah to worship only Yahweh, the God whom their
ancestors worshiped, and to obey his laws and commands.
5 His workers destroyed all the shrines on the hilltops and the altars for burning
incense to idols in every town in Judah. As a result, there was peace while Asa ruled
the kingdom of Judah.
6 His workers built cities and constructed walls around them. No army attacked
Judah during that time, because Yahweh enabled them to have peace.
7 Asa said to the people of Judah, “We should protect these towns by building walls
around them, with watchtowers and gates that have bars. This country still belongs
to us because we have requested Yahweh our God to help us. We requested him for
his help, and he has given us peace in our entire country.” So they built buildings
and prospered.
8 Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah. They all carried large shields and
spears. He also had 280,000 men from the tribe of Benjamin in his army. They carried
smaller shields, and bows and arrows. They were all brave soldiers.
9 Zerah, a man from Ethiopia/Sudan, marched with a huge army and 300 chariots
to attack the army of Judah and Benjamin. They went as far as the town of Mareshah
about 25 miles/southwest of Jerusalem.
10 Asa went with his army to fight against them, and both armies took their positions
in the Zephathah Valley.
11 Then Asa cried out to Yahweh his God, saying, “Yahweh, there is no one like you
who can help those who have very little power to resist a mighty army. Yahweh our
God, help us, because we are relying on you; and trusting in you we have come to
fight against this huge army. Yahweh, you are our God; do not allow anyone to defeat
you.”
12 Then Yahweh enabled Asa and the army of Judah to defeat the army from
Ethiopia. They fled,
13 and Asa and his army pursued them to the southwest as far as Gerar. A huge
number of the soldiers from Ethiopia were killed, with the result that those who were
2 CHRONICLES 14:14
639
2 CHRONICLES 15:15
not killed were unable to fight any more. They were greatly defeated by Yahweh and
his army, and the men of Judah carried away a great amount of their possessions.
14 The men of Judah were able to destroy the people in villages near Gerar because
Yahweh had caused the people there to become terrified and unable to fight. The
army of Judah took away all the valuable things from those villages.
15 They also attacked the places where the local people who took care of domestic
animals had set up their tents, and they took away big herds of sheep and goats and
camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
15
The reforms that Asa introduced
1 The Spirit of God came upon Azariah, the son of Obed.
2 Azariah went to talk with Asa, and said to him, “Asa and all you men of the tribes
of Judah and Benjamin, listen to me. Yahweh is with you whenever you are trusting
in him. If you request him to help you, he will help you, but if you abandon him, he
will abandon you.
3 For many years the Israeli people did not know the true God, and they did not
have priests or God’s laws.
4 But when they experienced trouble, they turned to Yahweh our God, and requested
him to help them. And he helped them.
5 At that time, people were not safe when they traveled, because all the people who
lived in the nearby countries were experiencing many difficulties.
6 The people of various nations were thoroughly defeated by armies of other nations,
and people in some cities were crushed by armies from other cities, because God was
allowing them to experience many difficulties.
7 But you people, you must be strong and do not become discouraged, because God
will reward you for what you do to please him.”
8 When Asa heard what the prophet Azariah said, he was encouraged.
He
commanded his workers to remove all the detestable idols from everywhere in the
land of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and from the towns that his soldiers had
captured in the hills of the tribe of Ephraim. Asa’s workers repaired the altar where
people offered sacrifices to Yahweh that was in front of the entrance to the temple in
Jerusalem.
9 Then he gathered all the people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin and many
people from the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who were living among
come to me to Judah when they realized that Yahweh, the God that Asa worshiped,
was helping him.
10 After Asa had been ruling for almost 15 years, in May of that year, those people
gathered in Jerusalem.
11 At that time they sacrificed to Yahweh 700 bulls and 7,000 sheep and goats, from
the animals that they had captured when they defeated the army of Ethiopia/Sudan.
12 They solemnly made an agreement to very sincerely worship Yahweh, the God
13 They promised to execute all those who would not worship Yahweh, including
14 They shouted and blew trumpets and other horns while they solemnly promised
15 All the people who were living in Judah were happy with the agreement because
they had solemnly and very sincerely promised to keep it. They eagerly requested
2 CHRONICLES 15:16
640
2 CHRONICLES 16:10
help from Yahweh, and he helped them. So he enabled them to have peace throughout
their country.
16 King Asa’s grandmother Maacah had made a disgusting pole for worshiping the
goddess Asherah. So Asa commanded his workers to cut down that pole and chop it
into pieces and burn it in the Kidron Valley. He then did not allow Maacah to continue
to influence the people because of her being the mother of the previous king.
17 Although Asa’s workers did not get rid of the shrines on the hilltops in Israel, he
was very determined to do what pleased Yahweh all his life.
18 He ordered his workers to bring into God’s temple all the silver and gold and
other valuable items that he and his father had dedicated to God.
19 There were no more wars in Judah until Asa had been ruling Judah almost 35
years.
16
The final years that Asa ruled Judah
1 When Asa had been ruling Judah for almost 36 years, King Baasha of Israel went
with his army to attack Judah. They captured the town of Ramah north of Jerusalem
and started to build a wall around it, in order to prevent any people from entering
or leaving the area in Judah that was ruled by King Asa because the only road into
Judah from Israel went through Ramah.
2 So Asa told his workers to take all the silver and gold that was in the storerooms
of the temple and in his own palace, and take and give it to Ben-Hadad, the king of
Syria, who was ruling in Damascus. He sent him a message, saying
3 “I want there to be a peace treaty between me and you, like there was between
my father and your father. Look, I am sending you a lot of silver and gold. So please
cancel the treaty that you have made with Baasha, the king of Israel, in order that
he will take his soldiers away from attacking mine, because he will be afraid of your
army.”
4 Ben-Hadad agreed to do what King Asa suggested. He sent the commanders of his
armies with their soldiers to attack some of the towns in Israel. They captured Ijon,
Dan, Abel-Beth-Maacah and all the cities in the area belonging to the tribe of Naphtali
where supplies were kept.
5 When Baasha heard about that, he commanded his troops to stop fortifying Ramah
and doing other work there.
6 Then King Asa gathered all the men of Judah, and they took away from Ramah
all the stones and timber that Baasha’s men had been using to build the wall around
that town. They took those materials to the town of Geba and the city of Mizpah north
of Jerusalem and built walls around them.
7 At that time the prophet Hanani went to King Asa and said to him, “Because you

on horses were certainly very powerful. But when you relied on Yahweh, he enabled
your army to defeat them.
9 That happened because Yahweh sees what is happening all over the earth, and he
strengthens those who completely trust him. You have done a very foolish thing, so
from now on other armies will be fighting your army.”
10 Asa was very angry with the prophet because of what the prophet had said. So
he commanded his officials to put Hanani in prison. At that same time, he started to
treat some of his people very cruelly.
2 CHRONICLES 16:11
641
2 CHRONICLES 17:13
11 All the things that Asa did while he was ruling, from the time he started to rule
until he died, are written in the scroll containing the record of the activities of the
kings of Judah and Israel.
12 When Asa had been ruling for almost 39 years, he was afflicted with a disease
in his feet. The disease was very severe, but in spite of that, he did not request help
from Yahweh. Instead he sought help only from doctors.
13 When he had been ruling for almost 40 years, he died.
14 He was buried in the tomb that his workers had made for him in the part of
Jerusalem called ‘The City of David’. They laid his corpse on a bed covered with
spices and various perfumes that had been mixed together. They also lit a huge fire
to honor him.
17
King Jehoshaphat’s rule in Judah
1 Asa’s son Jehoshaphat became the king of Judah, and he enabled his army to
become very strong, with the result that they could resist attacks from the army of
Israel.
2 He put soldiers in all the cities in Judah around which they had built walls, and
he put soldiers in other places in Judah and in the towns in the area belonging to the
tribe of Ephraim that soldiers of his father Asa had captured.
3 Yahweh helped Jehoshaphat because when he started to rule Judah, he did the
things that pleased Yahweh like his ancestor King David had done. He did not worship
the idols of Baal.
4 Instead, he sought advice from the God whom his father had worshiped, and
he obeyed God’s commands, and did not do the evil things that the kings of Israel
continually did.
5 Yahweh enabled him to completely control his kingdom. All the people of Judah
brought gifts to him, with the result that he became very rich and was greatly
honored.
6 He was completely devoted to doing what pleased Yahweh. His workers got
rid of the shrines on the hilltops and the poles for worshiping the goddess Asherah
7 When he had been ruling Judah for almost three years, he sent some of his
in various towns in Judah.
Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-Adonijah—and two
priests, Elishama and Jehoram.
9 They took with them a scroll on which were written the laws of Yahweh and
taught them to the people in all the towns throughout Judah,
10 The people in all the kingdoms surrounding Judah became very afraid of what
Yahweh might do to punish them if they fought against Judah, so they did not start
wars with Jehoshaphat’s army.
11 Some people from Philistia brought gifts to Jehoshaphat, and they also brought
to him the silver that he demanded that they pay to him. Some Arabs brought to him
7,700 rams and 7,700 goats.
12 Jehoshaphat continued to become more powerful/influential. His workers built
forts and places to store supplies in various towns in Judah.
13 Then they put large amounts of supplies in those storehouses.
Jehoshaphat also placed in Jerusalem soldiers who were experienced.
2 CHRONICLES 17:14
642
2 CHRONICLES 18:11
14 The leaders and numbers from each tribe were as follows:
From the tribe of Judah,
Adnah was the leader of the soldiers, and he commanded 300,000 soldiers.
15 His assistant was Jehohanan, who commanded 280,000 soldiers.
16 Next was Zicri’s son Amasiah, who volunteered to serve Yahweh in this way;
he commanded 200,000 soldiers.
17 From the tribe of Benjamin,
Eliada, who was a brave soldier, was the leader of the soldiers; he commanded
200,000 men who had bows and arrows and shields.
18 Next was Jehozabad, who commanded 180,000 men who had weapons for
fighting battles.
19 Those were the soldiers who served the king in Jerusalem, in addition to the men
whom the king had placed in the other cities in Judah that had walls around them.
18
The prophet Micaiah warned King Ahab of Israel
1 Jehoshaphat became very wealthy and was greatly honored. But then he arranged
for one of his family to marry someone from the family of King Ahab of Israel.
2 Several years later, he went down from Jerusalem to Samaria to visit Ahab. Ahab
welcomed him and the people who had come with him by slaughtering many sheep
and cattle for a feast.
3 Then he asked Jehoshaphat, “Will you and your army go with my army to attack
Ramoth city in the Gilead region?” Jehoshaphat replied, “My soldiers and I will go to
the battle when you tell us to go.”
4 Then he added, “But we should ask Yahweh first, to find out what he wants us to
do.”
5 So the king of Israel gathered all his 400 prophets and asked them, “Should we go
to attack the people of Ramoth city, or should we not do that?”
them.”
7 The king of Israel replied, “There is still one man here, whom we can ask to
find out what Yahweh wants, his name is Micaiah, the son of Imlah. But I hate him
because he never says anything good about me. He always predicts that bad things
will happen to me.”
Jehoshaphat replied, “King Ahab, you should not say that!”
8 So the king of Israel told one of his officials to summon Micaiah immediately.
9 The king of Israel and the king of Judah were sitting there on their thrones,
wearing their royal robes. They were at the place where people threshed grain,
near the gate of Samaria city. All of Ahab’s prophets were standing in front of them,
predicting what was going to happen.
10 One of them whose name was Zedekiah, the son of Kenaanah, had made from
iron something that resembled the horns of a bull. He proclaimed to Ahab, “This is
what Yahweh says: ‘With horns like these, your army will keep attacking the army of
Syria like a bull attacks another animal, until you completely destroy them.’ ”
11 All the other prophets of Ahab agreed. They said, “Yes! If you attack Ramoth city
in the Gilead region, you will be successful, because Yahweh will enable you to defeat
them.”
2 CHRONICLES 18:12
643
2 CHRONICLES 18:29
12 The messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, “Listen to me! All the
other prophets are unitedly predicting that the king will be successful in the battle.
So be sure to agree with them and say that the king’s army will be successful!”
13 But Micaiah said, “As surely as Yahweh lives, I will tell the king only what Yahweh
tells me to say.”
14 When Micaiah arrived, the king of Israel asked him, “Should we go to attack
Ramoth, or not?”
Micaiah replied, “Sure, go! Yahweh will enable your army to defeat them!”
15 But King Ahab realized that Micaiah was lying, so he said to Micaiah, “I have told
you many times that you must always tell only the truth when you say what Yahweh
has revealed to you!”
16 Then Micaiah replied, “The truth is that in a vision I saw all the troops of Israel
scattered on the mountains. They seemed to be like sheep that did not have a
shepherd. And Yahweh said, ‘Their master has been killed. So tell them all to go
home peacefully.’ ”
17 Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “I told you that he never predicts that anything good
will happen to me! He always predicts that bad things will happen to me.”
18 But Micaiah continued, saying, “Listen to what Yahweh showed to me! In a vision
I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, with all the armies of heaven standing around
him, on his right side and on his left side.
19 And Yahweh said, ‘Who can persuade Ahab, the king of Israel, to go to fight
against the people of Ramoth, in order that he may be killed there?’
“Some suggested one thing, and others suggested something else.
20 “Finally one spirit, having received a message from Satan, came to Yahweh and
said, ‘I can do it!’
“Yahweh asked him, ‘How will you do it?’
21 “The spirit replied, ‘I will go and inspire all of Ahab’s prophets to tell lies.’
Yahweh said, ‘You will be successful; go and do it!’
has decided that something terrible will happen to you.”
face. He said, “Do you think that Yahweh’s Spirit left me in order to speak to you?”
24 Micaiah replied, “You will find out for yourself to which of us Yahweh’s Spirit
has truly spoken on the day when you go into a room of some house to hide from the
Syrian soldiers!”
25 King Ahab commanded his soldiers, “Seize Micaiah and take him to Amon, the
governor of this city, and to my son Joash.
26 Tell them that I have commanded that they should put this man in prison and
give him only bread and water. Do not give him anything else to eat until I return
safely from the battle!”
27 Micaiah replied, “If you return safely, it will be clear that it was not Yahweh who
told me what to say to you!” Then he said to all those who were standing there, “Do
not forget what I have said to King Ahab!”
Ahab died in the battle at Ramoth-Gilead
28 So the king of Israel and the king of Judah led their armies to Ramoth, in the
Gilead region.
29 King Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “I will put on different clothes, in order that no
one will recognize that I am the king. But you should wear your royal robe.” So the
king of Israel disguised himself, and they both went into the battle.
2 CHRONICLES 18:30
644
2 CHRONICLES 19:11
30 The King of Syria told his soldiers who were driving the chariots, “Attack only
the king of Israel!”
31 So when the soldiers who were driving the Syrian chariots saw Jehoshaphat
wearing the royal robes, they thought “He must be the king of Israel!”
32 So they turned to attack him. But when Jehoshaphat cried out, Yahweh helped
him, and they realized that he was not the king of Israel. And God caused them to
stop pursuing him.
33 But one Syrian soldier shot an arrow at Ahab, without knowing that it was Ahab.
The arrow struck Ahab between the places where the parts of his armor joined
together. Ahab told the driver of his chariot, “Turn the chariot around and take
me out of here! I have been severely wounded!”
34 The battle continued all that day. Ahab was sitting propped up in his chariot,
facing the Syrian soldiers. And late in the afternoon, when the sun was setting, he
died.

for worshiping the goddess Asherah, and you have strongly determined to do what
Jehoshaphat appointed men to settle disputes
But one time, like he had done once previously,
he went out among all the people in the country, from Beersheba city in the far south
to the hilly area of the tribe of Ephraim in the far north, and he convinced them to
return to worshiping Yahweh, the God whom their ancestors worshiped.
5 He appointed judges throughout Judah, in each of the cities that had walls around
them.
6 He told them, “Make your decisions carefully, because you are judging cases not in
order to please people but to please Yahweh. And he will be watching you whenever
you make a decision.
7 So now revere Yahweh, and judge cases carefully, and do not forget that Yahweh
our God never acts unjustly, and he never does what people want because of their
offering him money; he never accepts bribes.”
8 In Jerusalem also, Jehoshaphat appointed some priests and other descendants
of Levi and some leaders of Israeli families to be judges. He told them to do what
Yahweh’s laws said was right when they settled disputes. Those men lived in
Jerusalem.
9 He told them this: “You must always do your work faithfully, revering Yahweh.
10 In every dispute that your fellow Israelis who live in the cities want you to settle,
you must warn them to not sin against Yahweh by telling lies during the trial. If you
do not warn them, God will punish both you and your fellow Israelis. If you warn
them, you will not be sinning. You must warn them whether someone has accused
them of murdering someone, or of disobeying some other law or command or decree
of Yahweh.
11 Amariah the Supreme Priest will supervise you in any matter that Yahweh is
concerned about, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the leader of the tribe of Judah,
will supervise you in any matter that I am responsible for. And the descendants of

Jehoshaphat’s army defeated armies from Moab and Ammon
1 Later armies from Moab and Ammon and some soldiers from the Meun area in
Edom came to fight against Jehoshaphat’s army.
2 Some men came and told Jehoshaphat, “A huge army is coming to attack your
army. They are coming from the Edom region, from the eastern side of the Dead Sea.
They have already come to Hazazon-Tamar!” Another name for that place is En-Gedi.
3 Jehoshaphat became very afraid, so he decided to ask Yahweh what he should do.
He also proclaimed that all the people of Judah should fast.
4 The people of Judah gathered together to request Yahweh to help them. They
came to Jerusalem from every town in Judah to seek help from Yahweh.
5 Then Jehoshaphat stood up in front of the people of Judah in front of the new
courtyard of the temple,
“Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors belonged to, you are surely the God who
power, and no one can successfully oppose you.
people advanced, and you certainly gave it to us who are descendants of your friend
8 We have lived here and have built a temple where we, your people, worship
you. We said,
9 'If we experience disasters, either from our enemies attacking us or from you
punishing us, or if we experience a plague or a famine, we will stand in your presence
in front of this temple that is built to honor you, and we will cry out to you when we
are distressed/suffering, and you will hear us and will rescue us.'
10 You would not allow our Israeli ancestors to enter the countries of Ammon and
Moab and Edom when they were traveling from Egypt to Canaan. So our ancestors
turned away from those areas and did not attack the people there and did not
destroy them. But now they are coming here to attack us.
11 We did not destroy them. But now look at how they are repaying us by trying
to expel us from the land that you gave to our ancestors to belong to them and their
descendants forever
12 So, our God, please punish them, because we do not have enough power to
resist/defeat this huge army that is coming to attack us. We do not know what to do.
But we are pleading for you to help us.”
13 All the men of Judah and their wives and children and babies were standing
there in the presence of Yahweh while Jehoshaphat prayed.
14 Then the Spirit of Yahweh came upon Jahaziel, who was the son of Zechariah,
who was the son of Benaiah, who was the son of Jeiel, who was the son of Mattaniah.
He was a descendant of Levi and a descendant of Asaph. He stood up in front of the
whole group that was gathered there,
15 and said, “King Jehoshaphat and all you who live in Jerusalem and in other places
in Judah, listen! This is what Yahweh says to you: ‘Do not be afraid or discouraged
because of this huge army that is coming to attack you, because it is not you who will
win this battle. It is God who will win it.

2 CHRONICLES 20:31
16 Tomorrow march down toward them. They will be climbing up through Ziz Pass
north of En-Gedi. You will meet them at the end of the gorge near the Jeruel Desert.
places in Judah, just take your positions, and then stand still and watch what will
toward them tomorrow, and Yahweh will be with you.’ ”
18 Jehoshaphat prostrated himself with his face touching the ground, and all the
people of Jerusalem and other places in Judah who were there knelt down to worship
Yahweh.
19 Then some descendants of Levi who were descendants of both Kohath and Korah
stood up and loudly praised Yahweh, the God whom the Israelis belonged to.
20 Early the next morning the army left to go to the desert near Tekoa town. While
they were leaving, Jehoshaphat stood up and said to the people, “You people of
Jerusalem and other places in Judah, listen to me! Trust in Yahweh our God; if you
do that, you will be strong. Trust in what his prophets have said; if you do that, you
will be successful.”
21 Then, after consulting with some of the people, he appointed some men to go in
wonderful. They were singing,
because he faithfully loves us forever.”
22 When they began to sing and praise Yahweh, Yahweh caused the soldiers from
Ammon and Moab and Edom who were invading Judah to panic, with the result that
they were defeated.
23 The soldiers from Ammon and Moab started to fight against the soldiers from
Edom, and they completely annihilated the soldiers from Edom. After they finished
slaughtering the men from Edom, they started to attack each other.
24 When the soldiers from Judah came to the place where they could look down
over the desert, they looked toward that huge army of their enemies, and they saw
only corpses lying on the ground. No one had survived.
25 So Jehoshaphat and his soldiers went to take the possessions of their enemies, and
they saw that there was a lot of equipment and clothing and other valuable things;
there was more than they could carry away. There were very many things, with the
result that it took three days for them to collect it all.
26 The following day they gathered in Beracah Valley and praised Yahweh there.
That is why that valley is still called Beracah, which means praise.
27 Then while Jehoshaphat led them, all the soldiers who were from Jerusalem and
other places in Judah returned to Jerusalem. They were happy because Yahweh had
enabled them to defeat their enemies.
28 When they arrived at Jerusalem, they went to the temple, playing harps and lutes
and trumpets.
29 People in the kingdoms of the nearby countries became very afraid when they
heard how Yahweh had fought against the enemies of the Israelis.
30 Then there was peace in the kingdom that was ruled by Jehoshaphat, because
God had caused the surrounding nations not to attack it.
The final years that Jehoshaphat ruled
31 Jehoshaphat continued to rule Judah. He was 35 years old when he became king
of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for 25 years. His mother’s name was Azubah,
the daughter of Shilhi.
2 CHRONICLES 20:32
647
2 CHRONICLES 21:12
32 He did things that were pleasing to Yahweh, like his father Asa had done, and he
did not stop doing those things.
33 But he did not get rid of the shrines on the hilltops, and many of the people still
did not faithfully do what the God whom their ancestors belonged to wanted.
34 A record of the other things that Jehoshaphat did while he ruled, from when he
began to rule until he died, is in the scrolls written by the prophet Jehu, the son of
Hanani. They are also in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Israel.
35 During his reign, Jehoshaphat made a treaty with Ahaziah, the king of Israel, who
was a very wicked king.
36 They agreed that their workers would build a fleet of ships to use to buy and sell
things with other countries. After those ships were built at Ezion-Geber on the Gulf of
37 Eliezer the son of Dodavahu from Mareshah city warned Jehoshaphat. He said,
will destroy the ships that your workers have made.” And the ships were wrecked,
and were not able to sail to other countries.
21
1 Then Jehoshaphat died, and was buried where his ancestors were buried in the
part of Jerusalem called ‘The City of David’. Then his son Jehoram became the king
of Judah.
2 His younger brothers were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and
Shephatiah.
3 Before Jehoshaphat died, he gave them gifts of silver and gold and other valuable
things. He also appointed them to rule various cities in Judah that had walls around
them. But he appointed Jehoram to be the king of Judah, because Jehoram was his
oldest son.
King Jehoram of Judah
4 After Jehoram was completely in control of his father’s kingdom, he had all of his
younger brothers executed, along with some of the leaders of the nation.
5 Jehoram was 32 years old when he became the king, and he ruled in Jerusalem
for eight years.
6 But he did many of the evil things that the kings of Israel had done. He did many
things that Yahweh considers to be evil, things that the family of Ahab had done,
because he married one of Ahab’s daughters.
7 However, because of the agreement that Yahweh had made with King David,
Yahweh did not want to get rid of the descendants of David. He had promised that
David’s descendants would always be the ones who ruled Judah.
8 While Jehoram was ruling, the people of the Edom region rebelled against the king
of Judah and appointed their own king.
9 So Jehoram and his officers and his men in chariots went to Edom. There, the
army of Edom surrounded them. Jehoram escaped during the night.
10 But the king of Judah was never able to regain control of Edom, and Edom is still
not controlled by Judah. The people in Libnah city between Judah and Philistia also
rebelled against Judah. Those things happened because Jehoram turned away from
obeying Yahweh, the God whom his ancestors belonged to.
11 On the hilltops in Judah he had also built shrines to worship idols, and had caused
the people of Judah to stray away from Yahweh by worshiping foreign gods.
12 One day, Jehoram received a letter from the prophet Elijah. Elijah had written
this in the letter:
2 CHRONICLES 21:13
648
2 CHRONICLES 22:8
“This is what Yahweh, the God whom your ancestor King David worshiped, says:
'You have not done things that please me like your father Jehoshaphat did or what
13 Instead, you have continually done the evil things that the kings of Israel have
worshiping Yahweh, like the descendants of Ahab did. You have also murdered your
14 So now Yahweh is about to very severely punish the people in your kingdom
and even your own children and your wives and everything that you own.
15 And you yourself will have an intestinal disease that will continue to become
worse, and you will suffer from it until you die.' ”
16 Then Yahweh caused some men from the Philistia people-group and some Arabs
who lived near the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, where people from Ethiopia had
settled, to become angry with Jehoram.
17 Their army invaded Judah and took away from Jerusalem all the valuable things
that they found in the king’s palace, and even his sons and wives. His youngest son,
18 After that happened, Yahweh caused Jehoram to be afflicted with an intestinal
disease that no one could cure.
19 About two years later, while he was in great pain, he died because of that disease.
The people of Judah had made bonfires to honor his ancestors when they died, but
they did not make a bonfire for Jehoram.
20 Jehoram was 32 years old when he became the king, and he ruled in Jerusalem
for eight years. No one was sorry when he died. His corpse was buried in the part of
Jerusalem called ‘The City of David’, but he was not buried where the other kings of
Judah had been buried.
22
King Ahaziah of Judah
1 The people of Jerusalem appointed Jehoram’s youngest son Ahaziah as their king,
because the men from Philistia who had invaded Judah with some Arabs had killed
all of Jehoram’s other sons. So Ahaziah started to rule Judah.
2 Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for one
year. His mother’s name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of King Omri of Israel.
3 King Ahaziah conducted his life just like the members of Ahab’s family had done,
because his mother encouraged him to do things that are evil.
4 He did things that Yahweh considers to be evil, like the descendants of Ahab had
done, because after Ahaziah’s father died, they became his advisors. And Ahaziah
died as a result of heeding their bad advice.
5 He also did what they advised when he went with Joram, the son of King Ahab of
Israel, to fight against the army of Hazael, the king of Syria, at Ramoth-Gilead.
6 Then King Ahaziah went down to Jezreel city to see Joram, the son of King Ahab,
because he had been wounded.
7 It was during that visit that God caused Ahaziah to die. When Ahaziah arrived,
he went with Joram to meet Jehu, the son of Nimshi, whom Yahweh had appointed
to kill all the descendants of Ahab.
8 While Jehu and the men who were with him were killing the descendants of Ahab,
they found the leaders of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s relatives who had been
working for Ahaziah, and they killed all of them.
2 CHRONICLES 22:9
649
his corpse, because they said, “He deserves to be buried, because he was a descendant
of Jehoshaphat, who tried hard to please Yahweh.” There were no descendants of
Ahaziah who were powerful enough to become the kings of Judah.
Athaliah and Joash
10 When Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, saw that her son had been killed, she
commanded that all the members of Ahaziah’s family who might become king must
be executed.
11 But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram, took Joash, Ahaziah’s very young
son, away from the other sons of the king who were about to be murdered, and she
hid him and his nursemaid in a bedroom in the temple. Because Jehosheba, who
was the daughter of King Jehoram and the wife of the Supreme Priest Jehoiada, was
Ahaziah’s sister, she hid the child, with the result that Athaliah could not kill him.
12 He remained hidden there for six years while Athaliah ruled Judah.
23
The revolt against Athaliah
1 After Joash had been hidden in the temple for six years, Jehoiada the priest decided
that it was necessary to do something. So he made an agreement with the army
commanders of groups of 100 soldiers: Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son
of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat
the son of Zicri.
2 They went throughout Judah and gathered the descendants of Levi and the leaders
of Israeli families from all the towns. When they came to Jerusalem,
3 the whole group went to the temple and made an agreement with the young king
there. Jehoiada said to them, “This is the son of the previous king of Judah. So he
is the one who must rule, like Yahweh promised that the descendants of King David
must do.
4 “So this is what you must do: One-third of you priests and other descendants of
Levi who are starting their work on the Sabbath day must guard the doors of the
temple.
5 One-third of you must guard the king’s palace, and one-third of you must guard
the Foundation Gate. All the other people will be in the courtyards outside the temple.
6 Only the priests and the descendants of Levi who work there will enter the temple.
They will be allowed to enter the temple because they are set apart for that work. All
the others must remain in the courtyards, obeying what Yahweh has commanded.
7 You descendants of Levi must stand around the young king, each of you with your
weapon in your hand. Anyone else who tries to enter the temple you must kill. And
stay close to the young king, wherever he goes.”
8 So the descendants of Levi and all the men of Judah did what Jehoiada had told
them. He did not allow anyone to go home after having finished his work on that
Sabbath day. Each commander took charge of his men, the ones who were finishing
their work on that day and those who were starting their work on that day.
9 Then Jehoiada gave each of the commanders the spears and the large and small
shields that had been put there in the temple by King David.
10 He commanded all the guards to stand in their positions, each with his sword in
his hand, all around the king—around the altar and the temple, from the north side
to the south side.
2 CHRONICLES 23:11
650
2 CHRONICLES 24:6
11 Then Jehoiada and his sons brought Joash out. They put a crown on his head and
gave him a scroll on which were written the rules that the kings needed to obey, and
proclaimed that he was now the king. They anointed him with olive oil and shouted,
“We hope that the king will live for many years!”
12 When Athaliah heard the noise being made by the people running toward the
king and cheering, she ran to the temple.
13 She saw the young king there, standing alongside the pillar at the entrance
of the temple, which is the place at the temple where the kings usually stood. The
army commanders and trumpet players were standing beside the king, and all the
people of Judah were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and singers with their musical
instruments were leading the people while they praised God. Then Athaliah tore her
robes and started screaming, “You are committing treason!”
14 Jehoiada the Supreme Priest said to the army commanders, “Kill her, but do not
kill her at the temple of Yahweh!” Then he said to them, “Bring Athaliah out in front
of the troops and kill anyone who tries to follow her!”
15 She tried to flee, but they seized her as she reached the gate where horses enter
the palace area, and they killed her there.
16 Then Jehoiada made an agreement that he and the king and all the other people
would be Yahweh’s people.
17 Then all the people who were there went to the temple of Baal and tore it down.
They smashed the altars of Baal. They also killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front
of those altars.
18 Then Jehoiada appointed the priests, who were also descended from Levi, to work
at the temple. They were part of the group to whom King David had given various
jobs at the temple, to sacrifice the animals that were to be completely burned on the
altar, doing what was written in the laws that Moses had given to them. He also told
them to rejoice and sing, which was also what David had commanded.
19 He also put guards at the gates of the temple in order that anyone who was
unacceptable to God would not be allowed to enter.
20 Jehoiada took with him the army commanders, the important men, the leaders
and many others, and brought the king down from the temple. They went into the
palace through the Upper Gate, and put the king on his throne.
21 Then all the people of Judah rejoiced. And there was calm throughout the city,
because Athaliah had been killed.
24
King Joash of Judah
1 Joash was seven years old when he became the king of Judah, and he ruled in
Jerusalem for 40 years. His mother’s name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba city.
2 Joash did what pleased Yahweh as long as Jehoiada was the Supreme Priest.
3 Jehoiada chose two women to be Joash’s wives. And they bore Joash sons and
daughters.
4 Some years later, Joash decided that the temple should be repaired.
5 He summoned the priests and other descendants of Levi and said to them, “Go to
the towns in Judah and collect from the people the tax money that they are required to
But the descendants of Levi did not do it immediately.
descendants of Levi to bring to Jerusalem from various places in Judah the annual/
2 CHRONICLES 24:7
651
2 CHRONICLES 24:21
yearly tax that Moses said that the people of Judah must pay, for taking care of the
Sacred Tent?”
7 The temple needed to be repaired because the sons of that wicked woman Athaliah
had entered into the temple and had wrecked some of the things, and had also used
some of the sacred items that were in it for the worship of Baal.
8 So, obeying what the king commanded, the descendants of Levi made a chest and
placed it outside the temple, at one of the entrances.
9 Then the king sent letters everywhere in Judah, requesting everyone to bring their
tax money to the temple, like Moses had required the Israeli people to do when they
were in the desert.
10 All the officials and the other people agreed, and they brought their contributions
gladly. They put the money into the chest until it was full.
11 Whenever the descendants of Levi brought the chest to the king’s officials, and
they saw that there was a lot of money in it, the king’s secretary and the assistant
to the Supreme Priest would take all the money from the chest, and then put the
chest back in its place. They did this frequently, and they collected a huge amount of
money.
12 The king and Jehoiada gave the money to the men who were supervising the work
of repairing the temple. Those men hired stoneworkers and carpenters to repair the
temple. They also hired men who worked with iron and bronze to repair things in
the temple that were broken.
13 The men who did the repair work worked hard, and the work of repairing the
temple progressed. They rebuilt the temple so that it was like it was originally, and
they even made it stronger.
14 When they had finished the repair work, they brought to the king and to Jehoiada
the money that they had not used for the repairs. That money was used to make
things to use for offering the sacrifices that were completely burned on the altar, and
to make bowls and other gold and silver things for the temple. As long as Joash lived,
the people continually brought to the temple sacrifices that were to be completely
burned on the altar.
15 Jehoiada lived to become very old. He died when he was 130 years old.
16 He was buried where the kings had been buried, in the part of Jerusalem called
‘The City of David’. He was buried there because of the good things that he had done
in Judah for God and for God’s temple.
Joash and the people of Judah turned away from Yahweh
17 After Jehoiada died, the leaders of Judah went to Joash, bowed in front of him,
and persuaded him to do what they wanted.
18 So they and the other people stopped worshiping at the temple, and they started
worshiping the poles dedicated to the goddess Asherah and other idols. Because of
their doing those sinful things, God was very angry with the people of Jerusalem and
with the people in other places in Judah.
19 Although Yahweh sent prophets to persuade them to return to him, and although
not pay attention.
He stood up front of the people and said, “This is what God says: ‘Why are you
disobeying what I, Yahweh, have commanded? You have abandoned me, so I will
abandon you.’ ”
21 But the people planned to kill Zechariah. And the king joined them in doing it.
The people killed Zechariah by throwing stones at him in the temple courtyard.
2 CHRONICLES 24:22
652
2 CHRONICLES 25:7
22 King Joash had forgotten about how Zechariah’s father Jehoiada had been kind
to him. That’s why he gave orders for the people to kill Jehoiada’s son Zechariah,
who said as he was dying, “I hope that Yahweh will see what you are doing to me and
punish you for doing it.”
23 Near the end of that year (OR, early in the following year), the army of Syria
marched to attack the army of Joash. They invaded Judah and attacked Jerusalem
and killed all the leaders of the people. They seized many valuable things and sent
them to their king in Damascus, their capital city.
24 The army of Syria that came to Judah was very small, but Yahweh allowed them to
defeat the large army of Judah, because he was punishing Joash and the other people
of Judah for having abandoned him, the God whom their ancestors worshiped.
25 Before the battle ended, Joash was severely wounded. Then his officials decided
to kill him for murdering Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada the Supreme Priest. They
killed him while he was in his bed. He was buried in the part of Jerusalem called ‘The
City of David’, but they did not bury him in the place where the other kings had been
buried.
26 Those who conspired to kill him were Zabad the son of Shimeath, who was a
woman from the Ammon people-group, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith, who was
a woman from the Moab people-group.
27 An account of the things that were done by the sons of Joash and the many
prophecies about Joash and what he did to repair the temple are written in the scroll
called ‘the History of the Kings of Judah and Israel’. Then after Joash died, Amaziah
his son became the king.
25
King Amaziah of Judah
1 Amaziah was 25 years old when he became the king of Judah, and he ruled from
Jerusalem for 29 years. His mother was Jehoaddin; she was from Jerusalem.
2 Amaziah did many things that pleased Yahweh, but he did not do them
enthusiastically.
3 As soon as he was in complete control of his kingdom, he caused to be executed
the officials who had murdered his father.
4 But he did not command their sons to be executed; he obeyed what was in the
laws that Moses had written. In those laws Yahweh had commanded, “People must
executed for what their parents have done. People must be executed only for the sins
5 Amaziah summoned the men of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin to come to
Jerusalem, and there he put them in groups, each clan in a group by themselves.
Then he appointed officers to command each group. Some officers commanded 100
men and some commanded 1,000 men. They counted the men who were at least 20
years old; altogether there were 300,000 men. They were all men who were prepared
to be in the army, and able to fight well, using spears and shields.
6 Amaziah also hired 100,000 capable soldiers from Israel and paid almost four tons
of silver for them.
7 But a prophet came to him and said, “Your majesty, you must not allow those
soldiers from Israel to march with your soldiers, because Yahweh does not help the
people of the tribe of Ephraim or from anywhere else in Israel.
2 CHRONICLES 25:8
653
2 CHRONICLES 25:23
8 Even if your soldiers go and fight courageously in battles, God will cause your
enemies to defeat you; do not forget that God has the power to help armies or to
cause them to be defeated.”
9 Amaziah asked that prophet, “If I do that, what about the huge amount of silver
that I paid to hire those soldiers from Israel?”
The prophet replied, “Yahweh is able to pay you back more money than you paid
to hire those soldiers.”
10 So Amaziah told those soldiers from Israel to return home. They left to go home,
but they were very angry with the king of Judah for not allowing them to stay and
fight.
11 Then Amaziah became brave, and he led his army to the Salt Valley. There they
killed 10,000 men from the Edom people-group.
12 The army of Judah also captured 10,000 others, and took them to the top of a
cliff and threw them all down over the cliff, with the result that their corpses were
all smashed to pieces.
13 While that was happening, the soldiers from Israel whom Amaziah had sent
home after not allowing them to fight along with his soldiers, raided cities and towns
in Judea, from Samaria city to Beth-Horon town. They killed 3,000 people and took
away a great amount of valuable things.
14 When Amaziah returned to Jerusalem after his army had slaughtered the soldiers
from Edom, he brought the idols that were worshiped by the people of Edom. He set
them up to be his own gods. Then he bowed down to worship them and offered
sacrifices to them.
15 Because of that, Yahweh was very angry with Amaziah. He sent a prophet to
him, who said, “Why do you worship these foreign gods that were not even able to
save their own people when your army attacked them?”
16 While he was still speaking, the king said to him, “We certainly did not appoint
you to be one of my advisors. So stop talking! If you say anything more, I will tell my
soldiers to kill you!”
So the prophet said, “I know that God has determined to get rid of you, because
you have begun to worship idols, and have not heeded my advice.” Then the prophet

wanted Jehoash’s army to defeat them, because they were worshiping the gods of
21 So Jehoash’s army attacked. Their two armies faced each other at Beth-Shemesh
city in Judah.
22 The army of Judah was badly defeated by the army of Israel, and all the soldiers
of Judah fled to their homes.
23 King Jehoash’s army also captured King Amaziah there.
Then he brought
Amaziah to Jerusalem, and his soldiers tore down the wall that was around the city,
2 CHRONICLES 25:24
654
2 CHRONICLES 26:13
from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate. That was a section that was about 600
feet long.
24 His soldiers also carried away the gold and silver and other valuable furnishings
from the temple which the descendants of Obed-Edom had previously been guarding.
They also took away the valuable things in the palace, and they took to Samaria some
prisoners whom they had captured.
25 King Jehoash of Israel died, and King Amaziah of Judah lived for 15 years after
that.
26 An account of all the other things that Amaziah did while he was the king of
Judah is written in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel’.
27 From the time that Amaziah started to disobey Yahweh, some men in Jerusalem
planned to kill him. He was able to escape to Lachish city, but those who wanted to
kill him sent another group of people to Lachish and killed him there.
28 They put his corpse on a horse and brought it back to Jerusalem and buried
it where his ancestors had been buried in the part of Jerusalem called ‘The City of
David’.
26
King Uzziah of Judah
1-2 After King Amaziah died, all the people of Judah appointed his son Uzziah, who
then was 16 years old, as their king. One of the things that happened while he was
the king was that his men captured Elath town on the Gulf of Aqaba and rebuilt it.
3 Uzziah ruled in Jerusalem for 52 years. His mother was Jecoliah; she was from
Jerusalem.
4 Uzziah did things that Yahweh considered to be good, like his father Amaziah had
done.
5 He tried to please God while the priest Zechariah was living, because Zechariah
taught him to revere God. As long as Uzziah tried to please God, God enabled him to
be successful.
6 Uzziah and his army started to fight against the army of Philistia. They tore down

Gate, and at the place where the wall turns, and they placed weapons in them.
to provide water for a lot of the king’s cattle that were in the foothills and in the
plains. Uzziah liked farming, so he also stationed workers to take care of his fields
and vineyards in the hills and in the fertile areas.
11 Uzziah’s army was trained for fighting battles. They were in groups that were
always ready to go into battle. Jeiel, the king’s secretary, and Maaseiah, one of the
army officers, counted the men and placed them in groups. Hananiah, one of the
king’s officials, was their commander.
12 There were 2,600 leaders of those groups of soldiers.
13 In the groups that those leaders commanded there were a total of 307,500 welltrained soldiers. It was a very powerful army which was ready to help the king fight
against his enemies.
2 CHRONICLES 26:14
655
2 CHRONICLES 27:6
14 Uzziah gave to each soldier a shield, a spear, a helmet, a vest made of iron plates,
a bow and arrows, and a slingshot.
15 In Jerusalem his skilled workers made machines to put on the watchtowers and
on the corners of the walls, to shoot arrows and to hurl large stones. He became very
famous even in distant places, because God helped him very much and enabled him
to become very powerful.
16 But because Uzziah was very powerful, he became very proud, and that led to
his being punished. He disobeyed what Yahweh his God had commanded. He went
into the temple to burn incense on the altar where God had said that only the priests
should burn incense.
17 Azariah the Supreme Priest and 80 other brave priests followed him into the
temple.
18 They rebuked him and said to him, “Uzziah, it is not right for you to burn incense
to honor Yahweh. That duty is only for the priests, those who are descendants
of Aaron our first Supreme Priest! You must leave immediately, because you have
disobeyed Yahweh our God, and he will not honor you for what you have done!”
19 Uzziah had in his hand a pan for burning incense. He became very angry with
the priests, but suddenly there was leprosy on his forehead.
20 When Azariah the Supreme Priest and all the other priests who were there looked
at him, they saw the leprosy on his forehead, so they quickly took him outside. And
truly the king was eager to leave the temple, because he knew that it was Yahweh
who had caused him to have that leprosy, and he did not want it to become worse.
21 King Uzziah had leprosy until he died. And because he had leprosy, he lived in a
house that was not near other houses, and he was not allowed to enter the courtyard
of the temple. His son Jotham supervised the palace and ruled the people of Judah.
22 A record of all the other things that Uzziah did while he was the king of Judah
was written by the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz.
23 Because Uzziah was a leper, when he died, they would not bury him in the tombs
where the other kings were buried. Instead, he was buried in a nearby cemetery that
the kings owned. Then his son Jotham became the king of Judah.
27
King Jotham of Judah
1 Jotham was 25 years old when he became the king of Judah.
He ruled from
Jerusalem for 16 years. His mother was Jerushah, the daughter of the priest Zadok.
2 Jotham did many things that pleased Yahweh like his father Uzziah did. He obeyed
Yahweh and did things that are right. He did many things that his father Uzziah had
done, but he did not burn incense in the temple, like his father had done. However,
the people of Judah continued to sin against Yahweh.
3 Jotham’s workers rebuilt the Upper Gate of the temple, and they did a lot of work
to repair the wall near Ophel Hill.
4 They built towns in the hills of Judah, and they built forts and defense towers in
the forests.
5 During the time that Jotham was the king of Judah, his army attacked and defeated
the army of the Ammon people-group. Then, every year during the next three years,
he required the Anmon people-group to pay to him four tons of silver, 60,000 bushels
of wheat, and 60,000 bushels of barley.
6 Jotham faithfully obeyed Yahweh his God, and as a result he became a very
powerful king.
2 CHRONICLES 27:7
656
2 CHRONICLES 28:14
7 A record of everything else that Jotham did during the time that he was the king,
including the wars that his army fought, is written in the scroll called ‘the History of
the Kings of Israel and Judah’.
8 After Jotham had ruled Judah for 16 years, he died when he was 41 years old.
King Ahaz of Judah
1 Ahaz was 20 years old when he became the king of Judah. He ruled from Jerusalem
for 16 years. His ancestor King David was a good king, but Ahaz was not like David.
He constantly disobeyed Yahweh
2 and was as sinful as the kings of Israel had been. He made idols of the god Baal.
3 He burned incense in Hinnom Valley. He even killed some of his own sons and
offered them as sacrifices to be completely burned. That imitated the disgusting
customs of the people-groups who previously lived there, people whom Yahweh had
expelled as the Israelis advanced through the land.
4 Ahaz offered sacrifices to idols at shrines on hilltops and under every big green
tree.
5 Therefore Yahweh his God allowed his army to be defeated by the army of the
king of Syria. They captured many soldiers of Judah and took them as prisoners to
Damascus.
The army of the king of Israel also defeated the army of Judah and killed very many
of their soldiers.
6 In one day the army of Remaliah’s son, King Pekah of Israel, killed 120,000 soldiers
in Judah. That happened because the people of Judah had abandoned Yahweh, the
God whom their ancestors worshiped.
7 Zicri, a warrior from the tribe of Ephraim, killed king Ahaz’s son Maaseiah,
Azrikam the officer in charge of the palace, and Elkanah, the king’s assistant.
8 The soldiers of Israel captured 200,000 of the people of Judah, including many
wives and sons and daughters of the soldiers of Judah. They also seized and took
back to Samaria many valuable things.
9 But a prophet of Yahweh whose name was Obed was there in Samaria. He went
out of the city to meet the army when it returned to Samaria. He said to them,
“Because Yahweh, the God whom your ancestors belonged to, was angry with the
people of Judah, he allowed you to defeat them. But God has seen the cruel way that
you slaughtered them.
10 And now you want to sin by causing men and women from Judah to become your
slaves, but you have certainly also sinned against Yahweh our God!
11 So listen to me! Send back to Judah your fellow-countrymen whom you have
captured, because Yahweh is extremely angry with you for what you did to them.”
12 Then some of the leaders of the tribe of Ephraim—Azariah the son of Jehohanan,
Berekiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son
of Hadlai—rebuked those who were returning from the battle.
13 They said to them, “You must not bring those prisoners here! If you do that,
Yahweh will consider that we are guilty of sinning. We are already guilty of
committing many sins; do you want to cause us to be even more guilty by committing
another sin? God is already very angry with us people of Israel!”
14 So, while their leaders and others were watching, the soldiers released the
prisoners, and also gave back to them the valuable things that they had captured.
2 CHRONICLES 28:15
657
2 CHRONICLES 29:4
They also gave to the prisoners sandals and other clothes and things to eat and drink,
and they gave them olive oil to rub on their wounds. They gave donkeys to those
who were very weak, in order that they could ride on them. Then they led them all
to Jericho, the city that had many palm trees. Then those leaders of Israel returned
to Samaria.
16 About that time, King Ahaz sent a message to the king of Assyria requesting help.
17 He did that because the army from the Edom people-group had come again and
attacked Judah and taken away many of the people of Judah as prisoners.
18 At the same time, men from Philistia had raided/attacked towns in the foothills
and in the southern desert of Judah. They had captured Beth-Shemesh, Aijalon, and
Gederoth cities, as well as Soco, Timnah and Gimzo towns and the nearby villages.
19 Yahweh allowed those things to happen in order to humble king Ahaz, because he
had encouraged the people of Judah to do wicked things and had disobeyed Yahweh
very much.
20 Tiglath-Pileser, the king of Assyria, sent his army saying that they would help
Ahaz, but instead of helping him, they caused him to experience trouble.
21 Ahaz’s soldiers took some of the valuable things from the temple and from the
king’s palace and from other leaders of Judah and sent them to the king of Assyria
to pay him to help them, but the king of Assyria refused to help Ahaz.
22 While King Ahaz was experiencing those troubles, he disobeyed Yahweh even
more.
23 He offered sacrifices to the gods that were worshiped in Damascus, whose army
had defeated his army. He thought, “The gods that are worshiped by the kings of
Syria have helped them, so I will offer sacrifices to those gods in order that they will
help me.” But worshiping those gods caused Ahaz and all of Israel to be ruined.
24 Ahaz gathered all the furnishings that were used in the temple and broke them
into pieces. He locked the doors of the temple and set up altars for worshiping idols
at every street corner in Jerusalem.
25 In every town in Judah, his workers built shrines to burn sacrifices to other gods,
and that caused Yahweh, the God whom their ancestors worshiped, to be very angry.
26 A record of the other things that Ahaz did while he was the king, from when he
started to rule until he died, is written in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings
of Judah and Israel’.
27 Ahaz died and was buried in Jerusalem, but he was not buried in the tombs
where the other kings had been buried. Then his son Hezekiah became the king.
29
King Hezekiah of Judah
1 Hezekiah was 25 years old when he became the king of Judah.
He ruled from
Jerusalem for 29 years. His mother was Abijah, the daughter of a man whose name
was Zechariah.
2 Hezekiah did things that Yahweh considered to be right, like his ancestor King
David had done.
Hezekiah purified the temple
3 During March of the first year that Hezekiah was ruling Judah, he unlocked the
4 Then he gathered the priests and other descendants of Levi in the area on the east
658
2 CHRONICLES 29:20
5 and he said to them, “You descendants of Levi, listen to me! Consecrate yourselves.
And then consecrate the temple of Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors worshiped/
belonged to. Remove from the temple all the things that are not pleasing to God.
6 Our ancestors disobeyed God; they did many things that he considered to be evil,
things that were not pleasing to him. They abandoned this place where Yahweh lives,
and they have turned away from him.
7 They locked the doors of the temple and extinguished the lamps. They did not
burn any incense, and they did not offer any sacrifices that were to be completely
burned on the altar.
8 Therefore, Yahweh has become very angry with us people of Jerusalem and other
places in Judah, and he has caused other people to become frightened and horrified
when they hear what Yahweh did to punish us. And they ridicule us. You know this
very well.
9 That is why our fathers have been killed in battles, and our sons and daughters
and our wives have been captured and taken to other countries.
10 But now I intend to make an agreement with Yahweh, our God, in order that he
will no longer be angry with us.
11 You who are like my sons, do not waste any time. Do immediately what Yahweh
wants you to do. Yahweh has chosen you to stand in his presence and offer sacrifices
and burn incense.”
12 Then these descendants of Levi started to work in the temple:
From the descendants of Kohath there were Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel
the son of Azariah.
From the descendants of Merari there were Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the
son of Jehallelel.
From the descendants of Gershon there were Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden
the son of Joah.
13 From the descendants of Elizaphan there were Shimri and Jeiel.
From the descendants of Asaph there were Zechariah and Mattaniah.
14 From the descendants of Heman there were Jehiel and Shimei.
From the descendants of Jeduthun there were Shemaiah and Uzziel.
15 When those men had gathered their fellow descendants of Levi and had
consecrated themselves, they entered the temple in order to consecrate it. That was
what the king had commanded them to do, and they were also obeying what Yahweh
had commanded.
16 The priests entered the temple to consecrate it. They brought out into the
courtyard of the temple everything that they had found in the temple that was not
pleasing to Yahweh. Then the descendants of Levi took those things down to the
Kidron Valley and burned them there.
17 The priests and other descendants of Levi started this work on the first day of
March and finished purifying the courtyard of the temple on the eighth day of that
month, and they finished purifying the temple one week later.
18 Then they went to King Hezekiah and reported, “We have purified all parts of
the temple, and the altar where sacrifices are completely burned, and all the items
used at the altar, the table on which the priests place the sacred bread, and the things
19 While Ahaz was our king, he disobeyed what Yahweh had commanded, and he
them back and placed them in front of the sacred altar.”
20 Early the next morning, King Hezekiah gathered together the city officials, and
they went to the courtyard of the temple.
2 CHRONICLES 29:21
659
2 CHRONICLES 29:34
21 They took with them seven bulls, seven rams, seven male lambs, and seven male
goats to be an offering in order that Yahweh would forgive the sins of all the people
in the kingdom of Judah, and in order to purify the temple. The king commanded
that the priests, who were descendants of Aaron, should offer those animals to be
sacrificed to Yahweh on the altar.
22 So first the priests slaughtered those bulls, and took their blood and sprinkled it
on the altar. Then they slaughtered the rams and sprinkled their blood on the altar.
Then they slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled their blood on the altar.
23 The goats that were slaughtered to be an offering in order that Yahweh would
forgive the sins of the people were brought to the king and the others who were there.
Then the king and those who were present laid their hands on those goats.
24 Then the priests slaughtered those goats and splashed their blood on the altar in
order that Yahweh would forgive the sins that all the Israeli people had committed.
The priests did that because the king had commanded that offerings that would be
completely burned on the altar and other sacrifices should be made for all the people
of Israel.
25 The king then told the descendants of Levi to stand in the temple with their
cymbals and harps and lyres, obeying what David and his prophets Gad and Nathan
had commanded. Those were things that Yahweh had told his prophets that the
descendants of Levi should do.
26 So the descendants of Levi went and stood in the temple, ready to play the musical
instruments that King David had given to them. And the priests were ready to blow
their trumpets.
27 Then
Hezekiah told some of the priests to burn the animals that would be
sacrificed on the altar. When they started to burn the animals, the people started
to sing to praise Yahweh, while the other descendants of Levi were playing their
instruments.
28 All the people who were there bowed to worship Yahweh, while the singers sang
and the trumpeters blew their trumpets. They continued to do this until they had
finished slaughtering all the animals that would be completely burned.
29 When they finished making those offerings, the king and all those who were
there knelt down and worshiped Yahweh.
30 Then King Hezekiah and his officials commanded the descendants of Levi to
So they sang songs joyfully and bowed their heads to worship.
So come
close to the temple and bring animals to be sacrificed and other offerings to thank
Yahweh for what he has done for you.” And those who wanted to bring animals to be
completely burned on the altar brought them.
32 Altogether they brought 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 male lambs to be completely
burned on the altar.
33 The other animals that they brought were 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep and goats
that were set apart to be sacrifices.
34 But there were not enough priests to remove the skins from the animals that
would be completely burned on the altar. So their fellow descendants of Levi helped
them until that work was finished, and until other priests had purified/consecrated
themselves to do that work. It was necessary for them to do that because many of
the priests had not yet performed the rituals to consecrate themselves for that work,
like the descendants of Levi had done.
2 CHRONICLES 29:35
660
2 CHRONICLES 30:13
35 In addition to the all the offerings that were completely burned on the altar, the
priests also burned the fat of the other animals that were sacrificed to maintain good
fellowship with Yahweh, and the usual wine offerings.
So the worship at the temple began again.
36 And Hezekiah and all the other people of Judah celebrated, because God had
enabled them to do all those things very quickly.
30
Preparations to celebrate the Passover Festival
1-3 The king and his officials and all the other people who had gathered in Jerusalem
wanted to celebrate the Passover Festival. But they were not able to celebrate it at
the usual time, because many of the priests had still not performed the rituals to
purify themselves; therefore they were not allowed to do serve in the festival. Also,
everyone had still not come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover. So they decided
to celebrate it one month later than usual.
4 The king and all the other people who had gathered thought that was a good plan.
5 So they decided to send messages to all the towns in Judah and in Israel, from
Beersheba in the far south to Dan in the far north, including towns in the tribes
of Ephraim and Manasseh, to invite people to come to the temple in Jerusalem to
celebrate the Passover Festival to honor Yahweh, the God whom the Israeli people
worshiped/belonged to. Many of the people had not previously celebrated that festival,
6 Obeying what the king commanded, messengers went throughout Judah and
what they wrote:
return to Yahweh, the God whom our great ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
brothers did not faithfully obey Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors worshiped.
7 Do not act like they did, because what they did caused other people to become
disgusted with them.
8 Do not be stubborn as our ancestors were. Do what Yahweh desires. Come to
Jerusalem to the temple, which he has set apart forever. Do what pleases Yahweh our
God, in order that he will no longer be angry with you.
9 If you return to Yahweh, the people who have captured our brothers and sisters
and our children will be kind to them, and allow them to return to this land. Do not
forget that Yahweh our God is kind and merciful. If you return to him, he will no
longer reject you.”
10 The messengers went to all the towns in the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, as
far north as the tribe of Zebulun, and gave them this message, but most of the people
there scorned them and ridiculed them.
11 But some of the people of the tribes of Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled
themselves and went to Jerusalem.
12 Also in Judah God motivated the people to be united in wanting to do what
Yahweh wanted them to do, which is what the king and his officials had told them to
do in the message that they sent.
They celebrated the Passover Festival
13 So a huge crowd of people gathered in Jerusalem in May, to celebrate the Festival
of Eating Unleavened Bread.
2 CHRONICLES 30:14
2 CHRONICLES 31:1
14 They removed the altars of Baal in Jerusalem and took away the altars for burning
incense to honor other gods, and burned them in Kidron Valley.
15 They slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of that month. Some
of the priests and the other descendants of Levi were ashamed because they had not
performed the rituals to cause them to be acceptable to work for Yahweh. So they
performed those rituals, and brought to the temple animals to be completely burned
on the altar.
16 Then they stood at the places where Moses had written in his laws that they
should stand. Then the descendants of Levi gave to the priests bowls containing blood
of the animals that were being sacrificed, and the priests sprinkled the altar with some
of the blood.
17 Many people in the crowd had not purified themselves, and therefore they were
not able to kill the lambs and dedicate them to Yahweh. So it was necessary for the
descendants of Levi to kill the lambs for them.
18 Although most of the people who had come from the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh,
and Issachar had not purified themselves, they ate the food of the Passover Festival
anyway, ignoring the rules written by Moses. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying
19 who sincerely wants to honor you, the God whom our ancestors worshiped, even
20 And Yahweh heard what Hezekiah prayed; he forgave the people, and did not
21 The Israeli people who were there in Jerusalem celebrated the Festival of Eating
priests and other descendants of Levi sang to Yahweh every day, and played musical
instruments to praise God.
22 Hezekiah thanked all the descendants of Levi for doing this work for Yahweh,
and for very skillfully leading the people who were worshiping. For those seven
days the people ate the Passover food and brought offerings to maintain fellowship
with Yahweh and praised Yahweh, the God whom their ancestors belonged to/had
worshiped.
23 Then the whole group decided to celebrate for seven more days, so they did:
They celebrated joyfully for seven more days.
24 King Hezekiah provided 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep to be slaughtered for the
people to eat during the festival, and the officials also gave them 1,000 bulls and
10,000 sheep and goats. Many priests consecrated themselves.
25 All the people of Judah rejoiced, including the priests and other descendants of
Levi and all the people from Israel who had come, and including some from other
countries who were living in Israel and some from other countries who were living
in Judah.
26 Everyone in Jerusalem was very joyful, because nothing like this had happened
in Jerusalem since the time when David’s son Solomon was the king of Israel.
27 The priests and the other descendants of Levi stood up to bless the people, and
God heard them in heaven, the holy place where he lives.
31
1 After the festival ended, the Israelis who were there went to all the towns in
Judah and smashed the stones/pillars for worshiping idols, and cut down the poles
for worshiping the goddess Asherah. They destroyed the shrines on the hilltops and
the altars of Baal throughout the areas where the tribes of Judah and Benjamin lived,
2 CHRONICLES 31:2
662
2 CHRONICLES 31:15
and also in the areas of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. After destroying all of
them, they returned to their own towns.
The offerings for the priests and Levites
2 Hezekiah divided the priests and other descendants of Levi into groups.
He
appointed some of the groups to offer sacrifices that would be completely burned
on the altar and offerings to maintain fellowship with Yahweh. He appointed some
groups to do other work at the temple: some to lead the people in their worship,
some to thank Yahweh, and some to sing songs to praise to Yahweh at the gates of
3 The king contributed some of his own funds to buy animals that would be
celebrate the new moons, and during the other feasts, according to what was written
in the laws that Yahweh gave to Moses.
4 Hezekiah told the people living in Jerusalem to give to the priests and the other
descendants of Levi the portions of meat that should be given to them, in order that
they could devote all their time to obeying the laws of Yahweh.
5 As soon as he told that to the people, they generously gave the first part of their
harvest of grain, and the first part of the new wine that they produced, and olive oil
and honey, and of the crops that grew in their fields. They brought to the temple a
tenth of all their crops.
6 The men of Israel and Judah who were living in various towns in Judah also
brought a tenth of their cattle and sheep and goats, and a tenth of other things that
they had dedicated to Yahweh their God, and they piled all those things in heaps.
7 They started to do that in May and finished doing it in September.
8 When Hezekiah and his officials saw the heaps, they praised Yahweh and requested
God to bless the people.
9 But Hezekiah asked the priests and other descendants of Levi, “Why are these
heaps of things here?”
10 Then Azariah the Supreme Priest, a descendant of Zadok, replied, “Since the time
that the people started to bring their offerings to the temple, we have had even more
food than we need. This has happened because Yahweh has greatly blessed our fellow
Israelis, with the result that all this is left over after we priests and other descendants
of Levi took all that we need!”
11 Then Hezekiah ordered that they should prepare storerooms in the temple. So
they did that.
12 Then they brought into the storerooms all the tithes and offerings and the things
dedicated to Yahweh which the people had brought. One of the descendants of Levi
whose name was Conaniah was in charge of those things, and his younger brother
Shimei was his assistant.
13 Those two men supervised Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad,
Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath and Benaiah while they did the work. They were appointed
by King Hezekiah; Azariah was in charge of everything that was done in the temple.
14 Kore the son of Imnah, another descendant of Levi, who guarded the east gate
of the temple, was in charge of the offerings to God that were made voluntarily. He
distributed to the priests and other descendants of Levi the offerings and other things
that were dedicated to Yahweh.
15 Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah and Shecaniah faithfully assisted
him in the towns where the priests lived. They distributed those things to the groups
of their fellow priests; they distributed them to everyone, from the youngest to the
oldest.
2 CHRONICLES 31:16
663
2 CHRONICLES 32:9
16 They also distributed things to the males who were at least 30 years old, those
They were males who were allowed to enter the temple to perform their tasks/work
17 The names of the priests were on the scrolls where their clans’ names were
who were at least 20 years old.
whose names were on the scrolls where their clans’ names were written, because
they also faithfully had dedicated themselves to Yahweh.
19 Hezekiah also appointed other men to distribute portions of those offerings to the
priests and other descendants of Levi who were living in the pasturelands around the
towns in Judah. But they gave things only to those who were descendants of Aaron
the first Supreme Priest, whose names were on the scrolls containing the names of
their clans.
20 That is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah. He always faithfully did things that
Yahweh his God considered to be right and good.
21 In everything that he did for the worship in the temple, and as he obeyed God’s
laws and commands, he tried to find out what his God wanted, and he worked
energetically. So he was successful.
32
The army of King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded Judah
1 After King Hezekiah had obeyed Yahweh’s instructions and had done all those
things, King Sennacherib of Assyria came with his army and invaded Judah. He
commanded his soldiers to surround the cities that had walls around them, thinking
that they would break through those walls and conquer those cities.
2 When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come with his army and that they
intended to attack Jerusalem,
3-4 he consulted with his officials and army leaders. They said among themselves,
“Why should we allow the king of Assyria and his army to come and find plenty of
water to drink?” So they decided to stop the water from flowing outside the city. So
a large group of men gathered together and blocked all the springs and the stream
that flowed through that area.
5 Then they worked hard to repair all the sections of the city wall that had been
broken, and they built watchtowers on the walls. They built another wall outside/
around the wall that was already outside the city, and they strengthened the defenses
on the sloping terraces on the east side of the area called ‘The City of David’. They also
made a large number of weapons and shields.
6 Hezekiah appointed army commanders, and he gathered them in front of him in
the square at one of the city gates, and he encouraged them by saying this to them:
7 “Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged on account of the
king of Assyria and the huge army that is with him, because Yahweh is with us, and
his power is greater than their power.
8 They have to rely on the power of humans, but we have Yahweh our God to help
us and to fight battles for us.” So the people became more confident because of what
Hezekiah, the king of Judah, said.
9 Later, when Sennacherib and all his soldiers were surrounding Lachish city, he
sent some officers to Jerusalem to give this message to King Hezekiah and to all the
people of Judah who were there:
2 CHRONICLES 32:10
664
2 CHRONICLES 32:25
10 “I am Sennacherib, the great king of Assyria, and this is what I say: 'While you
are staying in Jerusalem, my soldiers are surrounding the city. So why [RHQ] are
you so confident?
11 Hezekiah says to you, “Yahweh our God will save us from being defeated by
having no food or water.
and altars on the hilltops, saying to you people of Jerusalem and other places in Judah,
“You must worship at only one altar and burn sacrifices on only that altar”?
13-14 'Do you people not know what I and my ancestors have done to all the peoplegroups in other countries? We destroyed them all, and none of the gods of those
nations were ever able to prevent my troops from conquering them! So how can
your god prevent my soldiers from conquering you?
15 So do not allow Hezekiah to deceive you like this. Do not believe what he says,
because no god of any nation or kingdom has ever been able to rescue his people
from being conquered by my army and the armies of my ancestors. So certainly your
god will not be able to rescue you from my power' .”
16 Sennacherib’s officers said more things to belittle Yahweh the God of the Israelis
and Hezekiah, who served God well.
17 King Sennacherib wrote more letters insulting Yahweh, the God whom the Israelis
belonged to/worshiped. He said things like this: “The gods worshiped by the peoplegroups in other countries did not rescue their people from my power. Similarly, the
god of Hezekiah will not rescue his people from my power.”
18 Then King Sennachereb’s officers shouted in the Hebrew language to the people
who were on the wall, in order to cause them to be terrified, thinking that as a result
the army of Assyria could capture the city without a battle.
19 They belittled the God worshiped by the people of Jerusalem as they belittled the
gods of the other people-groups of the world—saying that they were only idols made
by humans.
20 Then King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah cried out to God, praying about this.
21 And that night Yahweh sent an angel who killed all the soldiers of Assyria and
their leaders and their officers in the place where the king of Assyria and his army
had set up their tents. So the king of Assyria left and returned to his own country,
very disgraced. And one day when he went into the temple of his god, some of his
sons struck him with their swords and killed him.
22 That is how Yahweh rescued Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the
power of Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, and from their other enemies. Yahweh
took care of them (OR, gave them peace) everywhere in the country.
23 Many people brought offerings for Yahweh to Jerusalem, and also brought
valuable gifts for King Hezekiah. And from that time, Hezekiah was highly respected/
honored by the people of all the other nations.
Hezekiah became proud
24 About that time, Hezekiah became very ill. He was about to die. But he prayed
to Yahweh, and Yahweh answered his prayer. He performed a miracle and healed
Hezekiah.
25 But Hezekiah [SYN] was very proud, and he did not thank Yahweh for being kind
to him. Therefore Yahweh was angry with him and and punished him and the people
of Jerusalem and other places in Judah.

Hezekiah said that he was sorry for being proud, and the people of
Jerusalem also said that they were sorry for their sins. So Yahweh did not punish
them during the remaining years that Hezekiah was their king.
became very rich and was greatly honored. His workers made
and shields and other valuable things.
people produced and brought to him. They also made stalls for various kinds of cattle
29 They built towns and acquired for the king many flocks of sheep and goats and
herds of cattle, because God had enabled him to become very rich.
30 Hezekiah was the one who told his workers to block the place where the water
flows out of the Gihon Spring, and to build a tunnel through which the water flowed
to the west side of the area called ‘The City of David’. He was able to do everything
that he wanted to do.
31 But when messengers who were sent by the rulers of Babylon came and asked
about the miracle that God had performed for him, God allowed Hezekiah to say what
he himself wanted to say, in order to test whether or not Hezekiah would admit that
God had performed a miracle.
32 A record of the other things that happened while Hezekiah was ruling, and the
things that he did to please God, is on the scroll in which is written the vision that
Yahweh gave to the prophet Isaiah. It is also written in the scroll called ‘The History
of the Kings of Judah and Israel’.
33 When Hezekiah died, he was buried in the tombs where the most respected kings
of Judah were buried. Everyone in Jerusalem and other places in Judah honored him.
Then his son Manasseh became the king.
27 Hezekiah
King Manasseh of Judah
33
1 Manasseh was 12 years old when he became the king of Judah, and he ruled from
Jerusalem for 55 years.
2 He did many things that Yahweh considered to be evil. He imitated the disgusting
things that were formerly done by the people-groups that Yahweh had expelled from
Israel as his people advanced though the land.
3 He commanded his workers to rebuild the shrines for worshiping idols that his
father Hezekiah had destroyed. He told them to set up altars to honor the statues of
Baal, and to make altars to honor the goddess Asherah. He bowed down to worship
all the stars.
4 He directed his workers to build altars for foreign gods in the temple, about which
Yahweh had said, “It is here in Jerusalem that I want people to worship me, forever.”
5 He directed that altars for worshiping all the stars be built in both of the courtyards
outside the temple.
6 He even sacrificed some of his own sons and burned them in a fire in Hinnom
Valley. He performed rituals to practice sorcery. He asked fortune-tellers for advice.
He performed witchcraft. He talked to people who consulted the spirits of people
who had died to find out what would happen in the future. He did many things that
Yahweh considered o be very evil, things that caused Yahweh to become very angry.
7 Manasseh took a carved idol that his workers had made and put it in the temple.
That is the temple concerning which God had said to David and to his son Solomon,
2 CHRONICLES 33:8
666
2 CHRONICLES 33:24
“My temple will be here in Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen where I want people
to worship me, forever.
8 If they will obey all the laws and decrees and regulations that I told Moses to give
to them, I will not again force the Israeli people to leave this land that I gave to their
ancestors.”
9 But Manasseh led the people of Jerusalem and other places in Judah to do things
that are wrong, with the result that they did more evil than was done by the people in
the people-groups that Yahweh had expelled as the Israeli people advanced through
the land.
10 Yahweh spoke to Manasseh and the people of Judah, but they paid no attention.
11 So Yahweh caused the army commanders of Assyria and their soldiers to come to
Jerusalem, and they captured Manasseh. They put a hook in his nose and put bronze
chains on his feet and took him to Babylon.
12 There, while he was suffering, he humbled himself greatly in the presence of
Yahweh, the God whom his ancestors worshiped, and pleaded with Yahweh to help
him.
13 When he prayed, Yahweh heard him and pitied him. So he allowed him to return
to Jerusalem and to rule his kingdom again. Then Manasseh realized that Yahweh is
an all-powerful God.
14 Later, Manasseh’s workers rebuilt the eastern section of the outer wall around
Jerusalem, and they made it higher. That section extended from Gihon Spring north
to the Fish Gate, and around the part of the city that they called Ophel Hill. Manasseh
also appointed army officers to guard each of the cities in Judah that had walls around
them.
15 Manasseh’s workers removed from the temple the idols and the stone statues of
gods of other nations. Manasseh also told them to remove the altars that they had
previously built on Zion Hill and in other places in Jerusalem. He had all those things
thrown out of the city.
16 Then he told them to repair the altar of Yahweh, and he offered sacrifices to
restore fellowship with Yahweh and to thank him. And he told the people of Judah
that they must worship only Yahweh.
17 The people continued to offer sacrifices on the hilltops, but only to Yahweh their
God.
to God and the messages from Yahweh that the prophets gave to him, are written in
19 What Manasseh prayed and how God pitied him because he pleaded to God, and
built shrines and set up poles to honor the goddess Asherah and other idols before he
20 Manasseh died and was buried in his palace. Then his son Amon became the
king of Judah.
King Amon of Judah
21 Amon was 22 years old when he became king, and he ruled in Jerusalem for two
years.
22 He did things that Yahweh considered to be evil, like his father Manasseh had
done. Amon worshiped all the idols that Manasseh’s workers had made.
23 But he did not humble himself and turn to Yahweh like his father did. So he
became more sinful than his father had been.
24 Then Amon’s officials made plans to kill him. They assassinated him in his palace.
2 CHRONICLES 33:25
667
2 CHRONICLES 34:13
25 But then the people of Judah killed all those who had assassinated Amon, and
they appointed his son Josiah to be their king.
King Josiah of Judah
34
1 Josiah was eight years old when he became the king of Judah.
He ruled from
Jerusalem for 31 years.
2 He did things that were pleasing to Yahweh and conducted his life like his ancestor
King David had done. He fully obeyed [IDM] all the laws of God.
3 When he had been ruling for almost eight years, while he was still a young man,
he began to worship God like his ancestor King David had done. Four years later, he
began to get rid of all the pagan shrines on hilltops in Jerusalem and in other places in
Judah, and the poles to honor the goddess Asherah, and the carved idols and statues
of gods.
4 While he directed them, his workers tore down the altars where people worshiped
Baal. They smashed the altars that were near those altars, where people burned
incense. They smashed the poles tohonor the goddess Asherah and the idols and
statues. They smashed them to bits and scattered the bits over the graves of those
who had offered sacrifices to them.
5 They burned the bones of the priests who had offered sacrifices; they burned them
on their own altars. In that way Josiah caused Jerusalem and other places in Judah
to be acceptable places to worship Yahweh again.
6 In the towns in the tribes of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, and as far north as
the tribe of Naphtali and in the ruins around all those towns,
7 Josiah’s workers tore down the pagan altars and the poles to honor the goddess
Asherah, and crushed the idols to powder. They also smashed to pieces all the altars
for burning incense throughout Israel. Then Josiah returned to Jerusalem.
8 When Josiah had been ruling for almost 18 years, he did something else to cause
the land and the temple to be acceptable places to worship Yahweh. He sent Shaphan
the son of Azaliah and Maaseiah the governor of the city and Joah the son of Joahaz,
who wrote on a scroll what happened in the city, to repair the temple of Yahweh.
9 They went to Hilkiah the Supreme Priest and gave him the money that had been
brought to the temple. That was the money that the descendants of Levi who guarded
the doors of the temple had collected from the people of the tribes of Manasseh and
Ephraim and other places in northern Israel, and also from all the people in Jerusalem
and other places in the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.
10 Then Hilkiah gave some of the money to the men who had been appointed to
supervise the work of repairing the temple. The supervisors paid the men who did
the repair work.
11 They also gave some of the money to the carpenters and builders to buy the cut
stones and the timber for the joists and the beams for the buildings that the kings of
Judah had allowed to decay.
12 The workers did their work faithfully.
Their supervisors were Jahath and
Obadiah, who were descendants of Levi’s son Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam,
who were descendants of Levi’s son Kohath. All the other descendants of Levi, those
who played musical instruments well,
of Levi were secretaries and some kept records and some guarded the gates of the
The scroll containing God’s laws was found
2 CHRONICLES 34:14
668
2 CHRONICLES 34:31
14 While they were giving to the supervisors the money that had been taken to the
temple, Hilkiah the Supreme Priest found a scroll on which were written the laws that
Yahweh had told Moses to give to the people.
15 So Hilkiah said to Shaphan, “I have found in the temple a scroll on which are
written the laws that God gave to Moses!” Then Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan.
16 Shaphan took the scroll to the king and said to him, “Your officials are doing
everything that you told them to do.
17 They have taken the money that was in the temple, and they have given it to the
men who will supervise the workers who will repair the temple.”
18 Then Shaphan said to the king, “I have brought to you a scroll that Hilkiah gave
to me.” And Shaphan started to read it to the king.
19 When the king heard the laws that were written in the scroll, he tore his clothes
because he was very dismayed/worried.
20 Then he gave these instructions to Hilkiah, to Shaphan’s son Ahikam, to Micah’s
son Abdon, to Shaphan, and to Asaiah the king’s special advisor:
21 “Go and ask Yahweh for me, and for all his people who are still alive in Judah
and Israel, about what is written in this scroll that has been found. Because it is clear
that Yahweh is very angry with us because our ancestors disobeyed what Yahweh
said; they did not obey the laws that are written on this scroll.”
22 So Hilkiah and the others went to talk with a woman whose name was Huldah,
who was a prophetess who lived in the newer part of Jerusalem. Her husband
Shallum who was the son of Tikvah, took care of the robes that were worn in the
temple.
23 When they told her what the king had said, she said to them, “This is what Yahweh,
24 that this is what Yahweh says: “Listen to this carefully. I am going to cause a
experience the curses that were written in the scroll that was read to the king of
Judah.
25 I will do that because they have rejected me, and they burn incense to honor
other gods. They have caused me to become very angry because of all the idols that
they have made (OR, because of all the wicked things that they have done), and my
anger is like a fire that will not be extinguished.
26 The king of Judah sent you to ask what I, Yahweh, want. Go and tell him that this
is what I, Yahweh, the God whom you Israelis worship, say about what you read:
when you heard what I said to warn about what would happen to this city and the
people who live here, and because you tore your robes and wept in my presence, I
have heard you.
28 So I will allow you to die and be buried peacefully. I will cause a great disaster to
strike this place and the people who live here, but you will not be alive to see it.” ’ ”
So they reported her reply to the king.
29 Then the king summoned all the elders of Jerusalem and other places in Judea.
30 They went up together to the temple with the leaders of Judah and many other
people of Jerusalem and the priests and other descendants of Levi, from the least
important to the most important ones. And while they listened, the king read to
them everything that was in the scroll containing God’s laws that had been found in
the temple.
31 Then the king stood next to the pillar at the entrance to the temple, where kings
stood when they announced something important, and while Yahweh was listening,
2 CHRONICLES 34:32
669
2 CHRONICLES 35:12
commands and regulations and decrees that were written on the scroll.
Benjamin should promise that they also would obey those laws. And they did that,
worshiped, had made with them.
33 Josiah instructed his workers to remove all the detestable idols from everywhere
in the land of the Israeli people, and he commanded that all the people from Israel
alive, the people did what was pleasing to Yahweh, the God whom their ancestors
worshiped.
35
Josiah led them in celebrating the Passover Festival
1 Josiah commanded that the people should celebrate the Passover Festival to honor
Yahweh in Jerusalem. So they slaughtered the lambs for the Passover Festival at the
end of March.
2 Josiah assigned to the priests the tasks that they should perform at the temple and
encouraged them to do their work well.
3 The other descendants of Levi were the ones who taught all the Israeli people;
they had been dedicated to serve Yahweh. Josiah said to them, “Put the Sacred Chest
in the temple that the workers of David’s son King Solomon of Israel built. But carry it
on poles; do not carry it on your shoulders. And do your your work well for Yahweh
your God and for his Israeli people.
4 Divide yourselves into clans, obeying the instructions that King David and his son
Solomon wrote.
5 Then stand in the temple, with one group of the descendants of Levi to help each
clan of the people when they bring their offerings to the temple.
yourselves to be acceptable to Yahweh for doing this work. Prepare the sacrifices,
doing what Yahweh told Moses to tell you that you should do.”
7 Josiah provided from his own flocks and herds 30,000 sheep and goats for the
Passover sacrifices.
8 His officials also voluntarily contributed animals for the people and the priests
and the other descendants of Levi. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the officials who
were in charge of the temple, gave to the priests 2,600 lambs and 300 cattle to be
sacrifices for the Passover.
9 And Conaniah along with his younger brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, and
Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the leaders of the other descendants of Levi, provided
5,000 lambs and 500 cattle for the other descendants of Levi, to be sacrifices for the
Passover.
10 Everything for the Passover was arranged: The priests and the other descendants
of Levi stood in their places in their groups, like the king had commanded.
11 Then they slaughtered the Passover lambs. The priests sprinkled the blood from
the bowls that were handed to them, while the other descendants of Levi removed
the skins from the animals.
12 They set aside the animals to be completely burned on the altar, in order to give
them to the various family groups to offer to Yahweh, obeying the instructions that
were written in the laws God gave Moses. They did the same thing with the cattle.
2 CHRONICLES 35:13
670
2 CHRONICLES 35:26-27
13 Obeying those regulations, they roasted the lambs for the Passover over the fire.
And they boiled the meat of the sacred offerings in pots and kettles and pans, and
served the meat immediately to all the people who were there.
14 After that, they prepared meat for themselves and for the priests, because the
priests were busy until nighttime, sacrificing the offerings to be completely burned
and burning the fat parts of the offerings. So the other descendants of Levi prepared
meat for themselves and for the priests, who were descendants of Aaron, the first
Supreme Priest.
15 The musicians, who were descendants of Asaph, stood in their places, as King
David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s prophet had commanded. The men
who guarded the gates of the temple did not need to leave their places, because their
fellow descendants of Levi prepared food for them to eat.
16 So on that day everything that needed to done for worshiping Yahweh was done.
They celebrated the Passover Festival, and they presented offerings to be completely
burned on the altar, which was what Josiah had commanded.
17 The Israelis who were there celebrated the Passover Festival on that day, and for
seven days they celebrated the Festival of Eating Unleavened Bread.
18 The Passover Festival had not been celebrated like that in Israel since the time
that the prophet Samuel lived. None of the other kings of Israel had ever celebrated
the Passover like Josiah did, along with the priests, the other descendants of Levi, and
all the other people of Judah and Israel who were there with the people who lived in
Jerusalem.
19 They celebrated this Passover Festival when Josiah had been ruling for almost 18
years.
The end of Josiah’s life
20 After Josiah had done all those things to restore the worship at the temple, King
Neco of Egypt went with his army to attack Carchemish city alongside the Euphrates
River, and Josiah marched with his army to fight against them.
21 Neco sent some messengers to Josiah, to tell him, “You are the king of Judah,
and there is certainly no quarrel between you and me. My army is not attacking you
people; we are attacking another army, the army of Babylonia. God has told me to
hurry. So stop opposing God, who is for me. If you do not stop, God will get rid of
you.”
22 But Josiah would not pay attention to him. Instead, he disguised himself in order
to be able to attack the army of Egypt without anyone recognizing him. He did not
pay any attention to what God had told Neco to say. Instead, he and his army went to
fight Neco’s army at the plain of Megiddo.
23 Some Egyptian archers shot King Josiah. He told his officers, “Take me away from
here because I am badly wounded.”
24 So they took him out of his chariot and put him in another chariot that he had
brought with him, and they took him to Jerusalem, where he died. He was buried in
the tombs where his ancestors had been buried, and all the people of Jerusalem and
other places in Judah mourned for him.
25 The prophet Jeremiah composed a song to mourn for Josiah, and all the men and
custom in Israel; the words of that song are written in a scroll of funeral songs.
he started to rule until he died, including how he faithfully honored God by obeying
of the Kings of Israel and Judah’.

King Jehoahaz of Judah
1 Then the people of Judah chose Josiah’s son Jehoahaz and appointed him as the
king in Jerusalem.
2 Jehoahaz was 23 years old when he became the king, but he ruled from Jerusalem
for only three months.
3 King Neco of Egypt captured him and prevented him from ruling any longer. He
also forced the people of Judah to pay him a tax of almost four tons of silver and
about 75 pounds of gold.
4 The king of Egypt appointed Jehoahaz’s younger brother Eliakim to be the king of
Judah. He changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. After Neco captured Jehoahaz, he
took him to Egypt.
King Jehoiakim of Judah
5 Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became the king of Judah, and he ruled from
Jerusalem for 11 years. He did things that Yahweh his God considers to be evil.
6 Then the army of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked Jehoiakim’s army.
They captured Jehoiakim and bound him with bronze chains and took him to Babylon.
7 Nebuchadnezzar’s soldiers also took valuable things from the temple; they took
them to Babylon and put them in king Nebuchadnezzar’s palace there.
8 A record of the other things that happened while Jehoiakim was ruling, the
detestable things that he did, including the evil things that people said that he did,
is written in the scroll called ‘The History of the Kings of Israel and Judah’. After he
was taken to Babylon, his son Jehoiachin became the king of Judah.
King Jehoiachin of Judah
9 Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became the king of Judah, and he ruled from
Jerusalem for only three months and ten days. He did things that Yahweh considers
to be evil.
10 During the spring of the next year, King Nebuchadnezzar sent soldiers to bring
him to Babylon. They also took to Babylon many valuable things from the temple
of Yahweh. Then Nebuchadnezzar appointed Jehoiachin’s uncle, Zedekiah, to be the
king of Judah.
King Zedekiah of Judah
11 Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became the king, and he ruled in Jerusalem
for 11 years.
12 He did many things that Yahweh his God considered to be evil. And he did not
humble himself when the prophet Jeremiah gave him a message from Yahweh to
warn him.
13 He would not return to Yahweh, the God that the people of Israel said that they
worshiped. Zedekiah also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had forced
stubborn.
more wicked again, doing all the detestable things that the people of the other nations
did, and causing the temple in Jerusalem that Yahweh had caused to be holy to become
an unacceptable place to worship him.
Jerusalem was ruined
15 Yahweh, the God whom the ancestors of the people of Judah belonged to/worshiped,
gave messages to his prophets many times, and the prophets told those messages to
2 CHRONICLES 36:16
672
2 CHRONICLES 36:23
the people of Judah. Yahweh did that because he pitied his people and did not want
his temple to be destroyed.
16 But the people continually made fun of God’s messengers. They despised God’s
messages. They ridiculed his prophets, until finally God became extremely angry
with his people, with the result that nothing could stop him from destroying Judah.
17 He incited the king of Babylonia to attack Judah with his army. They killed the
young men with their swords, even in the temple. They did not spare/pity anyone,
young men or young women or old people. God enabled the army of Nebuchadnezzar
to kill all of them.
18 His soldiers took to Babylon all the things that were used in God’s temple—big
things and little things, all the valuable things, and the valuable things that belonged
to the king and his officials.
19 They burned the temple, and they broke down the wall surrounding Jerusalem.
They burned all the palaces in Jerusalem and destroyed all the remaining valuable
things there.
20 Nebuchadnezzar’s soldiers took to Babylon the remaining people who had not
been killed with their swords. Then those people became the king’s slaves and his
son’s slaves, until the army of the king of Persia conquered the army of Babylonia.
21 Moses had said that every seventh year the people must not plant their fields; they
must allow the soil to rest. But the people had not done that. So after the army of
Babylonia destroyed Judah, the soil was allowed to rest. That continued for 70 years,
fulfilling what Yahweh told Jeremiah and what Jeremiah had predicted/prophesied
would happen.
22 During the first year that Cyrus was the king of Persia, in order that what Yahweh
told Jeremiah would happen would occur, Yahweh motivated Cyrus to write this and
proclaim it throughout his kingdom:
23 “I, Cyrus, the king of Persia, declare that Yahweh, the God who rules in heaven,
has enabled me to become the ruler of all the kingdoms of this world. And he
wants me to command that my workers build a temple {a temple be built} for him
in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Any of his people living among you people of Persia
are allowed to go to Jerusalem. And I will pray that Yahweh will be with them.”
Ezra 1:1
673
Judah returning to Judah and rebuilding the temple. We
Ezra
Cyrus let the Jews return to Jerusalem
1 During the first year that Cyrus ruled the Persian Empire,
he did something
that fulfilled what Jeremiah had prophesied. Yahweh motivated Cyrus to write this
message, and then Cyrus sent this message throughout his empire:
2 “I, King Cyrus, who rule the Persian Empire, declare this: 'Yahweh, the God who
is in/rules from heaven, has caused me to become the ruler of all the kingdoms that
I know about on the earth. And he has appointed me to enable his people to build
a temple for him in Jerusalem, in Judah land.
3 All you people who belong to God may go up to Jerusalem to rebuild this temple
for Yahweh, the God who lives in Jerusalem, the God who is worshiped by you Israeli
people. I desire/hope that your God will be with you and help those who go there.
4 Those people who are in places where Israelis are living, whose ancestors were
exiled here, should contribute silver and gold to those who go. They should also
give them supplies that they will need for the journey to Jerusalem. They should also
give them some livestock, and gifts of money to help build the temple of God in
Jerusalem.' ”
5 Then God motivated some of the priests and ◄Levites/men who did work in the
temple► and some of the leaders of the tribes that were descended from Judah and
Benjamin to return to Jerusalem. Those whom God motivated got ready to return to
Jerusalem and build the temple for Yahweh there.
6 All of their neighbors helped them by giving them things made of silver and things
made of gold, and supplies for the journey, and livestock. They also gave them other
valuable gifts, and also gave them money to buy things for building the temple.
7 King Cyrus brought out the valuable things that King Nebuchadnezzar’s soldiers
had taken from the temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem and put in the temple of
Nebuchadnezzar’s gods in Babylon.
8 Cyrus commanded Mithredath, the treasurer of the Persian Empire, to count all
these items and then give them to Sheshbazzar, the leader of the group that was going
9 This is a list of the items that Cyrus donated:
1,000 large silver dishes
10 30 gold bowls
410 silver bowls
1,000 other items.
11 All together, there were 5,400 items made of silver or gold, that were given to
Sheshbazzar to take with him when he and the others returned to Jerusalem.

those men were Israelis, they would be permitted to eat the shares of the sacrifices
64 Altogether 42,360 Israeli people who returned to Judah.
Ezra 2:65
676
Ezra 3:9
65 There were also 7,337 servants and 200 musicians, both men and women, who
returned.
66 The Israelis brought with them from Babylonia 736 horses, 245 mules,
67 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.
68 When they arrived at the temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem, some of the clan leaders
gave money for the supplies needed to rebuild the temple at the place where the
temple had been previously.
69 They all gave as much money as they were able to give. Altogether they gave
61,000 gold coins, ◄6,250 pounds/3,000 kg.► of silver, and 100 robes for the priests.
70 Then the priests, the other descendants of Levi, the musicians, the temple guards,
and some of the other people started to live in the towns and villages near Jerusalem.
The rest of the people went to the other places in Israel where their ancestors had
lived.

They rebuilt the altar in Jerusalem
1 After the Israeli people returned to Israel, and had begun to live in their towns,
◄in the autumn of/after the hot season ended in► that year, they all gathered together
in Jerusalem.
2 Then Jeshua, the son of Jehozadak, and his fellow priests, and Zerubbabel the
son of Shealtiel and his friends, all began to rebuild the altar of God, the one whom
the Israeli people worshiped. They did that in order that they could sacrifice burned
offerings on it, according to what the prophet Moses had written in the laws that God
gave to him.
3-6 Even though they were afraid of the people who were already living in that area,
they rebuilt the altar at the same place where the previous altar had been. Before
they started to lay the foundation of Yahweh’s temple, the priests started to burn
sacrifices to Yahweh on the altar. They offered sacrifices every morning and every
evening. Fifteen days after they started to offer these sacrifices, the people celebrated
the Festival of Living in Temporary Shelters, as Moses had commanded them to do in
the laws that God gave to him. Each day the priests offered the sacrifices that were
required for that day. In addition, they presented the regular burned offerings and
the offerings that were required for the New Moon Festivals and the other festivals
that they celebrated each year to honor Yahweh. They also brought other offerings
only because they desired to bring them, not because they were required to bring them.
They rebuilt the temple
7 Then the Israelis hired masons and carpenters, and they bought logs from cedar
trees from the people of Tyre and Sidon cities, and they gave those people food and
wine and olive oil for the logs. They brought the logs down from the mountains in
Lebanon to the Mediterranean seacoast and then floated them along the coast of the
Sea, to Joppa. King Cyrus permitted them to do that. Then the logs were brought from
Joppa inland up to Jerusalem.
8 The Israelis started to rebuild the temple in the ◄spring/time before the hot
season► of the second year after they returned to Jerusalem. Zerubbabel and Jeshua
and all the people who had returned to Jerusalem worked on the building. All the
◄Levites/men who did work in the temple► supervised this work.
9 Jeshua and his sons and his other relatives, and Kadmiel and his sons, who were
descendants of Hodaviah, also helped to supervise the work. The family of Henadad,
who were also all Levites, joined with them in supervising this work.
Ezra 3:10
677
Ezra 4:9
10 When the builders finished laying the foundation of the temple, the priests put
on their robes and stood in their places, blowing their trumpets. Then the Levites,
who were descendants of Asaph, clashed/banged their cymbals to praise Yahweh, just
as King David had many years previously told Asaph and the other musicians to do.
11 They praised Yahweh and thanked him, and they sang this song about him:
“He is very good to us!
He faithfully loves us Israeli people, and he will love us forever.”
Then all the people shouted loudly, praising Yahweh because they had finished laying
the foundation of Yahweh’s temple.
temple was like, and they cried aloud when they saw the foundation of this temple
being laid because they knew that the new temple would not be as beautiful as the first
temple. But the other people shouted joyfully.
13 The shouting and the crying was very loud; even people far away could hear it.

Their enemies opposed rebuilding the temple
1 The enemies of the people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin heard that the Israeli
people who had returned from Babylonia were rebuilding a temple for Yahweh, the
God whom the Israeli people worshiped.
2 So they went to Zerubbabel the governor and the other leaders, and said
deceptively, “We want to help you build the temple, because we worship that same God
whom you worship, and we have been offering sacrifices to him since Esarhaddon,
the King of Assyria, brought us here.”
3 But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other Israeli leaders replied, “We will not allow
you to help us build a temple for our(exc) God. We will build it ◄ourselves/without
your help► for Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship, like Cyrus, the King of
Persia, told us to do.”
4 Then the people who had been living in that land before the Israelis returned tried
to cause the Jews to become discouraged and become afraid, and to cause them to
stop building the temple.
5 They bribed government officials to oppose what the Israelis were doing and
prevent them from continuing to work on the temple. They did that all during the
time that Cyrus was King of Persia. They continued to do it when Darius became the
Opposition to rebuilding Jerusalem
6 During the first year that Darius’ son Xerxes was king, the enemies of the Jews
wrote a note to the king saying that the Jews were planning to rebel against the
government.
7 Later, when Xerxes’ son Artaxerxes became the King of Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath,
Tabeel and their colleagues/companions wrote a letter to him. They wrote the letter
in the Aramaic language, and it was translated into another language that the king
knew.
8 Rehum, the high commissioner, and Shimshai, the provincial secretary, wrote the
letter to King Artaxerxes concerning what was happening in Jerusalem.
9 They stated that the letter was from Rehum the high commissioner/governor and
Shimshai the provincial secretary and from their associates, the judges, and other
government officials, who were from Erech city, Babylon city, and Susa city in Elam
district.
Ezra 4:10
678
Ezra 4:24
10 They also wrote that they represented the other people-groups whom the army
of the great and glorious/famous King Ashurbanipal had ◄deported/forced to move
from their homes► and taken to live in Samaria and in other cities in the province
west of the Euphrates River.
11 This is what they wrote in the letter:
“To King Artaxerxes,
From the officials who serve you who live in the province west of the Euphrates
River.
12 “Your majesty, we want you to know that the Jews who came here from your
territories are rebuilding this city, Jerusalem. These people are wicked and want
to rebel against you. Now they are repairing the foundations of the walls/buildings
and building the walls of the city.
13 “It is important for you to know that if they rebuild the city and finish building
the walls, they will stop paying any kind of taxes. As a result, there will be less
money in your treasury.
be humiliated [IDM], we are sending this information to you.
15 And, we suggest that you order/tell your officials to search the records that
your ancestors made/wrote. If you do that, you will find out that the people in this
city have always rebelled against the government. You will also find out that from
long ago these people have caused trouble for kings and for rulers of provinces. They
have always revolted against those who ruled them. That is the reason that this city
was destroyed by the Babylonian army.
16 We want you to know that if they rebuild this city and finish building its walls,
you will no longer be able to control/rule the people in this province west of the
Euphrates River.”
17 After the king read this letter, he sent this reply to them:
“To Rehum, the high commissioner, and Shimshai, the provincial secretary, and
their colleagues in Samaria and in other parts of the province that is west of the

true that the people of that city have always revolted against their rulers, and that
the city is full of people who have rebelled and caused trouble.
20 Powerful kings have ruled in Jerusalem, and they have also ruled over the
whole province west of the Euphrates River. The people in that province were paying
all kinds of taxes to those kings.
21 So you must command that the people must stop rebuilding the city. Only if I
tell them that they may rebuild it will they be allowed to continue.
22 Do this immediately [LIT], because I do not want those people to do anything
to harm the things/area about which I am concerned.”
23 Messengers took that letter to Rehum and Shimshai and their colleagues and read
it to them. Then Rehum and the others went quickly to Jerusalem, and they forced
the Jews to stop rebuilding the city wall.
24 The result was that the Jews stopped rebuilding the temple. They did not do any
more work to rebuild the temple until Darius became the King of Persia.

Tattenai’s letter to King Darius
1 At that time two prophets gave messages from God to the Jews in Jerusalem and
other cities in Judah. The prophets were Haggai and Zechariah, who was a descendant
of Iddo. They spoke those messages representing God, whom the Israelis worshiped/
belonged to, the one who was their true king.
2 Then Zerubbabel and Shealtiel led many other people as they started again to
rebuild the temple of God in Jerusalem. And God’s prophets Haggai and Zechariah
were with them and helped them.
3 Then Tattenai the governor of the province west of the Euphrates River and
Shethar-Bozenai his assistant and some of their officials went to Jerusalem and said
to the people, “Who has permitted you to rebuild this temple and put furnishings in
it?”
4 They also requested the people to tell them the names of the men who were
working at the temple. But the people refused.
5 However, God was taking care of the Jewish leaders, so their enemies were not
able to prevent the people from continuing to rebuild the temple. They continued to
work while their enemies sent a report to King Darius, and asked him what he wanted
them to do about it.
6 So Tattenai and Shethar-Bozenai and their officials sent a report to King Darius.
7 This is what they wrote:
“King Darius, we hope that things are going well for you!
8 “We want you to know that we went to Judah Province, where the temple of the
great God is being rebuilt. The people are building it with huge stones, and they
are putting wooden beams in the walls. The work is being done very carefully, and
they are progressing well.
9 “We asked the Jewish leaders, ‘Who has permitted you to rebuild this temple
10 And we requested them to tell us the names of their leaders, in order that we
11 “But instead of telling us their leaders’ names, what they said was, ‘We serve
ruled us Israeli people told our ancestors to build a temple here, and now we are
12 “'But God, who rules in heaven, allowed the armies of Nebuchadnezzar, King
of Babylonia, to destroy that temple, because our ancestors did things that caused
God to become very angry. Nebuchadnezzar’s army took many of the Israeli people
to Babylonia.
13 “'However, during the first year that Cyrus the King of Babylon started to rule,
he decreed that the temple of God should be rebuilt.
14 Cyrus returned to the Jewish leaders all the gold and silver cups that had been
taken from the temple in Jerusalem and which had been put in the temple in Babylon.
Those cups were given to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom King Cyrus had appointed
to be the governor in Judah.
15 “'The king instructed him to take the cups back to Jerusalem, to the place from
which they had previously been taken. He also decreed that they should rebuild the
temple at the place where it had been before. So Cyrus appointed Sheshbazzar to
Ezra 5:16
680
Ezra 6:9
be the governor in Judah. He also sent all those things made of gold and silver, for
Sheshbazzar to put in the new temple.
16 So Sheshbazzar did that. He came here to Jerusalem, and supervised the men
who laid the foundation of the temple. And since that time, the people have been
working on the temple, but it is not finished yet.’
your majesty, please order someone to search in the place in
Babylon where the important records are kept, to find out whether it is true that
King Cyrus decreed that God’s temple should be rebuilt in Jerusalem. Then you can
tell us what you want us to do about this matter.”
17 “Therefore,

What King Darius commanded
1 Later Darius became the ruler of the Persian Empire.
When the enemies of the
Israelis forced them to stop rebuilding the temple, the Persian officials sent a message
to King Darius. They asked him to search the records in the ◄archives/government
records►, in the building where the king stored the important documents, to find out
whether King Cyrus had authorized that the temple should be rebuilt.
2 The king commanded someone to search there, but those documents were not there
in Babylon. They found a scroll at the fort in Ecbatana, in Media province, that
contained the information that they wanted to know.
This is what was written on that scroll:
3 “During the first year that Cyrus ruled the empire, he sent out a decree
concerning the temple of God which is at Jerusalem. In the decree it was stated
had offered sacrifices, where the original foundation of the first temple was. The
4 The building must be made from large stones. After putting down three layers
of stones, a layer of timber must be put on top of them. This work will be paid for
by money from my treasury.
5 Also, the gold and silver utensils that King Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple
of God in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon must be taken back to Jerusalem. They
must be put in God’s temple just as they were in the previous temple.”
6 After reading this,
King Darius sent this message to the leaders of the Israeli
people’s enemies in Jerusalem:
“This is a message for Tattenai, the governor of the province west of the Euphrates
River, and for his assistant Shethar-Bozenai, and for all your colleagues: Stay away
from that area!
7 Do not ◄interfere with/hinder► the work of building the temple of God! The
temple must be rebuilt at the same place where the former temple was. And do not
hinder the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews while they are doing this
work.
8 “Furthermore, I declare that you must help these leaders of the Jews as they
rebuild this temple of God by giving them funds for the building work.
9 “The Jewish priests in Jerusalem need young bulls and rams and lambs to
sacrifice as they make burned offerings to the God of heaven. You must give them
the animals that they need. Also, you must be certain to give them the wheat, salt,
wine, and olive oil that they need each day for those sacrifices.
Ezra 6:10
681
Ezra 7:2
10 If you do that, the Jewish priests will be able to offer sacrifices that please the
God who is in heaven, and they will pray that God will bless me and my sons.
11 “If anyone disobeys this decree, my soldiers will pull a beam from his house.
Then after they sharpen one end of the beam, they will lift that man up and impale
him on that beam. Then they will completely destroy that man’s house until only a
pile of rubble is left.
12 God has chosen that city of Jerusalem as the place where people will honor
him [MTY]. What I desire is that he will get rid of any king or any nation that tries to
change this decree or tries to destroy that temple in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have made
this decree. It must be obeyed quickly and thoroughly.”
They completed and dedicated the temple
13 Tattenai, the governor of the province, and his assistant Shethar-Bozenai and
their colleagues read the message and immediately obeyed the decree of King Darius.
14 So the Jewish leaders continued their work of rebuilding the temple.
They
were greatly encouraged by the messages that the prophets Haggai and Zechariah
preached. The Israelis continued building the temple, just like God had commanded
them to do and like King Cyrus had decreed.
15 They finished building it on March 12, during the sixth year that King Darius
16 Then the priests and the Levites and all the other Israeli people who had returned
17 During the ceremony to dedicate the temple, they sacrificed 100 young bulls, 200
that God would forgive the sins of the people of the twelve tribes of Israel.
18 Then the priests and Levites were divided into groups that would take turns to
serve at the temple. They did this according to what Moses had written many years
previously in the laws that he wrote.
They celebrated the Passover Festival
19 On April 21, the Jews who had returned from Babylon celebrated the Passover
Festival.
20 To qualify themselves for offering the sacrifices, the priests and Levites had already
purified themselves by performing certain rituals. Then they slaughtered the lambs
for the benefit of all the people who had returned from Babylon, for the other priests,
and for themselves.
21 Those who had returned from Babylon and the other people in that land who
had turned away from their immoral practices in order to worship Yahweh, the God
of the Israeli people, ate the Passover meal.
22 They celebrated the Unleavened Bread Festival of Eating Unleavened Bread for
seven days. The Israeli people throughout the land were joyful because Yahweh had
changed the attitude of the king of Assyria toward them, and as a result, the king had
helped them to rebuild the temple of God, the one whom they worshiped.

Ezra went to Jerusalem
1 Many/Fifty years later, while Artaxerxes was the king of Persia, I, Ezra came from
Babylon here to Jerusalem. I am the son of Seraiah and the grandson of Azariah, and
2 Hilkiah was the son of Shallum, who was the son of Zadok, who was the son of
Ahitub,

5 who was the son of Abishua, who was the son of Phinehas, who was the son of
Eleazar, who was the son of Aaron, the first Supreme Priest.
6 I am a man who knows very well the laws that Moses wrote. Those were the laws
that Yahweh, the God whom we Israeli people ◄worship/belong to►, had given to us
Israeli people. When I arrived in Jerusalem, Yahweh my God was kind to me, and as
a result the people gave me everything that I had requested the king to tell them to
give to me.
7 Some of the priests, some other descendants of Levi, some singers, some
in the temple, and some other Israeli people came up with me here to Jerusalem. That
8-9 We left Babylon on April 8, which was the first day of the Jewish year. Because
10 During my entire life, I devoted myself to studying the laws of Yahweh, and how
to obey those laws. I had also taught those laws and all their regulations to the Israeli
people for many years.
The letter that Artaxerxes gave to Ezra
11 King Artaxerxes knew that I am a priest who knows the Jewish laws very well.
He knew that for many years I had studied those laws and had taught all the rules
and regulations of those laws to the Israeli people. So before I left Babylon to come to
Jerusalem, he wrote a letter, and gave a copy to me. This is what he wrote:
12 “This letter is from me, Artaxerxes, the greatest of the kings. I am giving it to
Ezra the priest, who has studied very well all the rules and regulations that the God
who is/rules in heaven gave to the Israeli people.
13 “Ezra, I command that when you return to Jerusalem, any of the Israeli people
in my kingdom who want to are allowed to go with you. That includes any priests
and other descendants of Levi who will work in the temple who want to go.
14 I, along with my seven counselors/advisors, am sending you to Jerusalem, in
order that you can determine what is happening there and in other towns in Judah.
You are taking with you [MTY] a copy of God’s laws; make sure that the people are
doing everything that is written in those laws.
15 We are also saying that you should take with you the silver and gold that I and
my advisors are wanting to give to you, in order that you will present it to be an
offering to the God who rules the Israeli people and who lives in Jerusalem.
16 You should also take any silver and gold that the people in the entire Babylonia
province give to you, and the money that the priests and other Israeli people have
happily said that they would give to you to be offerings for building the temple of
their God in Jerusalem.
17 With this money, you should buy the bulls, rams, lambs, and the grain and wine
that the priests will burn on the altar outside the temple of your God in Jerusalem.
18 “If there is any silver or gold that remains you have bought all those things,
you and your companions/colleagues are permitted to use it to buy whatever you
desire, but buy only things that you know that God wants you to buy.
19 We have given to you some valuable items to be used in the temple of your
God. Take them also to Jerusalem.
Ezra 7:20
683
Ezra 8:9
20 If you need any other things for the temple, you are permitted to get the money
for those things from the building here where my government’s money is kept/stored.
21 “And I, King Artaxerxes, command this to all the treasurers in the province
west of the Euphrates River: 'Give to Ezra, the priest who has studied very well the
laws of the God who is/rules in heaven, everything that he requests, and give it to
him quickly.
22 The most that you should give to him is ◄7,500 pounds/3,400 kg.► of silver, 500
bushels of wheat, 550 gallons of wine, and 550 gallons of olive oil, but give to him all
the salt that they need.
we certainly do not [RHQ] want him to be angry with me or with my descendants
24 We are also commanding that none of the priests, descendants of Levi,
to pay any kind of taxes.'
25 “Ezra, your God has enabled you to become very wise. Using that wisdom,
appoint men in the province west of the Euphrates River who will judge cases
involving the people, and men who will judge cases involving the government. You
must appoint men who know the laws of your God. All of you must teach God’s
laws to others who do not know them.
26 Everyone who does not obey God’s laws or the laws of my government must be
punished severely. Some of them will be executed, some will be put in prison, some
will be sent out of the country or have all their property taken away from them.”
Ezra praised Yahweh
27 Because King Artaxerxes was very kind like that, I said, “Praise Yahweh, the God
whom our ancestors worshiped/belonged to! He has caused the king to want to honor
the temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem.
powerful officials have also been kind to me. So, because God has helped me, I have
go up to Jerusalem with me.”

The clans that returned with Ezra to Jerusalem
1 This is a list of the names of the leaders of the clans who came with me up to
Jerusalem from Babylonia when Artaxerxes was the king of Persia:
2 Gershom, from the clan descended from Aaron’s grandson Phinehas
Daniel, from the clan descended from Aaron’s son Ithamar
Hattush, the son of Shecaniah, from the clan descended from King David
3 Zechariah and 150 other men from the clan descended from Parosh
4 Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah and 200 other men from the clan descended from
Pahath-Moab
5 Shecaniah the son of Jahaziel and 300 other men from the clan descended from
Zattu
6 Ebed the son of Jonathan and 50 other men from the clan descended from Adin
7 Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah and 70 other men from the clan descended from Elam

another man whose name was Bebai
12 Johanan the son of Hakkatan and 110 other men from the clan descended from
Azgad
13 Also Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah, who returned here later with 60 men from
the clan descended from Adonikam
14 And Uthai and Zaccur and 70 other men from the clan descended from Bigvai.
Ezra and the others prepared to return to Jerusalem
15 I gathered all of them together at the canal that goes from Babylon to Ahava town.
We set up our tents there and stayed there for three days. During that time I checked
the lists of names and found out that there were priests going with us, but no other
descendants of Levi who could help them in the temple.
16 So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, two men whose names were Elnathan,
and Jarib, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were all leaders of the people. I
also summoned Joiarib and another Elnathan, who were wise.
17 I sent them all to Iddo, the leader of the descendants of Levi, who was living in
Casiphia town, to request that he and his relatives and other men who had worked
in the temple send to us some men who would go/come with us to work in God’s new
temple in Jerusalem.
18 Because God was kind to us, they brought to us a man named Sherebiah and
18 of his sons and other relatives. Sherebiah was a very wise man, a descendant of
Mahli, who was a grandson of Levi.
19 They also sent to us Hashabiah, along with Jeshaiah, descendants of Levi’s son
Merari, and 20 of their relatives.
20 They also sent 220 other men to work in the temple. Those men’s ancestors had
been appointed by King David to assist the descendants of Levi who helped the priests
in the temple. I listed/wrote the names of all those men.

trust in him, but that he becomes very angry with those who refuse to obey him. So
I would have been ashamed if I had asked the king to send soldiers and men riding
on horses to protect us from our enemies while we were traveling along the road.
23 So we ◄fasted/abstained from eating food► and requested God to protect us, and
he ◄answered our prayers/did what we requested.►
The gifts for the temple
24 I chose twelve of the leaders of the priests, Sherebiah and Hashabiah and ten of
their relatives.
25 I appointed them to supervise carrying to Jerusalem the gifts of silver and gold
and the other valuable items that the king and his advisors and other officials, and
the Israeli people who were living in Babylonia, had contributed for the temple of our
God.
26 As I gave these various items to those priests, I weighed each of the items. This
was the total: 25 tons of silver, 100 items made from silver that altogether weighed
7,500 pounds, ◄7,500 pounds/3,400 kg.► of gold,
Ezra 8:27
685
Ezra 9:4
27 20 gold bowls that altogether weighed ◄19 pounds/8.6 kg.►, and two items made
of polished bronze that were as valuable as ones made of gold.

gold and the other valuable items, in order to carry them to the temple in Jerusalem.
They returned to Jerusalem
31 On April 19, we left the Ahava Canal and started to travel to Jerusalem. Our God
took care of us, and while we traveled, he prevented our enemies and bandits from
◄ambushing us/suddenly attacking us►.
32 After we arrived in Jerusalem, we rested for three days.
33 Then on the fourth/next day we went to the temple. There the silver and gold
and the other items were weighed and given to the priest Meremoth, the son of Uriah.
Eleazar the son of Phinehas and two descendants of Levi, Jozabad the son of Jeshua
and Noadiah the son of Binnui, were with him.
34 They counted everything, and wrote down how much they weighed, and wrote
a description of each item.
35 We who had returned from Babylonia offered to God sacrifices on the altar. We
offered twelve bulls for all us Israeli people. We also offered 96 rams and 27 lambs.
We also sacrificed twelve goats to atone for the sins that all the people had committed.
These were all completely burned on the altar.
36 Some of us who returned from Babylonia took to the governors and other officials
of the province west of the Euphrates River the letter that the king had given to us.
After they read the letter, they did all that they were able to do for us Israeli people
and for the temple of God.

Ezra prayed about the Israeli people marrying foreign wives
1 Some time later, the Jewish leaders came to me and said, “Many Israelis, and even
some priests and other men who are descendants of Levi who work in the temple, have
not kept themselves from doing what the other people who are living in this land do.
They are practicing the detestable things that the Canaan, Heth, Periz, Jebus, Ammon,
and Amor people-groups, and the people from Moab and Egypt do.
2 Specifically, some Israeli men have married women who are not Israelis, and
they have allowed their sons to do the same thing. So we, God’s sacred people,
have become ◄contaminated/polluted in God’s sight►. And some of our leaders and
officials have been the first/worst ones to do this.”
3 When I heard that, I became very angry, with the result that I tore my clothes and
tore some hair from my head and from my beard. Then I sat down, very shocked/
dismayed. The Israelis knew that God had warned us that he would punish us if we
disobeyed what he had said to us about marrying women who are not Israelis.
4 So many of the Israelis trembled/were afraid when they heard that some of those
who had returned from Babylonia had sinned by disobeying the God of us Israelis
Ezra 9:5
686
like that. They came and sat with me until it was time to offer the evening sacrifices
of grain.
5 When it was time to offer those sacrifices, I was still sitting there, wearing those
torn clothes and mourning/sad. I stood up, and then I quickly prostrated myself on
the ground. I lifted up my hands to Yahweh, my God,
6 and this is what I prayed:
“Yahweh my God, I am very ashamed to raise my head in front of you. The sins
that we Israelis have committed are very great; it is as though they have risen up
higher than our heads, and our guilt for committing those sins, it is as though it
rises up to the heavens.
7 Since the time that our ancestors lived until now, we have been very guilty. That
is the reason that we and our kings and our priests have been defeated by the armies
of the kings of other lands. They killed some of our people, they captured some, they
robbed some, and they caused them all to be disgraced, just like we are today.
8 “But now, Yahweh God, you have been very kind to us. You have allowed some
of us to ◄survive/continue to live►. You have revived our spirits [IDM] and allowed
us to escape from being slaves in Babylonia and to return safely [IDM] to live in

Judah.
for us, we have disobeyed your commands.
11 They are commands that you gave to your servants, the prophets, to tell to us.
They said that the land that we would occupy was polluted because of the detestable/
disgusting things that were done by the people who lived there. They said that in the
land there were people from one end to the other who did immoral/shameful things.
12 They said, ‘Do not allow your daughters to marry their sons! Do not allow
your sons to marry their daughters! Do not even try to cause things to go well for
those people-groups! If you obey these instructions, your nation will be strong, and
you will enjoy the good crops that grow on the land, and the land will belong to your
descendants forever.’
13 “You punished us because we were very guilty for having done wicked things.
But you have not punished us as much as we deserve to be punished. I say this
because you, our God, have allowed some of us to survive.
14 However, some of us are again disobeying your commands, and we are
marrying women who do those detestable things. If we continue to do that, surely
you will get rid of all of us [RHQ], with the result that none of us will remain alive.
15 Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship/belong to, you are fair/just. We are
guilty. We are only a few people who have escaped from Babylonia, but we pray to
you, even though we do not deserve to stand in your presence.”

The men agreed to divorce their foreign wives
1 While I was kneeling down in front of the temple and praying and crying, I was
confessing the sins that the Israeli people had committed. Many people, men and
women and children, gathered around me and also cried very much.
Ezra 10:2
687
Ezra 10:16
2 Then Shecaniah, the son of Jehiel from the clan of Elam, said this to me: “We have
disobeyed God. Some of us have married women who are not Israelis. But we can
still confidently expect Yahweh to be merciful to us Israeli people.
3 We will do what you, and the others who have an awesome respect for what our
God has commanded, tell us to do. We will do what God told us in his laws. We will
make an agreement with our God, saying that we will divorce our wives who are not
Israelis, and we will send them away with their children.
4 ◄It is your responsibility to/Because you are our leader, you must► tell us what to
do. So get up, and be courageous, and do what is necessary. We will ◄support you/
tell people to do what you say►.”
5 So I stood up and demanded that the leaders of the priests, the other descendants
of Levi, and all the other Israeli people solemnly declare that they would do what
6 Then I went away from the front of the temple and went to the room where
was still sad because some of the Israelis who had returned from Babylonia had not
faithfully obeyed God’s laws.
7 Then we sent a message to all the people in Jerusalem and in other towns in Judah,
saying that all those who had returned from Babylonia should come to Jerusalem
immediately.
8 We said that if any of them did not arrive within three days, the leaders of the
people would order that all the property of those people would be taken from them,
and that they would no longer be considered to belong to the Israeli people; they
would be considered to be foreigners.
9 So within three days, on December 19, all the people of the tribes of Judah and
Benjamin gathered in Jerusalem. They were there, sitting in the courtyard in front of
the temple. They were trembling because it was raining hard and because they were
worried that they would be punished for what they had done.
10 Then I stood up and said to them, “Some of you men have committed a very bad
sin. You have married women who are not Israelis. By doing that, you have made us
Israeli people more guilty than we were before.
11 So now you must confess to Yahweh, the God whom your ancestors worshiped/
belonged to, the sin which you have committed, and you must do what he wants.
Separate yourselves from the people of other nations and from the women from
those nations whom you have married.”
12 The whole group answered, shouting loudly, “Yes, what you have said is right!
We will do what you have said.”
13 But then one of them said, “But we are a very large group, and it is raining hard.
Also, there are many of us who have committed this bad sin. This is something that
we cannot ◄take care of/handle► in one or two days, and we cannot stand here in
this rain.
14 So allow our leaders to decide for all of us what we should do. Tell everyone
who has married a woman who is not Israeli to come at a time that you decide. They
should come with the elders and judges from each city. If we do that, our God will
stop being angry with us because of what we have done.”
15 Jonathan the son of Asahel, Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah, Meshullam, and
Shabbethai, a descendant of Levi, were the only ones who objected to this.
16 All the others who had returned from Babylonia said that they would do it. So I
chose leaders of each of the clans, and I wrote down their names. On December 29,
these men came and sat down to investigate the matter.
Ezra 10:17

17 By March 27 of the next year they finished determining which men had married
women who were not Israelis.
The men who had married foreign wives

Nehemiah’s prayer
1 I am Nehemiah, the son of Hacaliah. I am writing this account of what I did when
I returned to Jerusalem. After King Artaxerxes had been ruling the Persian Empire for
almost 20 years, near the end of that year, I was in Susa, the capital of Persia.
2 My brother Hanani came to visit me. He and some other men had just returned
from Judah. I queried them about the Jews who were living there, whose parents
had been ◄exiled/taken forcefully► to Babylonia many years previously. I also asked
them about what was happening in Jerusalem.
3 They said to me, “The Jews in Jerusalem who returned there from Babylonia are
living in a very difficult situation. The walls of the city have been broken down, and
even the city gates have been burned down.”
4 When I heard that, I sat down and cried. For several days I mourned, and I
◄fasted/abstained from eating food►, and I prayed to our God, who is/rules in heaven.
5 I said, “Yahweh, you who are/rule in heaven, you are a wonderful and awesome
God. You keep your promise to faithfully love those who love you and who obey your
commands.
6 Now please look down and listen to what I am praying. I pray during the day and
at night for your Israeli people. I confess that we Israeli people have sinned. Even
my family and I have sinned against you.
7 We have acted very wickedly. Many years ago your servant Moses gave us your
laws and all the things you commanded us to do [DOU], but we have not obeyed/done
them.
8 “But please remember what you told your servant Moses. You said, ‘If you sin, I
will scatter you among the ◄heathen nations/nations that do not believe in me►.
9 But if you return to me and obey my commands, even if you have been exiled to
very remote/distant places on the earth, I will bring you back here to Israel, the land
10 “We are your servants. We are the people whom you brought here by your very
11 Yahweh, please hear this prayer of mine, and the prayers of all your people who
me a great favor. Please motivate him to act kindly toward me, in order that I will be
successful in obtaining what I want.”
At that time, I was the one whose work was to taste all the food and drink before
it was served to the king, to be sure that no one had put poison in it.

Artaxerses allowed Nehemiah to go to Jerusalem
1 After King Artaxerxes had been ruling the Persian Empire for almost 20 years,
◄during the spring/before the hot season► of that year, when it was time to serve

Nehemiah 2:16
wine to him during a feast, I took the wine and gave it to him. I had never looked sad
when I was in front of him before, but on that day he saw that I looked very sad.
2 So he asked me, “Why are you sad? I know that you are not sick. It must be that
you are troubled about something.” Then I was very afraid, because it was not proper
to be sad when I came to the king (OR, because I was worried what the king would do
to me if he refused to do what I was about to request him to do).
prevent myself from being sad, because the city where my ancestors are buried has
been destroyed and is in ruins?/I cannot keep myself from looking sad, because the
city where my ancestors are buried has been destroyed and is in ruins.► [RHQ] Even
the city gates have been completely burned.”
4 The king replied, “What do you want me to do for you?”
I prayed silently to our God who is/rules in heaven.
5 Then I replied, “If you are willing to do it, and if I have pleased you, send me to
the city of Jerusalem in Judah province where my ancestors are buried, in order that
I may help people to rebuild the city.”
6 While the queen was sitting beside the king, he asked, “If I allow you to go, how
long will you be gone? When will you return?” I told the king how long I would be
gone, and the king gave me permission to go, and I told him what day I wanted to
leave.
7 I also said to the king, “If you are willing to do it, write letters for me to take to
the governors of the province west of the Euphrates River. Tell them to allow me to
travel safely through their province until I arrive in Judah.
8 Also, please write a letter to Asaph, the man who takes care of your forest in that
area, telling him to give me timber to make the beams to support the gates of the
fortress that is near the temple, and timber for making the walls of the city, and for
building the house in which I will live.” The king did what I requested him to do,
because my God was graciously/kindly ◄helping/acting for► me.
9 After I got ready, I left to travel to Judah. The king sent some army officers and
soldiers riding on horses to accompany me, to protect me. When I came to where the
governors of the provinces west of the Euphrates River lived, I gave them the letters
that the king had written.
10 But when two government officials, Sanballat from a village near Horon and
that someone had come to help the Israeli people.
11-12 When I arrived in Jerusalem, I did not tell anyone what thoughts God had given
to me about what I should do there. Three days after I arrived in Jerusalem, I went
out of the city in the evening, taking a few other men with me. I was riding a donkey;
we had no other animals with us.
13 We left the city, going out through the Valley Gate, then past the well called the
Jackal (OR, Dragon’s) Well, and then past the gate called the Rubbish/Garbage Gate.
We inspected all the walls that had been broken down and all the gates that had been
burned down.
14 Then we went to the Fountain Gate and to the pool called the King’s Pool, but my
donkey could not get through the narrow opening (OR, the rubble).
15 So we turned back and went along the Kidron Valley. We inspected the wall there
before we turned back/around and entered the city again at the Valley Gate.
16 The city officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because I
had not told anyone about what I planned to do. I had not said anything about it to
Nehemiah 2:17
691
Nehemiah 3:12
the Jewish leaders or the officials or the priests or any of the others who would be
helping me in the work that I wanted to do.
17 But now I said to them, “You all know very well the terrible things that have
happened to our city. The city is ruined; even the gates are burned down. So we should
rebuild the city wall. If we do that, we will no longer feel humiliated/disgraced.”
18 Then I told them about how God had kindly/graciously helped me when I talked
to the king, and what the king had said to me.
They immediately replied, “Let’s start rebuilding!” So they started to do this good
work.
19 But when Sanballat, Tobiah, and Gershom the Arab king of the Kedar region heard
about what we planned to do, they made fun of us and ridiculed us. They said, “What
is this work that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king again?” [RHQ]
20 But I replied, “Our God who is/rules in heaven will help our plans to succeed. But
as for you, you have no right to decide anything about this city, because you have not
participated in what has happened in this city in previous years.”

Enemies opposed rebuilding the wall
1 When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the city wall, he was very angry.
He was enraged/furious. He made fun of us Jews.
2 While his colleagues and officials of the army troops who had come from Samaria
were listening, he said, “What do these feeble/pathetic Jews think they are doing? Do
they think that if they offer enough/many sacrifices, their gods will hear them and
enable them to finish building the wall in one day? The stones that were in the wall
previously have been weakened by being burned in a fire. Those stones that they are
pulling out of the rubbish/garbage heaps—do they think that they can make them
strong again?” [RHQ]
3 Tobiah was standing beside Sanballat. He said, “That stone wall that they are
building is very weak; so if even a fox climbed up on it, the wall would fall down!”
4 Then I prayed. I said, “Our God, hear us, because they are ridiculing us! Cause the
words of their insults to fall back on them! Allow their enemies to come and capture
them and force them to go to a foreign land!
5 They are guilty; they have said things that caused you to be angry while the people
6 But after some time, we finished building the wall around the whole city, up to
very hard.
people-group and from Ashdod city heard that the work on the wall was continuing
and that we were filling in the gaps in the wall, they became very angry.
8 They all planned to come and fight against the people of Jerusalem [MTY] and to
cause trouble.
9 But we prayed to our God to protect us, and we put men around the walls to guard
the city day and night.
10 Then the people of [MTY] Judah started to say, “The men who are working on the
wall are becoming very tired. There is a lot of heavy rubble that we must remove;
we ourselves cannot finish the work.
11 “Besides, our enemies are saying, ‘Before the Jews see us, we will swoop down
on them and kill them and stop their work on the wall!’ ”
12 The Jews who were living near our enemies came and told us many times, “You
should leave the city and go to other places, in order that your enemies will not attack
you!”
13 So I put guards at the places where the wall was not very high yet and at places
where there were gaps in the wall. I put guards to protect each of their family groups.
I gave the guards daggers, spears, and bows and arrows.
14 Then after I inspected everything, I summoned the leaders and other officials
and many of the other people, and I said to them, “Do not be afraid of our enemies!
Think about what Yahweh, who is great and glorious, can do! And fight to protect
your friends, your families, and your homes!”
15 Our enemies heard that we knew what they were planning to do and that God
were sure that God would defend us, so we all started to work on the wall again.
Nehemiah 4:16
694
Nehemiah 5:8
16 But after that, only half of the men who were working for me worked on the wall.
The others stood there on guard, holding their spears, shields, bows and arrows, and
wearing their coats made of metal plates. To encourage the peoplewho were building
the wall, their leaders stood behind them.
17 Those who carried baskets of supplies on their heads/shoulders and those who
built the wall did their work with one hand, and held a weapon with the other hand.
18 All those who were building the wall had a dagger fastened to their side. The
man who would blow the trumpet if our enemies attacked was standing at my side.
19 Then I said to the officials, the other important men, and the other people, “This
wall is very long, and we are far apart from each other along the wall.
20 If you hear the man blowing the trumpet, gather around us at that place.
Remember that our God will fight for us!”
21 So we continued to work. Half of the men continued to hold their spears all day,
from when the sun rose in the morning until the stars appeared at night.
22 At that time, I also said to the people, “Tell every worker and his helper that they
must stay inside Jerusalem at night. By doing that, they can guard us at night, and
they can work on the wall during the daytime.”
23 During that time, none of us ever took off our clothes (OR, we wore our clothes
all the time)—I and my relatives and my workers and the guards who were with me.
And we had our weapons with us, in our hands.

Nehemiah helped the oppressed people
2 Some/One of them said, “We have many children. So we need a lot of grain to be
able to eat and continue to live.”
3 Others said, “The fields and vineyards and houses that we own, it has been
necessary for us to ◄mortgage them/promise to give them to someone if we do not
pay back to him the money he has loaned us► in order to get money to buy grain,
during this ◄famine/time where there is not much food►.”
4 Others said, “We have needed to borrow money to pay the taxes that the king
commanded us to pay on our fields and our vineyards.
5 We are Jews just like [IDM] they are. Our children are ◄just as good as/equal
with► their children. But we have needed to sell some of our children to become
slaves in order to pay what we owe. We have already sold some of our daughters to
become slaves. Our fields and vineyards have been taken away from us, so now we
do not have the money to pay what we owe, and we are forced to sell our children to
get money to pay those debts.”
6 I was very angry when I heard these things that they were complaining about.
7 So I thought about what I could do about it. I told the leaders and officials who
were responsible for this work, “You are charging interest to your own relatives when
they borrow money from you!” Then I called together a large group of people,
8 and I said to their leaders, “Some of our Jewish relatives have been forced to
sell themselves to become slaves of people who have come from other countries. As
much as we have been able to, we have been buying them back out of slavery. But
now you are forcing your own relatives to sell themselves to you, their fellow Jews,
as slaves!” When I said that to them, they were silent. There was nothing that they
could say because they knew that what I said was true.
Nehemiah 5:9
695
Nehemiah 6:2
9 Then I said to them, “What you are doing is terrible [EUP]! You certainly ought to
[RHQ] obey God and do what is right! If you did that, our enemies who do not revere
Yahweh would see that we are doing what is right and would not ridicule us.
10 My fellow Jews and I and my servants have lent money and grain to people
without charging interest. So you all should stop charging interest on these loans.
11 Also, you must give back to them their fields, their vineyards, their olive tree
orchards, and their houses that you have taken from them. You must also give back
to them the interest that you charged them when they borrowed money, grain, wine,
and olive oil from you, and you must do it today!”
12 The leaders replied, “We will do what you have said. We will return to them
everything that we forced them to give to us, and we will not require that they give
us anything more.”
Then I summoned the priests, and I forced the leaders to vow in front of them that
they would do what they had promised to do.
13 I shook out the folds of my robe and said to them, “If you do not do what you
have just now promised to do, I hope/desire that God will shake you like I am shaking
my robe. He will take away your homes and everything else that you own.”
what they had promised to do.
was the king of Persia. For the next twelve years, until he had been ruling for almost
to receive to buy food because of my being the governor.
15 The men who were governors before I became the governor had burdened the
people by requiring them to pay a lot of taxes. They had forced each person to pay
to them 40 silver coins every day, in addition to giving food and wine to them. Even
their servants/officials oppressed the people. But I did not do that, because I revered
God.

were unable to pay back the money that they had borrowed from me. All those who
worked for me joined me to work on the wall.

and chickens. And every ten days I gave them a large new supply of wine. But I knew
that I was entitled/allowed to receive to buy all this food because of my being the
governor.
19 My God, do not forget me, and reward me because of all that I have done for
these people.

Plots against Nehemiah
1 Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem, and our other enemies heard a report that we had
finished rebuilding the wall, and that now there were no more ◄gaps/places where
the wall was not finished► (although we had not yet put the doors in the gates).
2 So Sanballat and Geshem sent a message to me, in which they said “Come and
talk with us at a place in Ono Plain north of Jerusalem.” But I knew that really they
wanted to harm me if I went there.
Nehemiah 6:3
696
Nehemiah 6:17
3 So I sent messengers to them, to tell them, “I am doing an important work, and
I cannot go down there. ◄Why should I stop doing this work just to go down to talk
with you?/I do not want to stop doing this work just to go down to talk with you.►”
[RHQ]
4 They sent me the same message four times, and each time when I replied to them
I said the same thing.
5 Then Sanballat sent one of his servants to me, bringing a fifth message. This one
was written, but it was not sealed. He did that in order that others would read the
message that the servant was carrying in his hand.
6 This is what was written in the message:
“Some people in the nearby countries have heard a report that you and the other
Jews are rebuilding the wall in order to be able to resist attacks, because you are
planning to revolt against the king of Babylon. And the report also says that you
are planning to become the king of the Israelis. Geshem says that what they have
reported is true.
7 People are also saying that you have appointed some prophets to proclaim
in Jerusalem that you, Nehemiah, are now the king in Judea. King Artaxerxes will
certainly hear these reports, and then you will be in big trouble. So I suggest that we
should meet together to talk about this matter.”
8 When I read that message, I sent the messenger back to Sanballat to say, “None of
what you are saying is true. You have ◄made this up/concocted this► in your own
head/mind.”
9 I said that because I knew that they were trying to cause us to be afraid, with the
result that we would stop working on the wall. So I actually became more determined
(OR, I prayed to God to help me) to continue the work.
10 One day I went to talk with Shemaiah, son of Delaiah and grandson of Mehetabel.
I went to talk with him in his house, because he was not able (OR, allowed) to leave
his house. He said to me, “You and I must enter the very sacred place in the temple
and lock the doors, because people are going to come to kill you at night.”
11 I replied, “I ◄am not that kind of person/do not do things like that► [RHQ]! I
would not run and hide in the temple to save my life! No, I will not do that!”
12 When I thought about what he had said, I realized that God had not told Shemaiah
to say that to me. I realized that Tobiah and Sanballat had bribed him to say that to
me.
13 They had bribed him to cause me to be afraid. They wanted me to disobey God’s
commands and sin by hiding in the temple. If I did that, they would be able to ruin
my reputation [MTY] and discredit me.
14 So I prayed, “My God, do not forget what Tobiah and Sanballat have done. Punish
them. And do not forget that the female prophet Noadiah and some of the other
prophets have also tried to cause me to be afraid.”
They finished building the wall
15 On October 2 we finished rebuilding the wall. We did it all in 52 days.
16 When our enemies in the nearby countries heard about that, they realized that
they had been humiliated, because everyone knew that it was because God helped
us that we had been able to do this work and that they had not been able to force us
to quit.
17 During this time, the Jewish leaders had been sending many messages/letters to
Nehemiah 7:20
18 Many people in Judea were closely associated with Tobiah, because he was the
son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah. Furthermore, Tobiah’s son Jehohanan had
married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berekiah.
19 People often talked in my presence about all the good things that Tobiah had
done, and then they would tell him everything that I said. So Tobiah sent many
letters to me to try to cause me to become afraid.

1 After the wall had been finished and we had put the gates in their places, we
assigned to the temple guards and to the members of the sacred choir and the other
descendants of Levi the work that they were to do.
2 I appointed two men to help me to govern Jerusalem, my brother Hanani and
Hananiah who was the commander of the fortress in Jerusalem. Hananiah always
did his work reliably, and he revered God more than most other people do.
3 I said to them, “Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until late each morning. And
close the gates and put the bars across the doors ◄late in each afternoon/before sunset►
while the gatekeepers are still guarding the gates.” I also told them to appoint some
people who lived in Jerusalem to be guards on the wall, and to assign some of them
to be guards at certain other places and to assign others to guard the area close to
their own houses.
A list of those who returned to Jerusalem
4 The city of Jerusalem covered a large area, but at that time not many people lived
in the city, and they had not built many new houses yet [HYP].
5 To defend the city, we needed more people there. Then God gave me the idea to
summon the leaders and officials and other people, and to look in the books in which
were written the names of all the people and their clans. So I found the records of the
people who had first returned from Babylonia. This is what I found written in those
records:
6 ◄This is a list/Here are the names► of the people who returned to Jerusalem
and to other places in Judea. They had been living in Babylonia since King
Nebuchadnezzar’s army had captured their relatives/ancestors and took them to
Babylonia. But they had returned to Judea and were living in the towns where
their ancestors had lived.
7 Their leaders were Zerubbabel, Joshua, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai,
Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah, and me.
This is a list of the number of men in each clan who returned:
8 2,172 men from the clan of Parosh;
9 372 men from the clan of Shephatiah;
10 652 men from the clan of Arah;
11 2,818 men from the clan of Pahath-Moab, who are descendants of Jeshua and
Joab;
13 845 men from the clan of Zattu;
15 648 men from the clan of Bani (OR, Binnui);
16 628 men from the clan of Bebai;
17 2,322 men from the clan of Azgad;
18 667 men from the clan of Adonikam;
19 2,067 men from the clan of Bigvai;
20 655 men from the clan of Adin;
Nehemiah 7:21
698
Nehemiah 7:58
21 98 men from the clan of Ater, whose other name is Hezekiah;
22 328 men from the clan of Hashum;
23 324 men from the clan of Bezai;
24 112 men from the clan of Hariph, whose other name is Jorah;
25 95 men from the clan of Gibeon, whose other name is Gibbar.
26 Men whose ancestors had lived in these towns also returned:
188 men from Bethlehem and Netophah
27 128 men from Anathoth;
28 42 men from Beth-Azmaveth
29 743 men from Kiriath-Jearim, Kephirah and Beeroth;
30 621 men from Ramah and Geba;
31 122 men from Micmash;
32 123 men from Bethel and Ai;
33 52 men from Nebo;
34 1,254 from Elam;
35 320 from Harim;
36 345 from Jericho;
37 721 from Lod, Hadid, and Ono;
38 3,930 from Senaah.
The following priests also returned:
39 973 from the clan of Jedaiah who are descendants of Jeshua;
40 1,052 from the clan of Immer;
41 1,247 from the clan of Pashhur;
42 1,017 from the clan of Harim.
43 Other descendants of Levi who returned were:
74 from the clan of Jeshua and Kadmiel, who are descendants of Hodevah who
is also known as Hodaviah;
44 148 singers who are descendants of Asaph.
45 Also 138 temple gatekeepers from the clans of Shallum, Ater, Talmon, Akkub,
Hatita, and Shobai returned.
46 Temple workers who returned were descendants of these men:
Ziha, Hasupha, Tabbaoth,
48 Lebanah, Hagabah, Shalmai,
50 Reaiah, Rezin, Nekoda,
52 Besai, Meunim, Ephusesim who is also called Nephusim,
54 Bazlith who is also called Bazluth, Mehida, Harsha,
55 Barkos, Sisera, Temah,
56 Neziah, and Hatipha.
57 Descendants of the servants of King Solomon who returned were:
Sotai, Sophereth who is also called Hassophereth, Perida who is also known as
Peruda,
58 Jaalah, Darkon, Giddel,
Nehemiah 7:59
699
Nehemiah 8:4
59 Shephatiah, Hattil, Pokereth-hazzebaim, and Amon.
60 Altogether,
there were 392 temple workers and descendants of Solomon’s
61-62 Another group of 642 people from the clans of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda
also returned. They came from the towns of Tel-Melah, Tel-Harsha, Kerub, Addan
(which is also known as Addon), and Immer in Babylonia. But they could not prove
that they were descendants of Israelis.
63 Priests from the clans of Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai also returned. Barzillai
had married a woman who is a descendant of a man named Barzillai from the Gilead
region, and he had taken his wife’s family name.
64 They searched in the records that contained the names of people’s ancestors,
but they could not find the names of those clans, so they were not allowed to have
the rights and duties that priests have right away.
65 The governor told them that before they could eat the food offered as sacrifices,
a priest should use the marked stones to find out what God said about their being
priests.
66 Altogether, there were 42,360 people who returned to Judea.
67 There were also 7,337 of their servants, and 245 singers, which included men
and women.
68 The Israelis also brought back from Babylonia 736 horses, 245 mules,
69 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.
70 Some of the leaders of the clans gave gifts for the work of rebuilding the temple.
I, being the governor, gave ◄17 pounds/8.6 kg.► of gold, 50 bowls to be used in the
temple, and 530 robes for the priests.
71 Some of the leaders of the clans gave a total of ◄337 pounds/153 kg.► of gold,
and ◄3,215 pounds/1,460 kg.► of silver.
72 The rest of the people gave a total of ◄337 pounds/153 kg.► of gold, ◄2,923

Ezra read from the laws of Moses
1-2 Ezra, who taught people the laws of Moses, had a scroll on which the laws of
Moses were written. Those were the laws that Yahweh had commanded the Israeli
people to obey. On October 8 of that year, all the people gathered together in the
plaza/square that was close to the Water Gate. Men and women and children who
were old enough to understand gathered together. Someone told Ezra to bring out
that scroll.
3 So he brought it out and read it to the people. He started reading it early in the
morning and continued reading it until noontime. All the people listened carefully
to the laws that were written on the scroll.
4 Ezra stood on top of a high wooden platform that had been built just for that event.
At his right side stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah. At
Nehemiah 8:5
700
Nehemiah 8:18
his left side stood Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah,
and Meshullam.
5 Ezra stood on the platform above the people, where they could all see him. He
opened the scroll; and as he did that, all the people stood up, and they continued to
stand, to show respect for God’s word.
6 Then Ezra praised Yahweh, the great God, and all the people lifted up their hands
and said, “Amen! Amen!” Then they all bowed down with their foreheads touching
the ground, and they worshiped Yahweh.
7 Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita,
Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah, were all ◄Levites/men who worked in the
temple►. They explained the meaning of the laws of Moses to the people who were
standing there.
8 They also read from scrolls that contained the laws that God gave to Moses, and
they interpreted into the Aramaic language what they read, making the meaning clear
so that the people could understand the meaning.
9 Then I, Nehemiah the governor, and Ezra, and the Levites who were interpreting
what was being read to the people, said to them, “Yahweh your God considers that
this day is very holy/sacred. So do not be sad or cry!” They said that because all the
people were crying as they were listening to the laws of Moses.
10 Then I said to them, “Now go home and enjoy some good food and drink some
sweet wine. And send some of it to people who do not have anything to eat or drink.
This is a day that Yahweh considers sacred. Do not be sad! Yahweh will cause you to
be joyful and make you strong.”
11 The Levites also caused the people to be quiet, saying “Be quiet and do not cry,
because this is a sacred day! Do not be sad!”
12 So the people went away, and they ate and drank, and they sent portions of food
and understood what had been read to them.
of Levi met with Ezra to study carefully the laws that Yahweh had given to Moses.
command the Israeli people to live in shelters during that month, to remember that
their ancestors lived in shelters when they left Egypt.
15 They also learned that they should proclaim in Jerusalem and in all the towns
that the people should go to the hills and cut branches from olive trees that they have
planted and from wild olive trees and from myrtle trees and palm trees and fig trees.
They should make shelters from these branches, and live in those shelters during the
festival, just as Moses wrote that they should do.
16 So the people went out of the city and cut branches and used them to build
shelters. They built shelters on the flat roofs of their houses, in their courtyards, in
the courtyards of the temple, and in the plazas/squares close to the Water Gate and
the Ephraim Gate.
17 All of the Israeli people who had returned from Babylon built shelters and lived
in them for one week. The Israeli people had not celebrated that festival like that
since the time that Joshua lived. And they were very joyful.
18 Every day during that week Ezra read to the people from the scroll that contained
the laws that God gave Moses. Then on the eighth day, just as one of the laws of God
said that they should do, they gathered together to end the celebration.
Nehemiah 9:1
The people confessed their sins

Nehemiah 9:15

1 On October 31, the people gathered together again. They ◄fasted/abstained from
eating food►, they wore clothes made from rough cloth, and they put dirt on their
heads to show that they were sorry for their sins.
2 The Israeli people separated themselves from all the foreigners. They stood there
and confessed their sins and the sins that their ancestors had committed.
3 The scroll that contained the laws of Yahweh, the God whom they worshiped, was
read to them for three hours. Then for three more hours they confessed their sins
and they worshiped Yahweh.
4 Some of the descendants of Levi were standing on the stairs. They were Jeshua,
Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, another Bani, and Kenani.
5 Then the leaders of the Levites called out to the people. They were Jeshua, Bani,
Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah. They said, “While you
are standing there, praise Yahweh your God, who has always lived and will live
forever!”
Then one of them continued by praying this to God,
“Yahweh, we praise your glorious name! You are much greater than anything
that we can think about or talk about!
6 “You only are God. You made the sky and the heavens and all the stars. You
made the earth and everything that is on it, and you made the seas/oceans and
everything that is in them. You are the one who gives life to everything and helps
them remain alive. All the angels who are in heaven worship you.

to► him, saying that you would give to him and to his descendants the land that the
descendants of Canaan, Heth, Amor, Periz, Jebus, and Girgash lived in. And you have
done what you promised, because you always do what is right.
9 “You saw what our ancestors were suffering in Egypt. You heard them cry to
you for help when they were at the Red Sea.
10 Because you knew that the leaders of Egypt were treating our ancestors very
arrogantly, you performed many kinds of miracles that caused the king and his
officials and all his people to suffer. As a result, you became famous then, and you
are still famous!
11 You caused the Red Sea to divide, with the result that your people walked
through it on the ground without getting their feet wet. After they were all safely
on the other side, you caused the water to come back again, and you hurled into the
deep water the soldiers of the Egyptian army that were pursuing our ancestors. Their
soldiers sank into the deep sea like stones!
12 During each day you led our ancestors with a bright cloud that resembled a
huge pillar, and each night you led them by a flaming cloud that gave them light to
show them where to walk.
13 “When our ancestors were at Sinai Mountain, you came down from heaven
and spoke to them. You gave them many regulations and instructions that are just
and reliable, and you gave them commands and laws that are good.
14 You taught them about your holy ◄Sabbath/day of rest►, and you gave many
kinds of laws to your servant Moses for him to tell to the people.
15 When they were hungry, you gave them manna from the sky; and when they
were thirsty, you gave them water from a rock. You commanded them to go and take,
from the people who lived there, the land which you had promised to give to them.
Nehemiah 9:16
702
Nehemiah 9:29
16 “But our ancestors were very proud and stubborn [IDM], and they did not do
what you commanded them to do.
17 They refused to heed you, and they forgot about all the miracles that you
had performed for them. Instead, they became stubborn [IDM], and they appointed
someone to lead them back to Egypt, where they would be slaves again! But you are
a God who forgives us and who is kind and merciful to us. You do not quickly become
angry. You always faithfully love us.
18 So, even though their leaders made an idol that resembled a calf and insulted
you by saying about the idol, ‘This is our god, who brought you up out of Egypt,’ you
did not desert them.
19 “Because you always act mercifully, you did not abandon them when they were
in the desert. The bright cloud which was like a huge pillar continued to lead them
during the daytime, and the fiery cloud showed them where to walk at night.
20 You sent your good Spirit to instruct them. You continued to provide water
when they were thirsty.

the sky, and you brought them into this land, the land that you told their fathers to
enter and occupy.
24 Their sons went in and took the land from the people that lived there. You
enabled them to defeat the descendants of Canaan who lived here in this land. You
enabled them to conquer the descendants of Canaan and their kings and the people
whom they ruled. You enabled our ancestors to do to those people whatever they
wanted to do.
25 Our ancestors captured cities that had walls around them, and they took
possession of fertile land. They took possession of houses that were full of good
things, where there were wells that were already dug. They took possession of many
vineyards and groves of olive trees and fruit trees. They ate all that they wanted to
and became fat. They were delighted in all these good things that you gave to them.
26 “But they disobeyed you and rebelled against you. They ◄turned their backs
on/rejected► your laws. They killed the prophets who warned them that they
should return to you. They badly insulted you.
27 So you allowed their enemies to defeat them. But when their enemies caused
them to suffer, they called out to you. You heard them from heaven, and because
you are very merciful, you sent them people to help them, and those leaders rescued
them from their enemies.
28 “But after there was a time of peace again, our ancestors again did things that
displeased you. So again you allowed their enemies to conquer them. But whenever
they cried out to you again to help them, you heard them from heaven, and because
you act mercifully, you rescued them many times.
29 “You warned them that they should again obey your laws, but they became
proud and stubborn, and they disobeyed your commands. They sinned by
disobeying what you commanded them to do, the things that would enable them
to live a good long life if they obeyed them. They stubbornly refused [IDM] to listen
to you and continued sinning.

30 You were patient with them for many years.
You warned them trough the

love us as you promised in your agreement with us that you would do! But now
we are experiencing great difficulties/hardships. Great troubles have come to us, to
our kings, to our other leaders, to our priests, and to our prophets. We have been
experiencing these troubles since the armies of the kings of Assyria conquered us,
and we are still experiencing them. We ask that you sincerely think about [LIT] all
these things.

greatly, but you have treated us fairly.

35 Even when they had their own kings, and they enjoyed the good things that
you did for them in this large and fertile land that you gave to them, they did not
serve you. They refused to quit doing what was evil.
36 “So now we are like slaves here in this land that you gave to our ancestors, the
land that you gave to them in order that they could enjoy all the good things that
grow here.
37 Because we have sinned, we cannot eat the things that grow here. The kings
that now rule over us are enjoying the things that grow here. They rule us and
take our cattle. We have to serve them and do the things that please them. We are
experiencing great misery/distress.
The people’s agreement
38 “However, we Israeli people now are making an agreement/promise to obey you,
and we are writing this agreement/promise on a scroll. We will write on it the names
of our leaders and the names of the Levites and the names of the priests, and then
we will seal it.”

The agreement
28 Then the rest of the people also made a solemn agreement.
The people who
did it included priests, temple gatekeepers, singers, and temple workers. They also
included all the men from other countries who had separated themselves from the
other foreigners living in Israel. These men, along with their wives, their sons and
daughters who were old enough to understand what they were doing, were people
who wanted to obey God’s laws.
29 They all joined with their leaders in making this solemn agreement. They agreed
to obey all the laws that God had given to Moses. They agreed to obey everything
that Yahweh our God had commanded, and all his regulations and instructions. And
this is what they promised to do:
30 “We will not allow our daughters to marry people who live in this land who
do not worship Yahweh, and we will not allow our sons to marry them.
31 “If people from other countries who live in this land bring us grain or other
things to sell to us on Sabbath days or any other sacred day, we will not buy anything
from them. And in every seventh year, we will not plant any crops, and we will
◄cancel all debts/declare that people will no longer have to pay back what they
owe us►.
32 “We also promise that every year we will pay ◄one-eighth of an ounce/ 4
grams► of silver for the work of taking care of the temple.
33 With that money they can buy these things: The sacred bread that is placed
before God, the grain that is burned on the altar each day, the lambs that were
completely burned on the altar, the sacred offerings for the Sabbath days and for
celebrating each new moon and other festivals that God told us to celebrate, and
other offerings that are dedicated to God, the animals to be sacrificed to atone for
the sins of the Israeli people, and anything else that is needed for the work of taking
care of the temple.
34 “Each year the priests, the other descendants of Levi who help the priests,
and the rest of us will ◄cast lots/throw marked stones► to determine for that year
which clans will provide wood to burn on the altar the sacrifices that are offered
to Yahweh our God, in order to do what was written in the laws God gave to Moses.
Nehemiah 10:35
705
Nehemiah 11:8
35 “We promise that each year each family will take to the temple an offering
from the first grain that we harvest and from the first fruit that grows on our trees
36 “Also, we will take to the priests at the temple our firstborn sons and dedicate
them to God. And we will also bring firstborn calves and lambs and baby goats to
be offered as sacrifices. That is what is written in God’s laws that we must do.
37 “We will also take to the priests at the temple the flour made from the first
grain that we harvest each year, and our other offerings of wine, olive oil, and fruit.
We will also take to the descendants of Levi who help the priests the tithes/10% of
the crops that we grow on our land, because they are the ones who collect the tithes
in all the villages where we work/live.
38 The priests who are descendants of Aaron will be with the other descendants
of Levi and supervise them when they collect the tithes. Then the descendants of
Levi must take 10% of the things that people bring and put them in the storerooms
in the temple.
39 The descendants of Levi and some of the other Israeli people must take 10%
of the offerings of grain, wine, and olive oil to the storerooms where the various
utensils that are used in the temple are kept. That is the place where the priests who
are serving at that time, the temple guards, and those who sing in the temple choir
live.
We promise that we will not neglect taking care of the temple of our God.”

workers, and the descendants of King Solomon’s servants, and many of the other
people lived on their own property in the towns where their ancestors had lived.
4 But some people from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin decided to live in
Jerusalem. One of them from the tribe of Judah was Athaiah. He was the son of
Uzziah, who was the son of Zechariah, who was the son of Amariah, who was the son
of Shephatiah, who was the son of Mahalalel, who was a descendant of Judah’s son
Perez.
5 Another one from the tribe of Judah was Maaseiah, who was the son of Baruch, who
was the son of Colhozeh, who was the son of Hazaiah, who was the son of Adaiah,
who was the son of Joiarib, who was the son of Zechariah, who was a descendant of
Judah’s son Shelah.
6 There were 468 men who were descendants of Perez who were valiant/courageous
soldiers who lived in Jerusalem.
7 One of the men of the tribe of Benjamin who decided to live in Jerusalem was Sallu,
the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son
of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah.
8 Two of Sallu’s relatives, Gabbai and Sallai, also settled in Jerusalem.
Altogether, 928 people from the tribe of Benjamin settled in Jerusalem
11 Seraiah, the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of
Meraioth, the son of Ahitub who had previously been the Supreme Priest.
12 Altogether, 822 members of that clan worked in the temple.
Another priest who settled in Jerusalem was Adaiah, the son of Jeroham, the son
of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of
Malchijah.
13 Altogether, there were 242 members of that clan who were leaders of the clan
who settled in Jerusalem.
Another priest who settled in Jerusalem was Amashsai the son of Azarel, the son of
Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer.
14 There were 128 members of that clan who were valiant soldiers who settled in
Jerusalem. Their leader was Zabdiel the son of Haggedolim.
15 Another descendant of Levi who settled in Jerusalem was Shemaiah the son of
Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni.
16 Two others were Shabbethai and Jozabad, who were prominent men who
supervised the work outside the temple.
17 Another one was Mattaniah, the son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph.
Mattaniah directed the temple choir when they sang the prayers to thank God. His
assistant was Bakbukiah. Another one was Abda, the son of Shammua, the son of
Galal, the son of Jeduthun.
18 Altogether, there were 284 descendants of Levi who settled in Jerusalem.
19 The men who guarded the temple gates were Akkub and Talmon and 172 of their
relatives who settled in Jerusalem.
20 The other Israeli people including priests and other descendants of Levi lived on
their own property in other towns and cities in Judea.
21 But the temple workers lived on Ophel Hill in Jerusalem. They were supervised
by Ziha and Gishpa.
22 The man who supervised the other descendants of Levi who helped the priests
and lived in Jerusalem was Uzzi, the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of
Mattaniah, the son of Mica. Uzzi belonged to the clan of Asaph, the clan that was in
charge of the music in the temple.
23 The king of Persia had commanded that the clans should decide what each clan
should do to lead the music in the temple each day.
24 Pethahiah, the son of Meshezabel, who was from the clan of Zerah and a
descendant of Judah, was the ambassador of the Israelis to the king of Persia.
25 Some of the people who did not settle in Jerusalem lived in villages close to their
farms. Some from the tribe of Judah lived in villages near Kiriath-Arba, Dibon, and
Jekabzeel cities.
26 Some lived in Jeshua city, in Moladah city, in Beth-Pelet city,
27 in Hazar-Shual city, and in Beersheba city and the villages near it.
28 Others lived in Ziklag city, in Meconah city and the villages near it,
29 in En-Rimmon city, in Zorah city, in Jarmuth city,
30 in Zanoah city, in Adullam city, and in the villages near those cities. Some lived
in Lachish city and in the nearby villages, and some lived in Azekah town and the

villages near it. All of those people lived in Judea, in the area between Beersheba in
the south and Hinnom Valley in the north, at the edge of Jerusalem.
31 The people of the tribe of Benjamin lived in Geba city, Micmash city, Aija city
which is also known as Ai, Bethel city and in nearby villages,
32 in Anathoth city, in Nob city, in Ananiah town,
33 in Hazor city, in Ramah city, in Gittaim city,
34 in Hadid city, in Zeboim town, in Neballat town,
35 in Lod town, in Ono town, and in Craftsmen’s Valley.

All those men were leaders of the priests during the time that Jeshua was the Supreme
Priest.
8 Some of the other descendants of Levi who returned were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel,
Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah. They were in charge of singing songs to thank God.
9 Bakbukiah, Unni, and other descendants of Levi formed a choir that stood opposite
the other group and sang in reply to them.

A list of descendants of Jeshua the Supreme Priest
10 Jeshua who was the Supreme Priest was the father of Joiakim, who was the father
of Eliashib, who was the father of Joiada,
11 who was the father of Jonathan, who was the father of Jaddua.
Leaders of the clans of priests
12 When Joiakim was the Supreme Priest, these were the leaders of the clans of
priests:
Meraiah, from the clan of Seraiah;
Hananiah, from the clan of Jeremiah;
13 Meshullam, from the clan of Ezra;
Jehohanan, from the clan of Amariah;
14 Jonathan, from the clan of Malluch;

Duties of priests and Levites
22 During the years that Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua were Supreme Priests,
they ◄wrote/kept a list of► the names of the clans who were descendants of Levi.
When Darius was the king of Persia, they stopped writing that list.
23 They wrote the names of the leaders of the clans who were descendants of Levi
in the Book of Events in Israel, but they stopped writing those names when Eliashib’s
grandson Johanan was the Supreme Priest.
24 These are the leaders of the clans who are descendants of Levi: Hashabiah,
Sherebiah, Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel and others who were divided into two groups.
The two groups faced each other, one group replying to the other, during the time
that they praised and thanked God. They did that just as King David, the man who
served God well, had instructed.
25 These singers included Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, and Obadiah.
The men who guarded the storerooms close to the gates of the temple were
Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub.
26 They did that work during the time that Joiakim, who was the son of Jeshua and
the grandson of Jehozadak, was the Supreme Priest, and I was the governor, and Ezra
was the priest who knew the Jewish laws very well.
Nehemiah dedicated the wall
27 When we dedicated the wall around Jerusalem, we summoned the descendants
of Levi who help the priests from the nearby places where they were living. We asked
them to join with us to celebrate when we dedicated the wall. We wanted them to

came to Jerusalem from nearby areas where they had settled, and from places around
29 and from three places northeast of Jerusalem—Beth Gilgal city and the areas
30 When they came to Jerusalem, the priests and other descendants of Levi who help
the priests performed rituals to cause themselves to be acceptable to God, and then
they performed similar rituals to purify the other people, the gates, and the wall.
31 Then I gathered together the leaders of Judah on top of the wall, and I appointed
them to lead two large groups to march around the city on top of the wall, thanking
God. As they faced the city, one group walked to the right toward the Dung Gate.
32 Behind their leaders marched Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah.
33-35 Behind them marched a group of priests who were blowing trumpets. They
were Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah. Next
came Zechariah, the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the
son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, a descendant of Asaph.

of the wall. I followed them with half of the people. We marched past the Tower of
the Ovens to the Broad Wall.
39 From there we marched past Ephraim Gate, Jeshanah Gate, the Fish Gate, the
Tower of Hananel, the Tower of the Hundred Soldiers, to the Sheep Gate. We finished
marching near the gate into the temple.
40 Both the groups reached the temple while they were thanking God. They stood
in their places there. The leaders who were with me also stood with me in our places.
41 My group included these priests who were all blowing trumpets: Eliakim,
Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, Hananiah,
42 another Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and
Ezer. The singers, whose leader was Jezrahiah, sang loudly.
43 After we went outside the temple, we offered many sacrifices. We men all rejoiced
because God had caused us to be very happy. The women and the children also
rejoiced. People far away could hear the noise that we made there in Jerusalem.
Preparations for worship in the temple
44 On that day, men were appointed {they appointed men} to be in charge of the
storerooms where they kept the money that people contributed for the temple. They
also kept there the other things that the people contributed— the tithes and the first
part of the grain and fruit that was harvested each year. Those men collected those
things from the fields/farms near the cities, and took them to Jerusalem and gave them
to the priests and the other descendants of Levi, as Moses had said in his laws that
they should do. All the Israeli people were happy about the work that the priests and
the descendants of Levi did,
45 because they performed the rituals to purify things, and the other rituals that
God had commanded. The musicians in the temple also did their work as King David
and his son Solomon had declared that they should do.
46 Ever since the time that David had been the king and Asaph had been his chief
musician, the musicians had led the people while they sang songs to praise and thank
God.
47 During the years that Zerubbabel and I governed the Israeli people, they all
contributed the food that the singers and temple gatekeepers needed each day. They
gave ◄a tithe/10%► of their crops to the descendants of Levi who helped the priests,
and those descendants of Levi gave ◄a tithe/10%► of that to the priests, who were
descendants of Aaron the first Supreme Priest.
13
Foreigners were excluded
1 On that day, when someone read to the people parts of the laws that God gave to
Moses, they read where it was written that no one from the Ammon people-group or
the Moab people-group was ever to be allowed to be with God’s people while they
were gathered together to worship.
2 The reason for that was that the people of Ammon and the people of Moab did
not give/sell any food or water to the Israelis while the Israelis were going through
Nehemiah 13:3
710
Nehemiah 13:17
to Balaam in order that he would curse the Israelis. But God commanded Balaam to
bless the people, not to curse them.
3 So when the people heard these laws being read to them, they sent away all the
people whose ancestors had come from other countries.
Purifying the storerooms
Eliashib the priest had been appointed to be in charge of the
storerooms in the temple. He was a relative of our enemy Tobiah.
5 He allowed Tobiah to use a large room in which they had previously stored the
grain offerings and the incense, the equipment that is used in the temple, the offerings
that the people had brought for the priests, and the tithes of grain and wine and olive
oil that God had commanded the people to bring to the other descendants of Levi,
and to the temple musicians, and to the temple guards.
6 While Tobias was using that room, I was not in Jerusalem, because in the 32nd
year that Artaxerxes was the king of Babylonia, I went back there to report to him.
After a while I requested the king to allow me to return to Jerusalem, and he allowed
me to go.
7 When I arrived in Jerusalem, I found out that Eliashib had done an evil thing by
allowing Tobiah to use a room in God’s temple.
8 I became very angry, and I threw out of that room everything that belonged to
Tobiah.
9 Then I commanded that they perform a ritual to make the rooms ◄pure/acceptable
to God► again. And I also ordered that all the equipment used in the temple and all
the grain offerings and incense should be put in that room again.
10 I also found out that the temple musicians and other descendants of Levi had left
Jerusalem and returned to their fields/farms, because the Israeli people had not been
bringing to them the food that they needed.
11 So I rebuked the officials, saying to them, “◄Why have you not taken care of the
work in the temple?/It is disgraceful that you have not taken care of the work in the
temple.►” [RHQ] So I brought the descendants of Levi and the musicians back to the
temple, and told them to do their work there again.
12 Then all the people of Judah again started to bring to the temple storerooms their
tithes of grain, wine, and olive oil.
13 I appointed these men to be in charge of the storerooms: Shelemiah, who was
a priest; Zadok, who knew the Jewish laws very well; and Pedaiah, a descendant
of Levi. I appointed Hanan, who is the son of Zaccur and grandson of Mattaniah, to
assist them. I knew that I could trust these men while they distributed those offerings
to their fellow workers.
14 My God, do not forget all these good things that I have faithfully done for your
temple and for the work that is done there!
4 Previously,
Other reforms instituted by Nehemiah
15 During that time, I saw some people in Judea who were working
on the Sabbath
wine, baskets of grapes, figs, and many [HYP] other things, on their donkeys and
taking them into Jerusalem. I warned them that they should not sell things to the
people of Judea on Sabbath days.
16 I also saw some people from Tyre city who were living there in Jerusalem who
were bringing fish and other things into Jerusalem to sell to the people of Judea on
the Sabbath day.
17 So I rebuked the Jewish leaders and told them, “This is [RHQ] a very evil thing
that you are doing! You are causing the Sabbath days to be unholy.
Nehemiah 13:18
711
Nehemiah 13:31
18 Your ancestors did [RHQ] things like that, so God punished them, and as a result,
this city was destroyed! And now by causing the Sabbath day to be unholy, you are
going to cause God to be angry with us Israeli people and punish us more!”
19 So I ordered that at ◄the beginning of every Sabbath day/every Friday evening►
they should shut the gates of the city before it became dark. I also ordered that they
should not open the gates until ◄the Sabbath day was ended the next day/Saturday
evening►. Then each Sabbath day I put some of my men at the gates, so they would
make sure that nothing to sell was brought into the city on that day.
20 One or two times merchants [DOU] stayed outside of the city on ◄Friday night/the
night before the Sabbath day►.
21 I warned them, “It is useless [RHQ] for you to stay here outside the walls on
Friday night! If you do this again, I will tell my men to arrest you!” So after that, they
did not come on Sabbath days.
22 I also commanded the descendants of Levi to perform the ritual to purify
themselves and to guard the city gates, to make sure that the Sabbath was kept holy
by not allowing merchants to enter it on Sabbath days.
My God, do not forget this also that I have done for you! And because of your
faithfully loving me, allow me to continue to live many more years!
23 During that time, I also found out that many of the Jewish men had married
women from Ashdod city, and from the Ammon and Moab people-groups.
24 The result was that half of their children spoke the language that people in
Ashdod speak or some other language, and they didn’t know how to speak our
language.
25 So I rebuked those men, and I asked God to curse them, and I beat them and
pulled out some of their hair. Then I forced them to solemnly promise, knowing that
God [MTY] was listening, that they would never again marry foreigners, and never
allow their children to marry foreigners.
26 I said to them, “Solomon, the king of Israel, sinned [RHQ] as a result of marrying
foreign women. He was greater than any of the kings of other nations. God loved
him, and caused him to become the king of all the Israeli people, but his foreign wives
caused even him to sin.
27 Do you think that we should do what you have done, and disobey our God by
marrying foreign women who worship idols? [RHQ]”
28 One of the sons of Jehoiada, the son of Eliashib the Supreme Priest, had married
the daughter of our enemy Sanballat, from Beth-Horon town. So I forced Jehoiada’s
29 My God, do not forget that those people who have married foreign women have
the agreement that you made with the priests and with the other descendants of Levi
who help the priests►!
30 I did all that to make sure that there were no more foreign people among
the Israeli people who would encourage them to worship idols. I also established
regulations for the priests and other descendants of Levi, in order that they would
know what work they should do.
31 I also arranged for people to bring the firewood that was needed to burn on the
altar, as Moses had declared that we should do. I also arranged for the people to bring
the first part of what they harvested each year.
My God, do not forget that I have done all these things, and bless me for doing them!

Esther 1:13-14
This book contains the account of Esther, the queen of
Persia, protecting the Jewish people from Haman, who
wanted to destroy them. We call this book
Esther
The king of Persia deposed his queen
1 King Xerxes ruled a very big empire which had 127 provinces. It extended from
India in the east to Ethiopia in the west.
2 He ruled the empire while he lived in the capital city, Susa.
3 During the third year that he ruled his empire, he invited all his administrators
and other officials to a big banquet/feast. He invited all the commanders of the armies
of Persia and Media to come to the banquet. He also invited the governors and other
leaders of the provinces.
4 The celebration lasted for six months. During that time the king showed his guests
all his wealth and other things that showed how great his kingdom was (OR, how
great a king he was).
5 At the end of those six months, the king invited people to another banquet. He
invited to the banquet all the men who worked in the palace, including those who
had important jobs and those who had unimportant jobs. This celebration lasted for
seven days. It was in the courtyard of the palace in Susa.
6 In the courtyard were beautiful blue and white curtains that were fastened by
white and purple cords/ribbons to rings that were on pillars made from expensive
white stone called marble. The guests sat on gold and silver couches. The couches
were on a pavement/floor which had on top of it designs made from various kinds of
expensive stones.
7 The guests drank wine from gold cups. Each cup had a different design on it.
8 There was a lot of wine, because the king wanted the guests to drink as much
as they wanted. But the king told the servants that they should not force anyone to
drink more than he wanted.
9 At the same time, the king’s wife, Queen Vashti, invited the wives of the men who
10 On the last/ seventh day of those banquets, when King Xerxes was partially
drunk from drinking wine, he summoned seven of his personal servants. They were

So that caused the king to become very angry.
important officials in Persia and Media. They were the men whom he often asked
◄for their advice/what he should do►. And they were men who knew all the customs
and laws of Persia. Their names were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres,
Marsena, and Memucan.
Esther 1:15
713
Esther 2:7
15 The king said to them, “Queen Vashti has refused to obey me when I sent my
servants to tell her to come here. What do our laws say that we should do to someone
who acts/behaves like that?”
16 While the other officials were present, Memucan told the king, “Your majesty,
Queen Vashti has ◄insulted/done wrong against► you, but she has also insulted all
your officials and everyone else ◄in your empire/that you rule over►.
17 All the women throughout the empire will hear what she has done, and they will
say, ‘The king commanded Queen Vashti to come to him, and she refused.’ So they
will not obey their husbands. Instead, they will begin to not respect their husbands.
18 Before this day ends, the wives of all us officials in Persia and Media will hear
what the queen did, and they also will refuse to obey their husbands. They will not
respect us, and they will cause us to become very angry.
19 So if it pleases you, O king, you should write a law. Like all the other laws of
Persia and Media, it will be a law that ◄no one can change/cannot be changed.►
Write a law that states that Queen Vashti will never be allowed to see you again and
will not continue to be the queen. Then you can choose another woman to be queen,
a woman who deserves to be queen more than Vashti does.
20 Then, when everyone in your empire hears what you have commanded, all the
women, including those who are important and those who are not important, will
respect and obey their husbands.”
21 The king and the other officials liked what Memucan suggested, so he did that.
He wrote a law proclaiming that.
22 Then he sent letters to all the provinces, stating that all men should have complete
authority over their wives and their children. He wrote the letters in every language
and type of writing/alphabet that was used in each province.
2
Esther became the new queen
1 After a while, King Xerxes quit being so angry.
He thought about Vashti, and he
thought about the law he had made because of what she had done, and he wanted
another wife.
2 So his personal servants said to him, “Your majesty, you should send some men
to search throughout the empire for some beautiful young women/virgins for you.
3 After they find some, you can appoint some officials in each province to bring them
Then Hegai, the man who is in charge of these women, can arrange for ointments to
4 Then the woman who pleases you most can become queen instead of Vashti.” The
king liked what they suggested, so he did it.
5 At that time there was a Jew living in Susa, the capital, whose name was Mordecai,
the son of Jair. Jair was a descendant of Shimei. Shimei was a descendant of King
Saul’s father Kish. They were all from the tribe descended from Benjamin.
6 Many years before that, King Nebuchadnezzar had taken ◄Mordecai/Mordecai’s
family► and brought them from Jerusalem to Babylon, at the same time he brought
King Jehoiachin of Judah and many other people to Babylon.
7 Mordecai had a cousin whose Hebrew name was Hadassah. She had a beautiful
face and beautiful body/figure. Her Persian name was Esther. After her father and
mother died, Mordecai took care of Esther as though she were his own daughter.

Esther 2:23
8 After the king commanded that they search for some beautiful women, they brought
Esther and many other young women to the king’s palace in Susa, and ◄the king put
Hegai/Hegai was put► in charge of them.
9 Hegai was very pleased with Esther, and he treated her well. He immediately
arranged for her to be given ointments to make her even more beautiful, and he
ordered that special food would be given to her. He arranged that seven maids from
the king’s palace would take care of her, and arranged that she/they would stay in the
best rooms.
10 Esther did not tell anyone that she was a Jew, because Mordecai had told her not
to tell anyone.
11 Every day Mordecai walked near the courtyard of the place where those women
stayed. He asked people who entered the courtyard to find out and tell him what was
happening to Esther.
12 Before these women were taken to the king, they put ointments on the bodies of
these women for one year to make them more beautiful. For six months they rubbed
olive oil mixed with myrrh on their bodies each day. For the next six months they
rubbed ointments and perfumes on their bodies.
13 Then, when one of these women was summoned to go to the king, she was allowed
to wear whatever clothes and jewelry she chose.
14 In the evening, they would take her to the king’s own room. The next morning,
they would take her to another place where the women who had slept with the king
stayed. There another official whose name was Shaashgaz was in charge of those
women. Those women would live there for the rest of their lives, and one of those
women would go back to the king again only if the king very much wanted her to
15-16 Everyone who saw Esther liked her. After King Xerxes had been ruling for
during the middle part of the winter. She wore only the things that Hegai suggested.
17 The king liked Esther more than he liked any of the other women that they
brought to him. He liked her so much that he put on her head the queen’s crown,
and he declared that Esther would be the queen instead of Vashti.
18 To celebrate her becoming the queen, he had a big banquet/feast prepared for all
and he declared that in all the provinces there would be a holiday, a time when people
19 Later all those women who had spent a night with the king were gathered
20 But Esther still did not tell anyone that she was a Jew. She continued to do what
21 One day when Mordecai was doing his work in the palace, two of the king’s
officials were there. Their names were Bigthana and Teresh. They were the guards
who stood outside the king’s own rooms. They became angry with the king, and they
were planning how they could assassinate/kill him.
22 But Mordecai heard about what they were planning, and he told that to Queen
Esther. Then she told the king what Mordecai had found out.
23 The king investigated and found out that Mordecai’s report was true. So the king
ordered that those two men be hanged. When that was done, ◄an official wrote a
report/a report was written► about it in a book called ‘The book that records what
happened while Xerxes was king’.

Haman planned to kill to the Jews
1 Some time later, King Xerxes ◄promoted/gave his most important job/work to►
Haman, the son of Hammedatha, who was a descendant of King Agag. Haman became
more important than all his other officials. Only the king was more important.
2 Then the king commanded that all the other officials had to bow down in front
of Haman to honor him when he walked by. But Mordecai refused to bow down to
Haman.
3 The other officials saw that, and they asked Mordecai, “Why do you disobey what
the king commanded?”
4 Mordecai told them that he was a Jew, and that Jews would bow down only to God.
Day after day the other officials spoke to Mordecai about that, but he still refused to
obey. So they told Haman about it, to see if Haman would tolerate it.
5 When Haman saw that Mordecai would not bow down to him, he became
extremely angry.
6 After he found out that Mordecai was a Jew, he decided that it would not be enough
to get rid of only Mordecai. He decided to kill all the Jews in all the area that Xerxes
ruled.
7 So, during the twelfth year that Xerxes was ruling, during the month of April,
Haman told his advisors to ◄cast lots/throw small marked stones► to determine the
best month and the best day to kill the Jews. Haman’s advisors did that, and the day
that was selected was March 7th during the following/next year.
8 Then Haman went to the king and said to him, “Your majesty, there is a certain
group of people who live in many areas of your empire whose customs are different
from ours. They even refuse to obey your laws. So it would be good for you to get
rid of them.
9 If it pleases you, command that they should all be killed. If you do that, I will give
◄375 tons/750,000 pounds► of silver to your administrators so that you can use it for
10 The king liked what Haman said, so, and to confirm what he decided, he gave the
11 The king told Haman, “Keep your money, but do what you want to with those
people whom you talked about!”
12-13 On April 17th Haman summoned the king’s secretaries, and he dictated a letter
to them that they translated and wrote to all the governors and administrators and
other officials in all the provinces. They wrote copies of the letter in every language
and every kind of writing/alphabet that was used in the empire. They wrote that
all the Jews, including young people and old people, women and children, had to be
killed on one day. That day was March 7th of the following year. They also wrote
that those who killed the Jews could take everything that belonged to the Jews. They
signed the king’s name at the end of the letters. Then they sealed the letters with wax,
and stamped the wax by using the king’s ring. Then they sent the letters swiftly to
every province in the empire,
14 The king also commanded that copies of these letters should be nailed up where
all the people could see them, in every province, so that the people would be ready
to do on the day the king had set what was written in the letter.
15 Then, according to what the king commanded, men riding horses took those
letters quickly to every province in the empire. And one of the letters was read aloud
to the people in the capital city, Susa. Then the king and Haman sat down and drank
wine, but the people in Susa were very perplexed about why this was going to happen.

Mordecai requested help from Esther
1 When Mordecai found out about those letters, he was so anguished that he tore
his clothes and put on rough sackcloth and threw ashes over himself. Then he went
into the city, crying very loudly.
2 He stood outside the gate of the palace, because no one who was wearing sackcloth
was allowed to enter the palace.
3 In every province of the empire, when the letter from the king was read to the
Jewish people, they cried and mourned. They ◄fasted/abstained from eating food►,
and wailed loudly. Many of them also put on sackcloth and threw ashes on themselves
and lay on the ground.
4 When Esther’s maids and other officials came to her and told her what Mordecai
had done, she was very distressed. So she sent to Mordecai some good clothes to wear
instead of the sackcloth, but he refused to take them.
5 Then Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king’s officials whom he had
appointed to help take care of Esther. She told him to go out and talk to Mordecai to
find out what was distressing him and why he was wearing sackcloth to show that he
was grieving.
6 Hathach went to Mordecai, who was in the plaza in front of the palace gate.
7 Mordecai told him everything that had happened. He told him how much money
Haman had promised to give to the government if the king commanded that all the
Jews be killed.
8 Mordecai also gave to Hathach a copy of the decree that had been read in Susa,
in which it was stated that all the Jews must be killed. He told Hathach to show the
Then he told him to urge her to go to the king and request the king to act mercifully
9 So Hathach returned to Esther and told her what Mordecai said.
11 “There is a law about people going to talk to the king. All the king’s officials and
all the people in the empire know this law. In that law it states that anyone who
goes to the king in his inner court without having been summoned by the king must
be executed. Only those to whom the king has extended his scepter/staff will not be
executed. And a month has passed since the king has summoned me, so what will
happen to me if I try to see him and he doesn’t want to see me?”
12 So Hathach went back to Mordecai and told him what Esther had said.
13 Mordecai replied, “Go back and tell this to Esther: 'Do not think that just because
you live there in the palace, you will escape when all the other Jews are killed.
14 If you say nothing now, someone from some other place will rescue many of
us Jews, but you and your relatives will be killed. Furthermore, ◄perhaps God/who
knows if God► has put you here as queen ◄for a situation like this/to prevent this
15 Then after Hathach told this to Esther, she told him to return to Mordecai and
say this to him:
16 “Gather together all the Jews here in Susa, and tell them to ◄fast/abstain from
food► for my sake. Tell them to not eat or drink anything for three days and nights.
My maids and I will also fast. Then, I will go to talk to the king. Even if ◄I am
executed/they execute me► for disobeying the law by seeing him when he does not
hold out the scepter/staff toward me, I am willing for that to happen”.
Esther 4:17
717
Esther 5:14
17 So after Hathach told this to Mordecai, Mordecai went and did what Esther told
him to do.

Esther invited Haman and the king to a banquet
1 Three days later, Esther prepared a big banquet/feast. Then she
put on the robes
that showed that she was queen, and she went to the inner courtyard of the palace,
across from the room where the king was. He was sitting on the throne, facing the
entrance of the room.
2 When the king saw Esther standing there in the courtyard, he extended the gold
scepter/staff toward her to signal that he would be glad to talk to her. So Esther came
close and touched the tip of the scepter/staff.
3 Then the king asked her, “Esther, what do you want? Tell me, and I will give you
what you want, even if you ask me to give you half of my kingdom!”
4 Esther replied, “Your majesty, if it pleases you, you and Haman come to the
banquet that I have prepared for you!”
5 The king said to his servants, “Go and tell Haman to come quickly to a banquet
that Esther has prepared for the two of us!” So the king and Haman went to the
6 While they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, “Tell me what you really
7-8 Esther replied, “I will tell you what I want most of all. Your majesty, if you are
pleased with me, and if you are willing to give me what I am requesting, please come
again tomorrow to another banquet that I will prepare for the two of you. Then I
will tell you what I really want”.
Haman planned to kill Mordecai
9 Haman was feeling very happy as he left the banquet. But then he saw Mordecai
sitting at the gate of the palace. Mordecai did not stand up and tremble fearfully in
front of Haman, so Haman became extremely angry.
10 However, he did not show that he was angry; he just went home. Then he
gathered together his wife Zeresh and his friends,
11 and he boasted to them about being very rich, and about having many children.
He also boasted that the king had greatly honored him, and that the king had
◄promoted him/given him the second-most important job in the empire►, so that
all the other officials had to respect him.
12 Then Haman added, “And that is not all! Queen Esther invited just two of us, the
king and me, to a banquet she prepared for us today. And she is inviting only the two
of us to another banquet that she will prepare tomorrow!”
13 Then Haman said, “But those things ◄mean nothing to me/do not make me
happy► while I keep seeing that Jew, Mordecai, just sitting there at the gate of the
palace and ignoring me!”
14 So Haman’s wife Zeresh and all his friends who were there suggested, “Why don’t
you quickly set up ◄a gallows/posts on which to hang someone►. Make it 75 feet tall.
Then tomorrow morning ask the king to hang Mordecai on it. After that, you can go
to the banquet with the king and be cheerful.” That idea pleased Haman very much,
so he gave men orders to set up the gallows/posts.
6
The king honored Mordecai
Esther 6:1
718
Esther 7:1
1 That night the king was unable to sleep, so he summoned a servant and
told him
to bring the records of what had happened during all the time he had been king. So
the servant brought the records and read some of them to the king.
2 The servant read about Bigthana and Teresh, the two men who had guarded the
entrance to the king’s rooms. He read the account of when Mordecai had found out
that they planned to assassinate the king and that he had told the king about it.
3 The king asked some of his servants, “What did we do to reward Mordecai or show
that we appreciate what he did?” The servants replied, “We did not do anything for
him.”
4 At that moment, Haman entered the outer courtyard of the palace. He wanted to
talk to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had just set up. The
king saw him and said, “Who is that out there in the courtyard?”
said, “Bring him in here!”
want to honor?” Haman thought to himself, “◄Whom would the king like to honor
me!►” [RHQ]
7 So he replied to the king, “If there is someone you wish to honor,
8 you should tell your servants to bring him one of the robes you wear you to show
that you are the king. Also tell them to bring one of the horses you have ridden. Tell
them to put a fancy headdress on the horse’s head to show that it belongs to you, the
king.
9 Then tell one of your very important officials to put the robe on the man whom
you want to honor, and tell that man to sit on the horse, and then lead the horse
through the city streets. And tell that official to keep shouting, ‘This is what ◄the
king does/is doing► for the man whom he wants to honor!’ ”
10 The king replied to Haman, “Fine! Go and do what you said immediately! Get my
robe and my horse, and do just what you suggested! Do it for Mordecai, the Jew, who
is sitting outside at the gate of the palace. Do not forget anything that you suggested!”
11 So Haman did what the king said. He got the robe and the horse. He put the robe
on Mordecai, and as Mordecai sat on the horse, Haman led the horse through the city
streets proclaiming “This is what the king ◄does/is doing► for the man whom the
king wants to honor!”
12 Then, Mordecai returned and sat at the gate of the palace. But Haman hurried
home, covering his face because he felt completely disgraced/humiliated.
13 He told his wife Zeresh and his friends everything that had happened to him that
day. Then his wife and his friends said to him, “Mordecai, the man who has caused
you to be completely disgraced/humiliated, is a Jew. It is clear that the God whom the
Jews worship is fighting for them. So you will never be able to defeat Mordecai. He
will defeat you!”
14 And while they were still talking, some of the king’s officials arrived to take
Haman quickly to the banquet/feast that Esther had prepared.
7
Haman was executed
1 So the king and Haman went to eat the second banquet/feast that Queen Esther
had prepared.
Esther 7:2
719
Esther 8:7
2 As they were drinking wine, the king asked again, “Esther, what do you want me
to do for you? Tell me, and I will do it for you. Even if you ask me for half of my
kingdom, I will give it to you.”
3 Esther replied, “O king, if you are pleased with me, and if you are willing to do
what I ask, save me, and save my people. That is what I want you to do for me.
4 It is as though I and my people are cattle that have been sold to be slaughtered.
It is as though we have been sold to people who want to completely destroy us. If we
had only been sold to people to become their male and female slaves, I would not say
anything, because that would have been a matter too small to bother you, the king.”
5 Then King Xerxes asked her, “Who would want to do such a terrible thing? Where
is he?”
6 Esther replied, “The man who is our enemy is this evil man Haman!” Then Haman
7 The king became extremely angry. He immediately left his wine and got up and
to plead with Queen Esther that she would spare his life.
8 He threw himself down on the couch where Esther was reclining. But at that
moment the king returned from the garden to the room where they had been eating.
He saw Haman, and assumed he was preparing to rape Esther. He exclaimed, “Are
you going to rape the queen while she is here with me in my own palace?” As soon
as the king said that, some officials covered Haman’s head, as they did to people who
were about to be hanged.
9 Then Harbona, one of the king’s personal officials, said, “Outside, near Haman’s
house, there is a ◄gallows/set of poles for hanging someone►. It is 75 feet high.
Haman made it for Mordecai, the man who spared your life!” The king said, “Hang
him on it!”
10 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for hanging
Mordecai! And then ◄the king’s anger cooled off/the king was no longer so angry►.
8
The king issued a decree to save the Jews
1 Later on that same day, King Xerxes declared that everything that Haman, the
enemy of the Jews, owned, would now belong to Queen Esther. Esther told the king
that Mordecai was her cousin. When the king heard that, he sent a message to tell
Mordecai to come in.
2 When Mordecai came in, the king took off the ring that had his official seal on it,
the ring that he had previously given to Haman, and gave it to Mordecai, to indicate
that Mordecai was now his most important official. And Esther appointed Mordecai
to be in charge of everything that had belonged to Haman.
3 Esther again came to talk to the king. She prostrated herself at his feet, crying.
She wanted to plead for him to stop what Haman had planned, to kill all the Jews.
4 The king held out his gold scepter/staff toward Esther, so Esther arose and stood
in front of him.
5 She said, “Your majesty, if you are pleased with me, and if you think that it is the
right thing to do, make a new law to cancel what Haman decreed, that all the Jews
in all the provinces in your empire should be killed.
6 I cannot bear seeing all my family and all the rest of my people killed.”
7 King Xerxes replied to Queen Esther and Mordecai, “Because Haman tried to get
rid of all the Jews, I have given to Esther everything that belonged to Haman, and I
have ordered my soldiers to hang Haman.
Esther 8:8
720
Esther 9:6
8 So now I am also permitting you to write other letters, to save your people. You
may put my name on the letters, and use my ring to seal them because no letter that
has my name on it and which is sealed with my ring can ever be changed.”
9 Then the king summoned his secretaries, on June 25th, and Mordecai told them to
write letters to the Jews and to all the governors and other officials in all of the 127
provinces, which extended from India in the east to Ethiopia in the west. They wrote
these letters in all the languages that the people in each area spoke. They also wrote
10-11 They wrote in those letters that the Jews in every city were permitted by the
group of soldiers who attacked them. They were also permitted to kill the women
and children of those who attacked them, and to take the possessions of the people
whom they killed.
12 All this was to be done on March 7th of the following year. Mordecai signed the
king’s name on the letters, and sealed them with the seal that was on the king’s ring.
Then he gave them to messengers, who rode on fast horses that had been raised
especially for the king.
13 Copies of this law were to be nailed to posts in every province and read to all
the people, in order that the Jews would be ready to ◄get revenge on/fight against►
their enemies on March 7th.
14 The king commanded the men who took these letters to all the provinces to ride
quickly on the king’s horses. And copies of the letter were also posted and read to
the people in the capital city, Susa.
15 Before Mordecai left the palace, he put on the blue and white robe and a large
gold crown that the king had given him. He also put on a coat made of fine purple
cloth. When the people in Susa heard the new law, they all shouted and cheered.
16 The Jews in Susa were very happy, and other people honored them.
17 And when the new law arrived in every city and province, the Jews there
celebrated and prepared feasts and were very joyful. And many men throughout the
empire were circumcised and became Jews, because they were now afraid of what the
Jews would do to them if they were not Jews.
9
1 The first law that the king had commanded was to be made effective on March
7th. On that day the enemies of the Jews hoped to get rid of them. But instead, on
that same day the Jews defeated their enemies.
2 Throughout the empire, the Jews gathered together in their cities to attack those
who wanted to get rid of them. No one could fight against the Jews, because all the
other people in the areas where the Jews lived were afraid of them, so they did not
want to help anyone who attacked the Jews.
3 All the governors and other officials and important people in all the provinces
helped the Jews, because they were afraid of Mordecai.
4 They were afraid of him because in all the provinces they knew that Mordecai
was now the king’s most important official, with the authority that Haman previously
had. Mordecai was becoming more famous because the king was giving him more
and more power.
5 On March 7th, the Jews attacked and killed with their swords all of their enemies.
They did whatever they wanted to do, to the people who hated them.
6 Just in Susa alone, the capital city, they killed 500 people.
Esther 9:7
721
7 Among those whom they killed were the ten sons of Haman.
Esther 9:26
Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
9 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha.
Jews. The Jews killed them, but they did not take the things that belonged to the
people whom they killed.
11 At the end of that day someone reported to the king the number of people whom
the Jews killed in Susa.
12 Then the king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have killed 500 people here in
Susa, including the ten sons of Haman! So I think that they must have killed many
more people in the rest of my empire [RHQ]! But okay, now what else do you want
me to do for you. You tell me, and I will do it.”
13 Esther replied, “If it pleases you, allow the Jews here in Susa to do again tomorrow
what you commanded them to do today. And command that the bodies of Haman’s
ten sons be hanged on the gallows/poles.”
14 So the king commanded that the Jews be permitted to kill more of their enemies
the next day. After he issued another order in Susa, the bodies of Haman’s ten sons
were hanged.
15 On the next day, the Jews in Susa gathered together and killed 300 more people.
But again, they did not take the things that belonged to the people whom they killed.
16 That happened on March 8th. On the following day, the Jews in Susa rested and
celebrated. In all the other provinces, the Jewish people gathered together to defend
themselves, and they killed 75,000 people who hated them, but again they did not
take the things that belonged to the people whom they killed.
17 That occurred on March 7th, and on the following day they rested and celebrated.
18 After the Jews in Susa gathered together and killed their enemies on March 7th
and 8th, they rested and celebrated on March 9th.
19 That is why every year, on March 8th, the Jews who live in villages now celebrate
defeating their enemies. They have feasts and give gifts of food to each other.
20 Mordecai wrote down all the things that had happened. Then he sent letters to
the Jews who lived throughout the empire of King Xerxes.
21 He told them that every year they should celebrate on the 8th and 9th of March,
22 because those were the days when the Jews got rid of their enemies. He also told
them that they should celebrate on those days by feasting and giving gifts of food to
each other and to poor people. They would remember it as the month in which they
changed from being very sorrowful to being very joyful, from crying to celebrating.
23 So the Jews agreed to do what Mordecai wrote. They agreed to celebrate on those
days every year.
24 They would remember how Haman, son of Hammedatha, a descendant of King
Agag, became an enemy of all the Jews. They would remember how he had made an
evil plan to kill the Jews, and that he had ◄cast lots/thrown small marked stones► to
choose the day to kill [DOU] them.
25 They would remember that when Esther told the king about Haman’s plan, the
that he would be killed instead of the Jews, and that Haman and that his sons were
26 Because the ◄lot/small marked stone► that Haman threw was called Pur, the
was written► in that letter, and because of all that happened to them,
Esther 9:27
722
Esther 10:3
27 the Jews throughout the empire agreed to celebrate in that manner on those two
days every year. They said that they would tell their descendants and those people
celebrate just as Mordecai told them to do in the letter that he wrote.
in each family, in every city, and in every province. They solemnly declared that they
called Purim.
29 Then Mordecai and Queen Esther, who was the daughter of Abihail, wrote a
second letter about the Purim feast. Esther used the authority that she had because
of being the queen to confirm that what Mordecai had written in the first letter was
true.
30-31 What they wrote in the second letter was, “We wish that all of you will be living
peacefully and safely/righteously. We want you and your descendants to celebrate
Purim each year on the days that we two established, and to do the things that we two
told you to do.” In that letter, Queen Esther and Mordecai also gave them instructions
about ◄fasting/abstaining from eating food► and being sorrowful. Then copies of that
letter were sent to all the Jews who were living in the 127 provinces of the empire.
32 The letter that Esther wrote about the manner in which they should celebrate
the Purim feast was also written in an official record.
10
1 King Xerxes required that all the people in his empire pay taxes. Even the people
who lived on the islands in the Mediterranean Sea (OR, in coastal areas) were required
to pay taxes.
2 And all the great and powerful things that Xerxes did were written in the scroll
called/entitled ‘The record of the things done by the kings of Media and Persia’. In
this book were also written the things done by Mordecai, the man whom the king had
greatly honored.
3 Mordecai, who was a Jew, became the king’s most important official, and all the
Jews also considered him to be a very great man. They all respected him, because he
did many good things for the Jews, and he often asked the king to do good things for
them.
JOB 1:1
723
JOB 1:16
This book contains the account of the intense suffering of
Job and of God restoring him. We call this book
Job
Job and his family
1 In the land named Uz, there was a man named Job. He was a very godly/righteous
[DOU] man, who greatly respected/revered God and always avoided doing evil things.
2 He had seven sons and three daughters.
3 He owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 1,000 oxen, and 500 female donkeys. He also
had many servants. He was the richest man in all the area east of the Jordan River.
4 Each year, Job’s sons made feasts in their houses to celebrate their birthdays.
Whenever each one made a feast, he would invite all his brothers and his three sisters
5 When each celebration ended, Job would summon them. He would get up early
each of his children. He said to himself, “Perhaps one of my sons has sinned and said
something evil about God in his heart.”
Satan wanted to test Job
6 One day, the angels came and gathered together in front of Yahweh, and Satan
came too.
7 Yahweh asked Satan, “Where have you come from?”
Satan replied, “I have come from the earth, where I been traveling back and forth,
seeing what is happening.”
8 Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you ◄noticed/thought about► my faithful servant
Job? He is very godly/righteous [DOU], he greatly respects/reveres me, and he always
avoids doing evil things. There is no one else on the earth like him.”
9 Satan replied to Yahweh, “What you say is true, but Job greatly respects you only
because of what you have done for him [RHQ].
10 You have always [RHQ] protected [MET] him and his family and everything that
he owns. You have made him very prosperous/rich. He has livestock all over this
land.
11 But if you take away [MTY] everything that he has, he will curse you openly.
[IDM]”
12 Yahweh replied to Satan, “◄All right/Okay►, I will permit you to take away
everything that he has. But do not harm him.”
Then Satan left, and he prepared to cause many disastrous things to happen to Job.
13 One day after that, Job’s sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at
the home of their oldest brother.
14 While they were doing that, a messenger arrived at Job’s home and said to him,
“While your oxen were plowing the fields and the donkeys were grazing nearby,
15 a group of men from the Sheba area came and attacked us. They killed all your
servants who were working in the fields and took away all the oxen and donkeys! I
am the only one who escaped to come and tell you what happened.”
16 While he was still talking to Job, another messenger arrived. He said to Job,
“Lightning from the sky [MTY] struck and killed all the sheep and all the men who
were taking care of the sheep! I am the only one who escaped to come and tell you
what happened.”
JOB 1:17
724
JOB 2:11
17 While he was still talking to Job, another messenger arrived.
He said to Job,
“Three groups of robbers/bandits from Chaldea land came and attacked us. They
stole all the camels and killed all the men who were taking care of them. I am the
only one who escaped to come and tell you what happened.”
18 While he was still talking to Job, another messenger arrived and reported this to
Job: “Your sons and daughters were feasting in the home of their oldest brother.
19 Suddenly a ◄very strong wind/tornado► came from the desert and struck the
only one who escaped to come and tell you what happened.”
grieved. Then he prostrated himself on the ground to worship God.
“When I was born, I had no clothes on.
Yahweh gave me everything that I possessed,
and now he has taken it all away.
But ◄we should/I will► always praise Yahweh anyway! [MTY]”
22 In spite of all these things that happened to Job, he did not sin by saying that
what God had done was wrong.
Satan wanted to test Job again
2
1 On another day, the angels came again and gathered together in front of Yahweh,
and Satan came too.
2 Yahweh asked Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan replied, “I have
come from the earth, where I have been traveling back and forth, seeing what is
happening.”
3 Yahweh asked Satan, “Have you ◄noticed/thought about► my faithful servant Job?
He is very godly/righteous [DOU], he greatly respects/reveres me, and he always
avoids doing evil things. And he still acts in a very godly/righteous manner, even
though you persuaded me to let you cause disastrous things to happen to him for no
reason.”
4 Satan replied to Yahweh, “He praises you only because you bless him [IDM]. People
will give up everything they have to save their own lives.
5 But if you harm his body [MTY], he will surely curse you openly [IDM]!”
6 Yahweh replied to Satan, “◄All right/Okay►, you may do to him whatever you
want to do, but do not cause him to die.”
7 So Satan left, and he caused Job to be afflicted with very painful boils, from the
top of his head to the soles of his feet.
8 Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped the boils on his skin, and he sat in
ashes as people did when they were mourning for those who had died.
9 His wife said to him, “Are you still trying to ◄be loyal to/faithfully trust in► God?
You should curse God, and then you will die.”
10 But Job replied, “You talk like people who do not know God talk. ◄Should we
accept only the good things that God does for us?/We should not accept only the good
things that God does for us.► [RHQ] We should also accept bad things.” So in spite of
all these things that happened to Job, he did not say anything against God.
Job’s three friends came to comfort him
11 Among Job’s friends were Eliphaz from Teman town, Bildad from Shuah land
and Zophar from Naamah land. When they heard about all the terrible things that
JOB 2:12
725
JOB 3:17
had happened to Job, they left their home areas and went together to Job to console/
comfort him [DOU].
12 When they saw Job from a distance, they almost did not recognize him. They
wailed loudly, they tore their robes, and they threw dust over their heads to show
how sorry they were because of what had happened to Job.
to Job, because they saw that he was suffering greatly, and they did not think that
Job spoke
3
1 Finally, Job spoke, and he cursed the day that he was born.
2 He said,
3 “I wish that the day when I was born could be eradicated,
and also the night when I was conceived.
4 I wish that the day when I was born would have been covered in darkness.
I wish that God who is in heaven [MTY] would have forgotten about that day,
and that the sun would not have shone on it.
5 I wish that thick/intense darkness would have filled that day,
and that a black cloud would have come over it
and blotted out all light
and caused people to be terrified.
6 I wish that the night when I was conceived would be erased from the calendar,
with the result that it would never again appear as one night in any month,
and that it would not be included in any calendar.
7 I wish that no child would again be conceived on that night of the month [MET],
and that no one would again be happy on that night.
8 I want those people who ◄curse/put evil spells on► days—those who know how to
arouse/awaken the great sea monster—to curse that day.
9 I wish that the stars that shone early in the morning on that day after I was conceived
will not shine again.
I want those stars to have wished in vain for light to shine;
and that they would not have shone on that day.
10 That was an evil day because my mother was able to conceive;
instead, I was born, and I have now experienced all these terrible things.
11 “I wish that I had died [RHQ] when I was born—
at the time I emerged from my mother’s womb.
12 I wish that my mother had not [RHQ] allowed me to live.
I wish that she had not nursed me.
13 If I had died at the time when I was born,
I would be asleep, resting peacefully iin the place where the dead people are.
14 I would be resting with kings whose beautiful palaces that they built are now in
ruins (OR, who rebuilt palaces that had previously been destroyed),
and I would be resting with their officials who have also died.
15 I would be resting with princes who were wealthy,
whose palaces were filled with gold and silver.
16 I wish that I had been buried like a child who died in its mother’s womb
and never lived to see the light.
those who are very tired now will rest.
JOB 3:18
726
JOB 4:10
18 Those who were in prison rest peacefully after they die;
they no longer have slave-drivers who curse them.
19 Rich people and poor people are alike after they die,
and those who were slaves are no longer controlled by their masters.
20 ◄“Why does God allow those who are suffering greatly like me to continue to remain
alive?/I do not understand why God allows those who are suffering greatly like
me to continue to remain alive.► [RHQ]
Why does he allow those who are very miserable/distressed to keep living [RHQ]?
21 They long/want to die, but they do not die.
They desire to die more than people desire to find a hidden treasure.
22 When they finally die and are buried, they are very happy.
23 Those who do not know where they are eventually going when they die [RHQ],
people whom God has forced [MET] to continue to live in misery,
◄it is not right that they continue to live./why do they continue to live?► [RHQ]
24 I continually cry very much; as a result, I cannot eat;
and I can never stop groaning.
25 Things that I always worried might happen to me, have happened to me;
things that I always dreaded have happened to me.
26 Now I have no peace in my inner being,
I have no peace;
I cannot rest;
instead, I have only troubles.”
Eliphaz replied to Job
4
1 Then Eliphaz, from Teman, replied to Job. He said,
2 “Will you please let me say something to you?
I am not [RHQ] able to remain silent any longer.
3 In the past, you have instructed/taught many people,
and you have encouraged those who were weak.
4 By what you said, you have helped those who ◄needed spiritual help/almost quit
trusting in God► [MET],
and you have enabled them to become spiritually strong again [MET].
5 But now, when you experience disasters, you become discouraged.
6 You revere God; ◄does that not cause you to trust in him?/that should cause you to
If you were guiltless, you would [RHQ] be confident that God would not have
7 Think about this: Do innocent people die while they are still young [RHQ]?
Does God get rid of godly people [RHQ]? No!
8 What I have experienced is this: Just as [MET] farmers who plant bad seeds do not
harvest good crops,
just as those who start trouble for others, later bring trouble on themselves.
9 They die when God angrily blows his breath on them,
when he is very angry with them.
10 Even though wicked people may be very powerful like young lions,
God will get rid of them [MET].
JOB 4:11
727
JOB 5:7
11 They will die like fierce lions that starve to death when there are no animals that
they can kill and eat,
and their children will be separated from each other like young lions separate from
each other to find food.”
Eliphaz says that he learned a secret
12 “I heard a message that someone came
and whispered to me.
13 He spoke to me at night when I was having a bad dream that disturbed/frightened
me
while I was fast asleep.
14 It caused me to be afraid and tremble;
it caused all my bones to shake.
15 A ghost glided past my face
and caused the hair on on the back of my neck to stand straight up.
16 It stopped, but I could not see what form it had.
But I could sense that there was some being in front of me,
and it said in a quiet voice,
17 ‘◄Does God consider anyone to be righteous?/No human beings can be righteous
in God’s sight!► [RHQ]
◄Their creator cannot consider them to be pure./Can their creator consider them to
be pure?► [RHQ]
18 God cannot be sure that his own angels will always do what is right;
he declares that some of them have done what is wrong.
19 So he certainly cannot trust human beings who were made from dust and clay,
who are crushed as easily as moths are crushed!
20 People are sometimes well in the morning, but in the evening they are dead.
They are gone forever and do not even know it (OR, and no one pays any attention
21 They are like [MET] tents that collapse suddenly:
Eliphaz continued replying to Job
1 “Job, it is okay that you continue to cry out for someone to help you,
but I am certain that [RHQ] no angel will come to help you!
2 Foolish people die because of being ◄resentful/very angry at someone►;
people who are easily deceived are destroyed by their being jealous of others.
3 I have seen foolish people who seemed to be successful/prosperous,
but suddenly they experienced disaster/ trouble because someone cursed their
home.
4 Their sons are never safe;
they ◄lose their case/are condemned► when someone ◄takes them to court/sues
them►,
because there is no one to defend them.
5 Hungry people steal the crops that foolish people harvest, and eat those crops;
they even steal the crops that grow among thorns,
and greedy people take away the wealth of foolish people.
6 But evil circumstances/sufferings are not produced by the soil;
troubles do not grow up from the ground.
7 People have troubles from the time that they are born
JOB 5:8
728
JOB 5:27
just as surely as sparks shoot up from a fire.
8 “If I were suffering like you are, I would ask God for help
and tell him ◄what I am complaining about/about my suffering►.
9 He does great things, things that we cannot understand;
we cannot even count the marvelous things that he does.
10 He sends rain on the ground;
he sends water on our fields.
11 He exalts those who are humble,
and causes those who mourn to be joyful (OR, safe, prosperous).
12 He causes crafty/cunning people to not be able to do what they plan to do,
with the result that they achieve nothing.
13 He causes people who think that they [IRO] are wise to be trapped by the cunning
with the result that they do not succeed.
and grope around trying to find the road at noontime like people do at night.
15 But God saves helpless people from being harmed by what wicked people say [MTY],
he saves needy people from being injured by [MTY] powerful people.
16 So, poor people confidently expect that good things will happen to them
but God causes wicked people to stop talking.
17 “But those whom God corrects/rebukes are happy;
so do not despise/dislike it when God who is all-powerful disciplines you.
18 He wounds people, but then he puts bandages on those wounds;
he hurts people, but he [SYN] also heals them.
19 He will rescue you many times from your troubles,
with the result that nothing evil will happen to you.
20 When there is a famine, he will not allow you to die,
and when there is a war, you will not be killed [MTY].
21 God will protect you when people slander [MTY] you;
you will not be afraid when many things around you are destroyed.
22 You will be able to laugh/scoff when things are destroyed and when there is famine,
and you will not be afraid of wild animals.
23 You will not worry about having big rocks in your fields that will make plowing
difficult,
and you will not worry about being attacked by wild animals there.
24 In your tent, you will know that things will go well for you,
and when you look at your livestock, you will see that ◄they are all there/none
of them is missing►.
25 You will be sure that you will have many descendants,
who will be as numerous as blades of grass.
26 You will become very old before you die,
like sheaves of grain continue to grow until it is time to harvest them.
27 “My friends and I have thought carefully about these things, and we know that they
are true,
so pay attention to what I have said!”
JOB 6:1
Job refuted Eliphaz’ claim
729
JOB 6:19
3 they would be heavier than all the sands on the shores of the oceans.
That is why I spoke ◄very rashly/without thinking clearly► about the day that I
was born.
4 It is as though Almighty God has shot me with arrows.
It is as though those arrows had poison on their tips, and that poison has gone
into my spirit.
The things that God has done to me have terrified me.
5 Just like a wild donkey does not complain by braying when it has plenty of grass to
eat,
and an ox does not complain by bellowing when it has food to eat [MET],
I would not complain if you were really helping/comforting me.
6 People complain [RHQ] when they must eat food which has no salt
and that is what your words are like, Eliphaz.
and I loathe/detests that kind of food [MET],
I do not appreciate what you have said to me.
8 “I wish that God would do for me what I have requested from him [DOU].
9 I wish that he would crush me and let me die.
I wish that he would reach out his hand and take away my life.
10 If he would do that, I would be comforted by knowing that in spite of the great
pain that I have suffered,
I have always obeyed what God, the Holy One, has commanded.
11 But now I do not have [RHQ] enough strength to endure all these things.
And since I have nothing to hope for in ◄the future/this life►,
it is difficult for me to be patient now [RHQ].
12 I am not [RHQ] strong like rocks are,
and my body is not made of bronze.
13 So I am not able to help myself,
and it seems that there is no one to rescue me.”
Job’s friends were not helping him
14 “When a man has many troubles, his friends should be kind to him,
even if he stops revering Almighty God.
15 But you, my friends, are not dependable.
You are like streams: They spill over their banks in the spring
16 when the melting ice and snow make those streams overflow,
17 but when the dry season comes, there is no water flowing in those streams,
and the channels dry up.
18 The caravans of merchants turn off the path to search for some water,
but there is no water,
so they die in the desert.
19 The men in those caravans search for some water
because they are sure that they will find some.
730
JOB 7:8
20 But they do not find any,
so they are very disappointed.
21 Similarly, you friends have not helped me at all!
You have seen that terrible things have happened to me,
and you are afraid that God might do similar things to you.
22 After I lost all my wealth, did I ask any of you for money? [RHQ]
Did I plead with any of you to spend some of your money to help me [RHQ]?
23 Have I asked any of you to rescue me from my enemies [RHQ]?
Have I asked you to save me from those who ◄oppressed me/treated me badly►
[RHQ]? No!”
Job insisted he had done no wrong
24 “Answer me now, and then I will be quiet;
tell me what wrong things I have done!
25 When people speak what is true, that will not hurt the person who hears it,
but what you say, criticizing me, is not true, so your saying it proves nothing
[RHQ]!
26 I am a man who has nothing to hope for,
but you try to correct me, and you think what I say is nothing but wind [RHQ]!
27 You do not sympathize with me at all for all that I am suffering.
You are heartless! You would even gamble to see who gets an orphan as a prize!
28 Please look at me! I will not [RHQ] lie to you.
29 Stop saying that I have sinned, and stop criticizing me unjustly!
You should realize that I have not done things that are wrong.
Job complains to God
1 “People need to work hard on this earth, like soldiers do;
all during the time that we are alive, we work hard [RHQ], like laborers/servants do.
2 We are like [SIM] slaves who keep wanting to be in the cool shade,
and we are like [SIM] workers who are waiting to be paid.
3 God has given me many months in which I think that it is useless to remain alive;
he has allotted/given to me many nights during which I feel miserable.
4 When I lie down at night I say, ‘How long will it be until morning?’
But nights are long, and I ◄toss/turn over and over► on my bed until dawn.
5 My body is covered with maggots and scabs;
pus oozes out of my open sores.
6 My days pass as quickly as a weaver’s ◄shuttle/stick that takes the thread back and
forth►,
and they end without my confidently expecting that things will be better the next
day.
7 God, do not forget that my life is as short as a breath [MET];
I think that I [SYN] will never again be happy.
8 God, you [SYN] see me now,
but some day you will not see me any more.
You will search for me, but I will be gone because I will be dead.
JOB 7:9
731
JOB 8:6
9 Like [SIM] clouds ◄disperse/break up► and then disappear,
people die and descend to the place where dead people are, and they do not
return;
10 they never return to their houses,
and people among whom they lived do not remember them any more.
11 So, I will not be silent;
while I am suffering I will speak;
I will complain to God about what has happened to me
because I [SYN] am very angry.
12 God, why do you watch closely what I am doing?
Do you think that I am a dangerous sea monster?
13 When I lie down at night, I think, ‘I will be comforted here on my bed;
my pain will be less while I am sleeping.’
14 But then you give me dreams that cause me to be afraid;
you give me visions that terrify me,
15 with the result that I would prefer to be strangled to death
than to continue to be alive being only a bunch of bones.
16 I detest continuing to be alive; I do not want to live for many years [HYP].
Allow me to be alone, because I will be alive for only a very short remaining time
[HYP].
17 “We human beings are not very important;
and examine us every moment to see if we are doing what is right.
19 ◄When will you stop looking at me and leave me alone for a little time, long enough
to swallow my spit?/Please stop looking at me and leave me alone for a little
time, long enough to swallow my spit.► [RHQ]
20 Why do you watch me constantly?
If I sin, that certainly does not harm you!
Why have you set me up like a target to shoot at?
Do you consider me to be a heavy load that you are forced to carry?
21 If I have sinned, are you not able to forgive me for my sins—
the things that I have done that are wrong?
Soon I will lie in my grave;
you will search for me, but you will not find me because I will be dead and gone.”
Bildad’s first speech to Job
8
1 Then Bildad, from the Shuah area, spoke to Job. He said,
2 “Job, how much longer will you talk like this?
What you say is only hot air.
3 Almighty God certainly never does [RHQ] what is unfair/unjust.
He always does [LIT] what is right/fair.
4 So, it is evident that your children have sinned against him,
therefore he has caused them to be punished for evil things that they have done.
5 But, if you will now earnestly request [DOU] Almighty God to help you,
6 and if you are pure and honest/righteous,
he will surely do something good for you
JOB 8:7
732
JOB 9:4
and reward you by giving your family back to you and enabling you to prosper.
7 And even though you think that you were not very prosperous/wealthy before,
during the last part of your life you will become very wealthy.
8 “I request you to think about what happened long ago
and consider what our ancestors found out.
our time here on the earth disappears quickly, like a shadow [MET].
Allow them to tell you from what they learned!
11 Papyrus can certainly not [RHQ] grow in places where there is no marsh/swamp;
reeds certainly cannot [RHQ] flourish/grow where there is no water.
12 If they do not have enough water, while they are still blossoming,
they wither more quickly than other plants wither.
13 Those who do not pay attention to what God says are like those reeds;
godless people stop confidently expecting that good things will happen to them.
14 The things they confidently expect to happen do not happen;
things they trust will help them are as fragile as [MET] a spider’s web.
15 If they lean against a house (OR, trust in their wealth; OR, lean on a spider web), it
does not ◄endure/protect them► [LIT];
they cling to things to be protected, but those things do not remain firm.
16 Godless people are like plants [MET] that are watered before the sun rises;
their shoots spread all over the gardens.
17 The roots of those plants twist around piles of stones
and cling tightly to rocks.
18 But if those plants are pulled out,
it is as though the place where they were planted says ‘They were never here!’
And that is what happens to wicked people who do not heed what God says.
19 Truly, evil people [MET] are not joyful [IRO] for a long time;
other people come and take their places.
20 :So, I tell you, Job, God will not reject you if you are truly godly/righteous,
but he does not help [IDM] evil people.
21 He will enable you [MTY] to continually laugh
and to always shout joyfully.
and prove it?’/no one can say to God ‘I <am innocent/have not done what is
wrong> and prove it.’► [RHQ]
God could ask him 1,000 questions,
and that person would not be able to answer any of them!
4 God is very wise [IDM] and very powerful;
JOB 9:5
733
JOB 9:24
no one who has tried to challenge God has been able to win.
5 He even moves mountains, without them (OR, anyone) knowing about it.
When he is angry, he turns them upside down.
6 He sends earthquakes that shake the ground;
he causes the pillars that support the earth to tremble.
7 Some days he speaks to the sun, and it does not rise,
and some nights he prevents the stars from shining.
he alone puts his feet on the waves (OR, on the huge sea monster).
9 He put in their places the clusters/groups of stars that are called The Dipper/Bear,
Orion, the Pleiades, and the stars in the southern sky.
10 Only he does great things that we cannot understand;
he does more marvelous things than we are able to count.
11 He passes by where I am, but I do not see him;
he moves further on, but I do not see him go.
12 If he wants to snatch something away, no one [RHQ] can hinder him;
no one dares to ask him, ‘Why are you doing that?’ [RHQ]
13 God will not very easily stop being angry;
he defeated [MTY] those who tried to help Rahab, the great sea monster.
what could I say [MTY] to answer him?
15 Even though I ◄would be innocent/would not have done what is wrong►, I would
not be able to answer him.
All I could do would be to request God, my judge/accuser, to act mercifully toward
me.
16 If I summoned him to come to the courtroom and he said that he would come,
I would not believe that he would pay attention to what I would say.
17 He sends storms to batter me,
and he bruises me many times ◄without any reason to do that/even though I am
innocent►.
18 It is as though he will not let me get/catch my breath,
because he causes me to suffer all the time.
19 If I would try to ◄wrestle with/fight against► him, there is no way that I could defeat
him,
because he is stronger than I am.
If I would request him to appear in court,
there is no one who could [RHQ] force him to go there.
20 Even though I was innocent, what I would say would cause him to say that I must
be punished [MTY];
even though I had not done anything wrong, he would prove that I am guilty.
21 “I have not done what is wrong, but that is not important.
I despise continuing to remain alive.
22 But it doesn’t matter,
because God will get rid of all of us, both those who are innocent and those who
are wicked.
23 When people experience disaster and it causes them to suddenly die,
God laughs at it, even if they are innocent.
24 God has allowed wicked people to control what happens in the world.
JOB 9:25
734
JOB 10:7
It is as though he has caused judges to be blindfolded, with the result that they
cannot judge fairly.
If it is not God who has put wicked people in control,
who has done it?
25 “My days go by very quickly, like a fast runner;
it is as though they run away, and nothing good happens to me on those days.
26 My life goes by very rapidly, like a boat made from reeds sailing swiftly,
because I know that God does not consider that I am innocent.
29 He will ◄condemn me/declare that I should be punished►,
so why should I keep trying in vain to defend myself?
30 If I washed myself with snow
or cleansed my hands with lye/soap
to get rid of my guilt,
31 he would still throw me into a filthy pit;
as a result it would be as though even my clothes would detest me.
32 “God is not a human, as I am,
so there is no way that I could answer him to prove that I am innocent
if we went together to have a trial in a courtroom.
33 There is no one to ◄mediate/hear us and decide who is right►,
no one who has authority over both of us [IDM].
34 I wish/desire that he would stop punishing [MTY] me,
and that he would not continue to terrify me.
35 If he did that, I would declare that I am innocent without being afraid of him,
because I know that I really have not done what is wrong like God thinks that I
have.”
10
Job again complained to God
1 “I am tired of living.
And I will not be silent and stop saying what I am complaining about.
Instead, being very unhappy, I will speak [IDM].
2 I will say to God, ‘Do not say that I must be punished;
instead, tell me what wrong you are saying that I have done.
3 Does it seem to be good for you to oppress me,
to abandon me, whom you created,
and instead, to help wicked people to do the things that they plan to do?
4 Do you understand things the way that we humans do?
5 ◄Do you live for only a few years, like we do?/You certainly do not live for only a
few years, like we do.► [RHQ]
6 So, why do you [RHQ] continue to search for my faults?
Why do you hunt for my sins?
7 You know that I am not guilty,
and that no one can rescue me from your power [MTY].
JOB 10:8
735
JOB 11:3
8 “'With your hands you created me and shaped/formed my body;
but now you are deciding that you should not have done that, and you are
9 Do not forget that you made me from a piece of clay;
are you going to cause me to become dirt again [RHQ]?
10 You certainly [RHQ] directed/controlled it when I was conceived,
and you formed me inside my mother’s womb [MET].
11 You fastened my bones together with sinews,
and then you covered them with flesh inside my skin.
12 You have caused me to be alive, and you have faithfully loved me,
and you have carefully ◄preserved me/kept me alive►.
13 “'But you ◄kept secret/did not reveal► what you were planning to do to me;
I am certain that you were planning to do these things to me.
14 You were watching to see if I would sin,
in order that if I sinned, you would refuse to forgive me.
15 If I am a wicked man, I hope/wish that terrible things will happen to me.
But even if I am righteous, I still must bow my head and feel ashamed,
because I am very disgraced and feel miserable.
16 And if I am proud, you hunt me like [SIM] a lion hunts for some animal to kill,
and you act powerfully to injure me.
17 You constantly find more witnesses to testify that I have done what is wrong,
and you continually become more angry/perturbed with me.
It is as though you are always bringing new troops to attack me.
18 “'God, why did you allow me to be born?
I wish/desire that I had died before anyone [SYN] saw me.
19 I consider that it would have been better if I had been carried directly from my
mother’s womb to the grave
than for me to live.
20 I think that [RHQ] there are only a few days for me to remain alive;
so ◄allow me to be alone/stop attacking me►, in order that I may be a little
cheerful
21 before I go to the place from which I will never return,
where it is always gloomy and very dark [DOU],
22 a place of darkness and dark shadows, where everything is confused/disordered,
where even a small amount of light there is like darkness (OR, there is no light,
only darkness).’ ”
11
Zophar’s first speech to Job
1 Then Zophar, from the Naamah area, said this to Job:
2 “◄Should no one answer all that you have said?/Someone should certainly answer
all that you have said.► [RHQ]
Just because you talk a lot, ◄should that cause us to declare that you <are
you <are innocent/have done nothing wrong>.► [RHQ]
not cause us to be silent.► [RHQ]
JOB 11:4
736
JOB 11:20
4 You say, ‘What I say is true;
God knows that I am ◄innocent/without guilt►.’
5 But I wish/desire that God would talk
and say something [MTY] to answer you!
6 God knows everything about everything,
so I wish/desire that he would tell you the secrets that he knows because he is
wise.
But you need to know that God is punishing you less than you deserve!
7 “Tell me, will you ever be able to find out the things about God that are very difficult
to understand?
Will you be able to find out everything that there is to know about Almighty God?
8 What there is to know about God is greater than the distance from earth to heaven;
It is greater than the distance from here to the place of the dead;
so it is impossible for you [RHQ] to know it all.
9 What there is to know about God is wider than the earth
and wider than the ocean.
10 “If God comes to you and puts you in prison and then brings you to a court,
◄who can stop him?/no one can stop him.► [RHQ]
11 He knows which people are worthless;
and when he sees people doing wicked things, ◄will he ignore it?/he will certainly
not ignore it!► [RHQ]
12 Stupid people like you will start to become wise [SAR]
when wild donkeys stop giving birth to wild donkeys and start giving birth to tame
donkeys.
13 “Job, repent [IDM];
reach out your hands to seek God’s help.
14 If you have done evil things, stop doing them;
and do not allow any people in your house to do wicked things.
you will be strong, and not afraid of anything.
they will be like the water of a flood that has all disappeared.
17 Your troubles will be ended, like the darkness ends at the dawn;
it will be as though [MET] the sun is shining brightly on you, like it shines at noon.
18 You will feel safe/secure, because you will confidently expect that good things will
happen to you;
God will protect you and enable you to rest safely each night.
19 You will lie down, and no one will cause you to be afraid.
And many people will come and request you to do things for them.
20 But wicked people [SYN] will not be able to understand why bad things are
happening to them;
they will not have any way to escape from their troubles.
The only thing that they will want to do is to die. [EUP]”
Job replied to his three friends
12
JOB 12:1
737
JOB 12:20
1 Then Job said to his three friends,
2 “You ◄talk as though/You think► [SAR] that you are the people whom everyone
should listen to,
and that when you die, there will be no more wise people.
3 But I have as much good sense as you do;
I am ◄not less wise than/certainly as wise as [LIT]► you.
Certainly everyone knows [RHQ] all that you have said.
4 My friends all laugh at me now.
Previously I habitually requested God to help me, and he answered/helped me.
I am righteous, a very godly man [DOU], but everyone laughs at me.
5 Those like you who have no troubles make fun of me;
they cause those like me who are already suffering to have more troubles.
6 Bandits live peacefully,
and no one threatens those who cause God to become angry;
their own strength is the god that they worship.
7 “But ask the wild animals what they know about God,
and if they could speak they would teach you.
If you could ask the birds,
they would tell you.
8 If you could ask the creatures that crawl on the ground, or the fish in the sea,
they would tell you about God.
9 All of them certainly know [RHQ] that it is Yahweh who has made them with his
hands.
10 He directs the lives of all living creatures;
he gives breath to all us humans to enable us to remain alive.
11 And when we [SYN] hear what other people like you say,
is bad,
12 Old people are often very wise,
13 but God is wise and very powerful;
he has good sense and understands everything.
14 If he tears something down, no one can rebuild it;
if he puts someone in prison, no one can open the prison doors to allow that
person to escape.
15 When he prevents rain from falling, everything dries up.
When he causes a lot of rain to fall, the result is that there are floods.
16 He is the one who is truly strong and wise;
he rules over those who deceive others and those whom they deceive.
17 He sometimes causes the king’s officials to no longer be wise,
and he causes judges to become foolish.
18 He takes from kings the robes that they wear
and puts loincloths around their waists, causing them to become slaves.
19 He takes from priests the sacred clothes that they wear, with the result that they no
longer can do their work,
and takes power from those who rule others.
20 He sometimes causes those whom others trust to be unable to speak,
and he causes old men to no longer have good sense.
JOB 12:21
738
JOB 13:16
21 He causes those who have authority to be despised,
and he causes those who are powerful to no longer have any power/strength.
22 He causes things that are hidden in the darkness to be revealed.
23 He causes some nations to become very great,
and later he destroys them;
he causes the territory of some nations to become much larger,
and later he causes them to be defeated and their people to be scattered.
24 He causes some rulers to become foolish/stupid,
and then he causes them to wander around, lost, in an barren desert.
25 They grope around in the darkness, without any light,
and he causes them to stagger like [SIM] people who are drunk.”
Job continued his reply
13
1 “Hey, I [SYN] have seen everything that you have seen,
and I have heard and understood all that you have said.
2 What you know, I also know;
I do ◄not know less than/know as much as► you.
3 But I would like to speak to Almighty God, not to you;
I would like to argue with him and prove that I ◄am innocent/have not done things
4 As for you, you do not allow people to know the truth about me,
like someone covers up a bad surface of a wall with whitewash [MET].
You are all like doctors [MET] that give people useless medicines.
5 I wish/desire that you would be silent;
that would be the wisest thing that you could do.
6 Listen to what I will say to you now;
listen while I am saying what is true about myself.
7 Are you telling lies about me to prove God is just in causing me to suffer?
Are you saying what is deceitful in order to benefit him?
8 Are you trying to defend him?
Are you trying to prove as you would in a court that he is innocent?
9 If he looks closely, will he find that everything that you have done is good?
Or can you deceive him, like you deceive other people?
10 If you secretly say/do things to cause God to act favorably toward you,
he will surely rebuke you.
11 He will certainly [RHQ] cause you to be terrified by his power/greatness;
you will become extremely afraid.
12 The things that you say that you think are wise are as useless as [MET] as ashes;
what you say to defend your opinions is no better than [MET] clay that quickly
crumbles.
13 “So, be quiet and allow me to speak,
and then it will not matter what happens to me.
14 I am ready to endure anything;
I am even willing to risk being executed [IDM, DOU] for what I will say.
15 If God kills me, then I will not have anyone else whom I can confidently expect to
help me,
but I am going to defend my behavior in his presence anyway.
16 No wicked/godless person would dare to stand in the presence of God,
JOB 13:17
739
JOB 14:6
but because I say that I have not done things that are wrong,
perhaps, if I can prove that to God, he will save me.”
Job asks God to tell him what his charges are
17 “God, listen very carefully to what I say [DOU].
18 I am ready to prove that I am innocent,
and I know that you also will declare that I am not guilty.
if anyone did that, I would ◄be silent/stop talking► and die.
20 “I am requesting you to do two things for me;
if you do them, I will ◄not hide from you/come and stand in front of you► [LIT].
21 The first thing that I request is that you stop punishing [IDM] me;
and the second thing that I request is that you stop causing me to be very terrified.
22 You speak first, and then I will reply;
or allow me to speak first, and then you reply.
23 What have I done that is wrong? What sins have I committed?
Show me how I have disobeyed you.
24 Why ◄do you refuse to be friendly with/have you abandoned► me [IDM]?
Why do you ◄act toward me as though I am/consider me to be► your enemy?
25 I am as insignificant as [MET] a leaf that is blown by the wind;
why are you trying to cause me to be afraid [RHQ]?
Why are you pursuing me?
Am I useless, nothing more than a bit of dry chaff [RHQ]?
26 It seems that you are writing things to accuse me of doing things that are wrong,
even recalling bad things that I did when I was young.
27 It is as though you have fastened my feet with chains to prevent me from walking,
and you watch me wherever I walk;
It is as though you even look closely at my footprints to see where I have gone.
28 As a result, my body is decaying like [SIM] rotten wood,
like a piece of cloth that is eaten by larvae of moths.”
14
Job prayed to God
1 “We humans are very frail.
We live only a short time, and we experience a lot of trouble.
2 We disappear quickly, like flowers that grow from the ground quickly and then
wither and die [SIM].
We are like shadows that disappear when the sun stops shining.
3 Yahweh, why do you keep watching me to see if I am doing something that is wrong
[RHQ]?
Are you wanting to take me to court to judge me?
4 People are sinners from the time when they are born;
who can cause them to be sinless? No one [RHQ]!
5 You have decided how long our lives will be.
You have decided how many months we will live,
and we cannot live more months than the ◄limit/number of months► that you
have decided.
6 So please stop examining us, and allow us to be alone,
JOB 14:7
740
JOB 15:1
until/while we finish our time here on earth, like a man finishes his work at the
end of the day.
Job said that we all die
7 If someone cuts a tree down,
we hope that it will sprout again and grow new branches.
8 Its roots in the ground may be very old,
and its stump may decay,
9 but if some water falls on it,
it may bud/sprout and send up shoots like a young plant.
10 But when we people lose all our strength and die,
we stop breathing and then we are gone forever.
11 Just like water evaporates from the ocean,
or like a riverbed dries up,
12 people lie down and die and do not get up again.
Until the heavens disappear,
people who die [EUP] do not wake up,
and no one can wake them up.
13 “Yahweh, I wish that you would put me safely in the place of the dead and forget
about me
until you are no longer angry with me.
I wish that you would decide how much time I would spend there,
and then remember that I am there.
14 When we humans die, we will certainly not live again [RHQ].
If I knew that we would live again, I would wait patiently,
and I would wait for you to release me from my sufferings.
15 You would call me, and I would answer.
You would be eager to see me, one of the creatures that you had made.
16 You would take care of [MET] me,
instead of watching me to see if I would sin.
17 It is as though the record of my sins would be sealed in a small bag,
and you would cover them up.
18 “But, just like mountains crumble and rocks fall down from a cliff,
19 and just like water slowly wears away the stones, and just like floods wash away
soil,
expect► that we will keep on living.
20 You always defeat us, and then we die [EUP].
You cause our faces to look ugly after we die,
and you send us away.
21 When we die we do not know if our sons will grow up and do things that will cause
them to be honored.
And if they become disgraced, we do not see that, either.
22 We will feel our own pains; we will not feel anything else;
we will be sorry for ourselves, not for anyone else.”
15
Eliphaz rebuked Job again
1 Then Eliphaz replied to Job:
JOB 15:2
741
JOB 15:21
2 “If you were truly wise [RHQ], you would not have replied to us by claiming that
you know a lot;
what you are saying is just a lot of hot air [MET].
3 You should not [RHQ] be saying things that do not benefit anyone,
4 By what you say, you show that you do not revere God,
5 It is as though your sins are telling you what to say;
6 Everything that you say [MTY] shows that you should be punished;
so, it is not necessary for me to show that.
7 “Tell me do you know more than everyone else because you think that you are the
first person who was ever born? [SAR, RHQ]
Were you born before the hills were created?
8 Were you listening when God made all his plans? [SAR, RHQ]
Or do you think that you are the only person who is wise?
9 ◄What do you know that we do not know?/You do not know anything that we do
not know.► [RHQ]
You do not understand [RHQ] anything that is not also clear to us.
10 My friends and I are also wise;
we acquired wisdom from old gray-haired people,
from people who were born before your father was born.
11 God wants to comfort you,
and to speak gently/kindly to you;
◄is that not enough for you/do you need more than that►?
12 Why do you allow yourself to be ◄carried away/excited► by your emotions?
Why are you very angry, with the result that your eyes flash?
13 You are angry [IDM] with God,
and so you [MTY] are criticizing/denouncing him.
14 “◄How can any person, including you, be sinless?/No person, including you, can be
sinless.► [RHQ]
◄How can anyone on the earth be completely righteous?/No one on the earth can
be completely righteous.► [RHQ]
15 Hey, God does not even trust his angels;
he does not consider even them to be completely pure.
16 So, he certainly does not trust abominable/disgusting and depraved/corrupt people
who do evil things as easily as they drink water [MET].
17 Job, listen to what I will tell you.
I will declare to you what I know,
18 things that wise men have told me,
no one from another country caused them to think wrongly [IDM].
20 It is wicked people who suffer with great pain all the time that they are alive;
that is what happens to those who ◄oppress/act violently toward► others.
21 They constantly hear sounds that terrify them;
while they are prospering, bandits attack them.
22 Wicked people surely know that they will not escape from darkness/death,
because they are sure that someone is waiting to kill them with a sword.
23 They wander around, searching for food, saying ‘Where can I find some?’
And they know that they will soon experience disasters.
24 Because they are afraid of those things happening to them, they are afraid and
worry
that these things will come to them like the army of a king comes to attack their
enemies and cause them to suffer [SIM].
25 Those things happen to them because they ◄shook their fists/dared to fight► against
Almighty God,
and thought that they were strong enough to defeat him.
26 They stubbornly [IDM] rush to attack God
as though they were carrying a strong shield to protect themselves.
27 They are so fat that they are unable to fight.
28 They will live in cities that have been abandoned,
cities which have become a heap of ruins.
29 But they will not remain rich very long;
Everything that they own will be taken from them;
their possessions will all disappear.
30 They will not escape from the darkness of death;
they will be like trees whose branches are burned by fire
and whose blossoms are blown away by the wind.
31 Since they are very foolish, with the result that they trust in things that are really
worthless,
then things that are worthless will be all that they get.
32 Before they are old, they will wither;
they will be like [MET] branches that wither and never become green again.
33 They will be like [SIM] vines whose grapes fall off before they are ripe,
like olive trees whose blossoms fall off before they produce any fruit.
34 Wicked/godless people will not have any descendants,
and fires will completely burn up the homes of those who built those homes using
money they received from bribes.
35 They plan to cause trouble and to do evil things,
and they are always preparing to deceive people.”
Job replied to the three friends again
16
1 Job replied to Eliphaz and the others:
2 “I have heard things like that before;
all of you, instead of helping me, are only causing me to feel more miserable.
3 Will your speeches, which are only hot air, never end [RHQ]?
I could say the things that you are saying;
I could make great speeches to criticize/condemn you,
and I could shake my head at you to ridicule you.
5 But, unlike all of you, with what I said [MTY] I would encourage you
and try to cause your pain to be less.
6 “But now, if I talk, my pain does not decrease,
JOB 16:7
743
JOB 17:1
and if I am silent, my pain still certainly does not [RHQ] go away.
7 God has now taken away all my strength,
and he has destroyed my family.
8 He has shriveled me up,
and people think that shows that I am a sinner.
And people see that I am only skin and bones,
and they think that proves that I am guilty.
9 Because God is very angry with me and hates me,
it is as though he is a wild animal that [MET] has gnashed his teeth at me
because he is my enemy.
10 People gape/stare at me with their mouths open to sneer at me;
they have struck me on the face/cheek to ridicule me,
and they crowd around me to threaten me.
11 It is as though God has handed me over to ungodly people
and turned me over to the wicked [DOU].
12 Previously, I was living peacefully,
but he crushed me;
it is as though he grabbed my neck and smashed me to pieces.
It is as though [MET] he set me up like a target;
13 people are surrounding me and shooting arrows at me.
His arrows pierce my kidneys
and cause the bile from my liver to spill onto the ground,
and God does not pity me at all.
14 It is as though [MET] I am a wall that he is breaking through;
he rushes at me like [SIM] a soldier attacking his enemies.
15 “Because I am mourning, I wear pieces of rough cloth that I have sewed together,
and I sit here in the dirt, very depressed/discouraged.
16 My face is red because I have cried very much,
and there are dark circles around my eyes.
17 All this has happened to me even though I have not acted violently toward anyone,
and I always pray sincerely/honestly to God.
18 When I die, I want the ground [APO] to act as though I had been murdered and cry
out against those who killed me,
and I do not want anyone to stop me while I am demanding that God act justly
toward me.
19 But even now, I know that there is someone in heaven who will testify for me,
and he will say that what I have done is right.
20 My three friends scorn/ridicule me,
but my eyes are full of tears while I cry out to God.
21 I pray that the one who knows what I have done would come to plead with God for
me
like people plead for their friends.
22 I say this because within a few years I will die;
I will walk along the roadto the grave from which I will never return.”
17
Job continued his reply
1 “My ◄life/time to live► is almost ended; I have no strength left;
JOB 17:2
744
JOB 17:16
my grave is waiting for me.
2 Those who are around me are making fun of me;
I [SYN] watch them while they ◄taunt/make fun of► me.”
Job pleads with God
3 “God, it is as though I am in prison;
please pay the money in order that I may be released,
because there is certainly no one else who will help me.
4 You have prevented my friends from understanding what is true about me;
do not allow them to triumph over me, saying that I have done things that are
wrong.
5 Our ancestors often said, ‘It often happens that when someone betrays his friends in
order to get some of their property,
so I desire/hope that will be true of these friends of mine who are lying about me.
they spit in my face to insult me.
7 ◄My sight has become dim/I cannot see well► because I am extremely sad,
and my arms and legs are very thin, with the result that they almost do not cast
[MET] a shadow.
8 Those who say that they are good/righteous are shocked when they see what has
happened to me,
and people who say that they ◄are innocent/have not done anything that is
wrong► say that I am wicked/godless and should be punished.
9 Those who claim that they are righteous will continue to do what they think is right,
and those who say they have not sinned will continue to become stronger.
10 “But even if all of those people came and stood in front of me,
I would not find anyone among them who is wise.
11 My ◄life/time to live► is almost ended; I have not been able to do the things that I
confidently expected to do;
I have not been able to accomplish anything that I [SYN] desired.
12 My friends do not know when it is night and when it is day;
when it is night, they claim that it is daylight;
when it is becoming dark, they claim it is becoming light.
13 If my home will be the place where dead people are,
where will I sleep in the darkness?
14 I may say to the grave, ‘You will be like a father to me,’
and say to the maggots that will eat my body, ‘You will be like a mother or younger
sisters to me because you will be where I will always be.’
15 But if I say those things, ◄will there be anything good that I can confidently expect
to happen to me?/there will be nothing good that I can confidently expect to
happen to me.► [RHQ]
◄Is there anyone who knows anything good that I can expect when I am in the
grave?/No one knows anything good that I can expect when I am in the grave.►
[RHQ]
16 After I descend to the place where the dead are, ◄will I be able to confidently
expect anything good there?/I certainly will not be able to confidently expect
anything good there.► [RHQ]
JOB 18:1
745
JOB 18:21
It will be as though [RHQ] I and the things I hope for will descend with me into
the dust where the dead are.”
18
Bildad’s second reply
1 Then Bildad replied again:
2 “When are you going to stop talking [RHQ]?
If you would stop talking and listen, we could tell you something.
3 Why do you think that we are as stupid as cattle? [DOU, RHQ]
4 By being very angry and hurting yourself,
do you think that doing that will shake the earth,
or cause the rocks in the mountains to move? [RHQ]?
5 “What will happen is that the lives of wicked people like you end
as quickly as we can put out a light or extinguish the flame of a fire.
6 And when the lamps above them in their tents are extinguished,
there will be no light in those tents.
because they themselves did not heed the advice that they gave to others.
or fell into a pit that they themselves have dug.
9 It was as though a trap grabbed their heels and held them fast [DOU],
10 as though the noose of a rope that was hidden on the ground, whose other end was
fastened to the limb of a tree,
seized them when they walked into it.
11 Everywhere they went, there were things that caused them to be terrified;
it was as though those things were pursuing them and biting at their heels.
12 They became hungry, with the result that they had no strength.
They experienced disasters [PRS] constantly.
13 Diseases spread all over their skin/bodies;
diseases that ◄caused their bodies to decay/destroyed their arms and legs►.
14 When they died, they were snatched away from their tents
and brought to the one who rules over the dead.
15 Now their tents will burn down,
when burning sulfur rains down on those tents!
they were like trees whose roots have dried up and whose branches have all
17 No one on the earth will remember them any more;
no one on any street will even remember their names [MTY].
18 They will be expelled from the earth where there is light,
and they will be sent into the place where it is dark.
19 They will have no children or grandchildren,
no descendants where they previously lived.
20 People from the east to the west who hear about what happened to them,
will be shocked and horrified.
21 And that is what happens to ungodly/sinful people like you,
to people who ◄have no interest in/have rejected► God.”
JOB 19:1
Job replied again
746
JOB 19:21
19
1 Then Job replied,:
2 “How long will you three torment me
and crush my spirit by saying to me that I am wicked?
3 You have already insulted me many [HYP] times;
◄are you not ashamed for saying these things to me?/you should be ashamed for
saying these things to me.► [RHQ]
4 Even if it were true that I have done things that are wrong,
I have not injured you!
5 If you truly think that you are better than I am,
and you think that my being miserable now proves that I ◄am guilty/ have
committed many sins►,
6 you need to realize that it is God who has caused me to suffer.
It is as though he has trapped me with his net.
7 “I cry out, ‘Help me!’,
but no one answers me.
I call out loudly, but there is no one, not even God, who acts fairly toward me.
8 It is as though [MET] God has blocked my way,
with the result that I cannot go where I want to;
it is as though he has forced me to try to find my way in the darkness.
9 He has ◄taken away my good reputation/caused people not to honor me any more►;
it is as though he removed [MET] a crown from my head.
He has caused me to no longer confidently expect him to do good things for me.
11 He attacks me because he is extremely angry with me [MET],
and he considers that I am his enemy.
12 It is as though he sends his army to attack me;
they surround my tent,
preparing to attack me.
13 “God has caused my brothers to abandon me,
and all those who know me act like strangers to me.
14 All my relatives and good friends have left me.
15 The people who were guests in my house have forgotten me,
and my female servants consider that I am a stranger or that I am a foreigner.
when I stand up to talk to them, they laugh at me.
19 My dearest friends detest me,
and those whom I love very much have turned against me.
20 My body is only skin and bones;
I am barely alive [IDM].
21 “I plead with you, my three friends, pity me,
because God has ◄struck [EUP] me with his hand/caused me to suffer greatly►.
JOB 19:22
747
JOB 20:12
22 Why do you cause me to suffer like God does?
Why do you continue to slander [MET] me?
23 “I wish/desire that someone would take these words of mine
and write them permanently in a book in order that people can read them.
24 Or else, I wish that he would carve them on a rock with ◄a chisel/an iron tool►
in order that they would last forever.
25 But I know that the one who vindicates/defends me in court is alive,
and that some day he will stand here on the earth and make the final decision
about whether I deserve to be punished.
26 And even after diseases have eaten away my skin,
while I still have my body, I will see God.
27 I will see him myself;
I will see him with my own eyes!
I am overwhelmed as I think about that!
28 “If you three men say, ‘What more can we do to cause Job to suffer?’
and if you say, ‘He has caused his own troubles,’
29 you should be afraid that God will punish [MTY] you;
he punishes those like you with whom he is angry;
and when that happens, you will know that there is someone who judges people.”
20
Zophar replied again
1 Then Zophar replied,
2 “I am very perturbed about what you have said,
so I want to reply very quickly.
3 By saying these things you have insulted me,
but I know how (OR, because I understand very much) I can reply to you.
4 “Do you not know that from long ago,
ever since people were first put on the earth,
5 wicked people like you do not continue to rejoice for a long time,
ungodly people are happy only for a ◄moment/very short time► [HYP]?
6 Even though their reputation/pride reaches up to the sky
and their fame goes up as high as the clouds,
7 they will disappear forever, like their own dung,
and those who knew them will ask, ‘◄Where did they go/What happened to
8 They will be forgotten like [SIM] a dream is,
and they will exist no more.
They will vanish, like visions that people see during the night.
9 Those who saw those people previously will never see them again;
even their families [MTY] will not see them any more.
10 Their children will be forced to return the valuable things that those children stole
from poor people [DOU].
11 Previously their bodies were young and strong,
but they will die and their bodies will be buried in the ground.
12 “Doing wicked things was like having sweet food in their mouths,
JOB 20:13
748
JOB 21:2
and they wanted to continue to taste it.
13 And they did not want to stop doing those things,
14 but some day the evil things that they enjoyed doing will become like food that they
swallow
and which becomes as bitter as snake venom.
15 Wicked people will not continue to keep the money they have accumulated,
like people do not keep the food that they vomit.
God takes their wealth from them.
16 What wicked people do is like [MET] swallowing snake venom;
it will kill them like [MET] the bite of a poisonous snake kills people.
17 They will not remain alive to see abundant blessings [IDM] from God, milk and
olive oil and honey,
that are so abundant they are like [MET] a stream that flows by.
18 They will be forced to give back the things that they stole from the poor;
they will not be able to continue to enjoy those things.
They will not remain happy because of what they got from their businesses,
19 because they oppressed poor people and refused to help them,
and they took other people’s houses by cheating them.
20 “They were always greedy and never satisfied.
They just keep dreaming about owning more and more things.
21 When they finished eating their food, there was never anything left over because
they had greedily eaten it all;
but now their prosperity will end.
22 When they are extremely prosperous/wealthy,
they will suddenly experience a lot of trouble.
◄Misery will strike them and crush them [PRS]/They will suffer very greatly►.
God will show that he is very angry with them and punish them;
24 They will try to escape from being killed by iron weapons,
25 The arrows will go completely through their bodies and stick out of their backs;
the shiny points of the arrows will have blood dripping from them,
and those wicked people will be terrified.
26 Their valuable possessions will all be destroyed;
a fire that is not lit by humans, but by God, will burn them up
and also destroy the things that are left in their tents.
27 The angels in heaven [MTY] will reveal the sins that those wicked people have
committed,
and people on earth will stand up and testify against them.
28 When God punishes [MTY] people,
all the possessions in the wicked people’s houses will be carried away by a flood.
29 That is what will happen to wicked people like you;
that is what God has decided will happen to them.”
21
Job replied again
1 Then Job replied,
2 “Listen to what I say, all three of you;
JOB 21:3
749
JOB 21:21
that is the only thing that you can do that will comfort me.
3 Be patient with me, and allow me to speak.
Then, after I am finished speaking, you can continue to make fun of me.
4 “It is certainly not [RHQ] people against whom I am complaining, but God
And it is certainly [RHQ] right for me to be impatient!
5 Look at me! Does what you see not cause you to be appalled
and to put your hands over your mouths and say no more?
6 When I think about what has happened to me,
I am frightened and my entire body shakes.
7 “But let me ask this: ‘Why do wicked people continue to live,
and become prosperous, and not die until they are very old?’
8 They have their children around them,
and they watch them while they grow up and start to live in their own houses,
9 Wicked people live in their own houses without being afraid,
10 Their bulls always mate with the cows successfully,
and the cows give birth to calves and never miscarry.
11 Wicked people send their young children outside to play,
and the children play happily like [SIM] lambs in a pasture.
12 Some children dance and sing, while others shake tambourines and play lyres,
and they are happy when they hear people playing flutes.
13 Wicked people enjoy having good things all the time that they are alive,
and they die quietly/peacefully and go down to the place of the dead.
14 While they are alive, they say to God, ‘Do not bother us;
we do not want to know how you want us to conduct our lives!
15 Why do you, Almighty God, think that we should serve you?
◄What advantage do we get if we pray to you?/It is useless for us to pray to you.►
[RHQ]’
16 Think about it: Wicked people think that it is because of what they have done that
they have become prosperous,
but I do not understand why they think like that.
17 ◄“How often does it happen that wicked people die [MET] before they are old?/
Very seldom do wicked people die [MET] before they are old.► [RHQ]
◄Do they ever experience disasters?/They seldom experience disasters.► [RHQ]
◄Does God ever punish them because of being very angry with them?/God never
punishes them because of being very angry with them.► [RHQ]
18 He does not blow them away like wind blows away straw;
they are never carried off by a whirlwind.
19 You say, ‘When people have committed sins,
God waits and punishes their children because of those sins;’
but I say that God should punish those who sin, not their children,
in order that the sinners will know that it is because of their own sins that they
are being punished.
20 I hope/wish that wicked people will experience themselves being destroyed,
that they will experience being punished by an angry Almighty God.
21 After wicked people are dead,
JOB 21:22
750
JOB 22:5
they are not at all concerned [RHQ] about what happens to their families [MTY].
22 “Since God judges everyone, even those that are in heaven,
◄who can teach God anything?/certainly no one can teach God anything.► [RHQ]
23 Some people die while they are very healthy,
while they are peaceful, when they are not afraid of anything.
24 Their bodies are fat;
their bones are strong.
and maggots eat their bodies.
Everyone dies, so it is clear that dying is not always the punishment for being wicked.
27 “Listen, I know what you three are thinking.
I know the evil things that you plan to do to me.
28 You say, ‘What happened to the tents in which wicked people were living?
The houses of evil rulers have been destroyed!’
29 But have you never inquired of people who travel much?
Do you not believe their reports about what they have seen,
30 that wicked people usually do not suffer at the time when there are great disasters;
that wicked people are the ones who are rescued when God is angry and punishes
people [MTY]?
31 There is no one [RHQ] who accuses wicked people,
and there is no one who ◄pays them back/gives them the punishment that they
deserve► for all the evil things that they have done.
32 The corpses of wicked people are carried to their graves,
and people are put there to guard those graves.
33 A huge number [HYP] of people go to the grave site.
Some go in front of the procession and some come behind.
And the clods of dirt thrown on the graves of those wicked people who have died
are like a nice blanket.
34 “So how can you console me by talking nonsense?
Every reply that you make is full of lies!”
22
Eliphaz replied again
1 Then Eliphaz replied,
2 “◄Can anyone be useful to God?/Certainly no one can be useful to God.► [RHQ]
Even people who are wise cannot be helpful to God.
3 If you were righteous, ◄would that benefit Almighty God?/that certainly would not
benefit Almighty God.► [RHQ]
If you had ◄lived a perfect life/never done anything that is wrong►, would that
help him?
4 “Is it because you have an awesome respect for God that he punishes you?
Is that the reason that he puts you on trial?
5 No, it certainly must be [RHQ] because you are extremely wicked.
JOB 22:6
751
JOB 22:25
It must be that the evil things that you have done are so many that no one can
count them!
6 You must have lent money to others and wrongly forced them to give you things to
guarantee that they would pay that money back to you;
you must have taken all their clothes and left them with nothing to wear.
7 You must not have given water to those who were thirsty,
and you must have refused to give food to those who were hungry.
8 Because you were very powerful, you must have taken over all the people’s land,
and then, being very respected, you have begun to live on that land.
9 When widows came to you for help, you must have sent them away without giving
them anything,
and you must have oppressed orphans.
10 Because of all that, now there are pits around you for you to fall into,
and suddenly there are things that terrify you and cause you to tremble.
11 It is as though it has become very dark, with the result that you cannot see anything,
and it is as though [MET] a flood covers you.
12 “But consider this, Job: God lives [RHQ] high up in the heavens.
From there he [RHQ] looks down on the highest stars.
13 So why do you say, ‘What does God know about what we are doing?
He is hidden from us by dark clouds, so ◄how can he judge us?/he certainly cannot
judge us.► [RHQ]’
14 Do you think that while he walks on the dome that covers the sky,
there are thick clouds around him, with the result that he cannot see what we
do?
15 Will you continue to conduct your life the old way
that evil people have done for many years?
16 They suddenly died while they were still young;
they disappeared like everything disappears when there is a flood [MET].
17 They kept saying to God, ‘Do not bother us,’
and they also said defiantly, ‘Almighty God can do nothing [RHQ] to harm us!’
18 But it was God who filled their houses with good things,
so I cannot at all understand why wicked people think like they do.
19 “But when God punishes wicked people, and righteous people see that, they are
glad,
and they laugh, ridiculing the wicked people.
20 They say, ‘Now our enemies have been destroyed,
and all their possessions that were left have been burned in a fire.’
21 “So, Job, be reconciled to God and make peace with him;
if you do that, good things will happen to you.
23 If you humble yourself and return to God,
if you stop doing all the evil things that you have been doing in your house,
24 if you throw away your gold,
even the fine gold from the dry stream beds in Ophir land,
25 and if you allow Almighty God to be as precious to you as your gold and your silver
have been,
JOB 22:26
752
JOB 23:16
26 you will be happy because of your close relationship with God,
and you will be able to approach him [IDM] confidently.
27 You will pray to him, and he will do what you request him to do;
you will do the things that you promised him that you would do.
of doing things that are wrong►.”
Job replied again
1 Then Job replied again,
2 “Today I am again complaining bitterly/strongly to God;
I continue groaning, but he [SYN] continues to ◄punish me/cause me to suffer►.
3 I ◄wish that I knew/want to know► where I could meet/talk with him,
so that I could go to the place where he lives.
4 If I could do that, I would tell him why I know that I am innocent;
I would tell [MTY] to him all my ◄arguments/evidence to show that I have not
done what is evil►.
5 Then I would find out what he would reply to me [DOU].
6 Would he use his great power to argue with me?
No, he would listen to me carefully.
7 I am ◄an honest/a righteous► man; so I would be able to discuss things with him
fairly,
and then he would declare that I am innocent, and that decision would endure
forever.
8 “But, I have gone to the east, and he is not there;
I have gone to the west, but I have not found him there.
9 I have gone north and I have gone south,
but I have not seen him anywhere.
10 But he knows how I have conducted my life;
and when he has finished testing me, he will see that I am as pure as [SIM] gold
whose impurities have all been burned out.
11 I [SYN] have faithfully walked on the path that he showed me;
I have not stopped obeying him.
12 I have always obeyed what he [SYN] commanded;
I have treasured the words that he has spoken.
13 “He never changes. There is no one who can [RHQ] stop him from doing what he
desires.
Whatever he wants to do, he does.
14 And he will finish doing for me the things that he has planned for me;
and I am sure that he has thought about doing many things for me.
when I think about what he can do, I am very afraid [DOU].
16 Almighty God has caused me [SYN] to feel terrified [DOU].
JOB 23:17
753
JOB 24:17
17 It is as though there is only thick darkness in front of me,
but it is God that I am afraid of, not the darkness.”
24
Job continued his reply
1 “◄Why does Almighty God not set a time when he will judge evil people?/I do not
understand why Almighty God does not set a time when he will judge evil
people.► [RHQ]
Those who know him never [RHQ] see him do that!
2 Some evil people remove the markers of boundaries of other people’s land, in order
to steal their land;
they seize/steal other people’s sheep and put them in their own pastures.
3 Some ◄take away/steal► the donkeys that belong to orphans,
and they take widow’s oxen to guarantee that the widows will pay back the
money that they loaned to those widows.
4 Some shove poor people off the road (OR, prevent poor people from ◄obtaining their
rights/being treated justly►),
and they force poor people to find places to hide from them.
5 The result is that poor people have to search for food in the desert
like wild donkeys do.
6 The poor people harvest left-over grain in other people’s fields,
and gather grapes from vineyards that belong to wicked men.
7 During the night they have nothing to cover their bodies,
nothing to keep them warm.
8 When it rains on the mountains, the poor people become very wet,
so they huddle under the rock ledges to be protected from the rain.
9 Some evil men snatch infants away from their widowed mothers [SYN],
and they say ‘I will return your babies to you when you repay the money that I
lent to you.’
10 But the poor people walk around with no clothes on;
they are hungry while they are working to carry other people’s bundles of grain
to the places where their grain will be threshed.
11 Poor people press olives to make olive oil;
they tread on grapes to make juice for wine,
but they are not allowed to drink any of it when they become thirsty.
12 In the cities, people who are wounded and dying cry out to God for help,
but God does not heed their prayers.
13 Some wicked people avoid the light because they do evil things in the dark;
they do not walk on roads that are lighted.
14 Murderers steal things during the night,
and then they arise before dawn in order that they may go out again and kill
15 Those who want to commit adultery wait for twilight/evening;
16 It is during the night that robbers break into houses to steal things,
but during the day they hide because they want to avoid being seen in the light.
17 All of those people want to do their evil things at night, not in the morning when it
is light,
JOB 24:18
754
JOB 26:2
because they are not afraid of the things that happen during the night that terrify
others.”
(Final speech by Zophar)
18 “But it is wicked people who are swept/carried away by floods,
and God curses the land that they own,
and no one goes to work in their vineyards.
19 Just like the snow melts away when it is hot and there is no rain,
those who have sinned disappear into the place where dead people are.
20 Not even their mothers remember them now;
wicked people are destroyed like trees that are cut down,
and maggots eat their corpses.
21 They mistreat women who have been unable to give birth to children and women
who no longer have children to take care of them,
and they never do good things for widows.
22 But God, by his power, gets rid of mighty/influential people.
God acts and causes the wicked people to die.
23 God allows them to think that they are secure and safe,
but he is watching [MTY] them all the time.
24 They prosper for a little while,
and then suddenly they are gone;
they disappear like weeds wither and die;
they are like [SIM] stalks of grain that have been cut off.
25 If this is not true, is there [RHQ] anyone who will show that I am a liar
and prove that what I have said is not true?”
25
Bildad’s final reply
1 Then Bildad also replied,
2 “God is very powerful; everyone should have an awesome respect for him;
he causes everything to be peaceful high up in heaven.
3 ◄Can anyone count the angels who are in his army in heaven?/No one can count the
angels who are in his army in heaven.► [RHQ]
◄Is there any place where his light does not shine?/There is no place where his
light does not shine.► [RHQ]
4 So, ◄how can God consider anyone to be righteous?/God certainly cannot consider
anyone to be righteous.► [RHQ]
[RHQ]
5 Consider this: God does not even consider the full moon to be bright,
and he does not consider the stars to be spotless.
6 So, ◄what about humans?/he does not consider humans to be important.► [RHQ]
They are as insignificant as [MET] maggots.
God does not think more highly of people than he thinks of worms.”
26
Job replied to Bildad again
1 Job replied to Bildad, saying this sarcastically:
2 “I am a very weak and helpless man;
JOB 26:3
755
JOB 27:8
and ◄you certainly have not helped me [SAR] very much!/do you think that you
have helped me [SAR] very much?► [RHQ]
3 ◄You certainly have counseled me well—I, who am not wise at all./Do you think that
you have counseled me well—I, who am not wise at all?► [RHQ]
◄I’m sure you think that you have given a lot of very good advice to me. [RHQ]
4 Who helped you to say all those great/wise things?
Who inspired you to speak like you did?”
Bildad replied
5 “Because the spirits of dead people are afraid,
they tremble in the waters that are deep under the earth.
6 God knows all about those who are in the place of the dead;
there is nothing down there that prevents God from seeing what is there.
7 God stretched out the earth over the huge empty space
and caused the earth to have nothing to support it.
8 He fills the thick/dense clouds with water
and prevents that water from bursting the clouds.
9 He causes clouds to ◄obscure/prevent us from seeing► the moon.
10 He separated the light from the darkness
begins.
They are ◄shocked/very fearful►, and they tremble.
with his skill/wisdom he destroyed Rahab, the huge sea monster.
with his hand he killed the great dragon in the sea.
14 But those events show only a small amount of his power;
it is as though we are hearing only whispers of his powerful voice.
When we hear thunder, we say, ‘◄Who can really understand how great his power
is/No one can really understand how great his power is!► [RHQ]’ ”
Job replied one more time
27
1 Job replied again to his three friends,
2 “Almighty God has refused to treat me justly/fairly.
He has caused me to feel bitter/resentful.
But just as surely as he lives,
3 as long as God’s Spirit enables me to breathe,
4 I will not lie;
I [SYN] will not say anything to deceive anyone.
5 I will never admit that what you three have said is true;
until the day that I die, I will insist that I have not done things that are wrong.
6 I will say that I am innocent, and never ◄say anything different/change what I say►;
my conscience will never reproach me as long as I live.
7 “I want my enemies to be punished like all wicked people are punished;
I want God to punish those who oppose me like he punishes all unrighteous people.
8 When it is time for God to get rid of godless/wicked people and to cause them to die,
there is absolutely nothing good [RHQ] that they can confidently expect to happen
to them.
JOB 27:9
756
JOB 28:3
9 When they experience troubles, ◄will God hear them call out to him for help?/God
certainly will not hear them call out to him for help.► [RHQ]
10 ◄Will they be happy about what Almighty God does?/They certainly will not be
happy about what Almighty God does.► [RHQ]
◄Will they begin to pray to him frequently?/They certainly will not begin to pray
to him frequently.► [RHQ]
Certainly not!
11 “I will teach you three something about the power [MTY] of Almighty God [MTY];
I will reveal what he is thinking.
12 But you three have seen for yourselves what God has done;
so ◄why are you saying such nonsense?/ you should not be saying such
nonsense.► [RHQ]
13 “I will tell you what Almighty God does to wicked people,
the things that he does to people who oppress others.
14 Even if they have many children, many of those children will die in wars [MTY],
and their other children will die because they do not have enough food to eat.
15 Their children who are still alive will die from diseases,
and their widows will not even mourn for them.
16 Sometimes wicked people accumulate a huge amount [SIM] of silver
and pile up clothes like [SIM] those clothes were a pile of clay,
17 but those wicked people will die, and then righteous people will wear those clothes,
and honest/innocent people will get their silver and divide it among themselves.
18 The houses that they build are as frail/fragile as [SIM] spider webs,
or they are like flimsy huts that watchmen live in while they guard people’s fields.
19 Wicked people are rich when they lie down at night,
but when they wake up in the morning, they find out that their money has
disappeared.
20 “Things that terrify them [PRS] strike them like a flood [SIM];
during the night a whirlwind carries them away.
21 It is as though the wind from the east picks them up and carries them away from
their homes,
and they disappear.
22 That wind strikes them without pitying them
while they are running away, trying to escape from its force/power [MTY].
23 That wind is like someone clapping his hands [MET] at them to ridicule them,
howling at them wherever they run to.”
28
and they ◄smelt copper ore/heat copper ore to get the copper from it►.
3 Men use lamps while they work far down under the ground
to search for the ore inside the mines
where it is very dark.
JOB 28:4
757
JOB 28:24
4 They dig ◄shafts/narrow holes very deep down into the ground► in places that are
far from where people live,
where travelers do not go.
They work far away from other people,
swinging back and forth on ropes as they descend into the mine shafts.
5 Food grows on the surface of the ground,
but down under the ground, where there is no food, the miners make fires to
break apart the rocks.
6 The stones that are dug from under the ground contain ◄sapphires/very valuable
blue stones►,
and the dirt contains bits of gold.
7 Some birds have very good eyes,
but even hawks do not know where the mines are,
and falcons/vultures have not seen those places.
8 Lions or other proud wild animals have not walked on the roads near those mines.
9 Miners tear apart [MTY] very hard rock;
it is as though they turn the mountains upside down to get the ore.
10 They cut tunnels through the rocks,
and they find ◄precious/very valuable► things.
11 They dam up small streams in order that water does not flow,
and they bring up into the light valuable things that are hidden in the ground and
in the streams.
12 “But wisdom: Where can people find that?
Where can we find out how to truly understand things?
13 Humans do not know where to find it;
no one can find it here on this earth where they are living.
14 It is as though water that is deep inside the earth and water that is in the seas say
[PRS],
‘Wisdom is not here!’
15 People cannot buy wisdom
by paying for it with silver or gold.
or other very valuable stones.
worth more than vases made from fine gold.
18 Wisdom is worth more than coral or crystal/pure quartz;
the price of wisdom is higher/more than the price of pearls.
19 The prices of ◄topaz/very valuable yellow stones► from Ethiopia and of pure gold
are lower/less than the price of wisdom.
20 “So, where does wisdom come from?
Where can we find out how to truly understand things?
21 No living humans can see it [MTY];
and birds cannot see it while they are flying [MTY].
22 It is as though the places where people go after they die say [PRS],
‘We have only heard rumors about where to find wisdom.’
23 God is the only one who knows how to find wisdom;
he knows where it is,
24 because he can see things even in the most remote/distant places on the earth;
he can see everything that is below the sky.
JOB 28:25
758
JOB 29:17
25 When he decided how strongly the winds should blow,
and how much rain would be in the clouds,
26 and when he decided where rain should fall,
and what path lightning should take from the clouds down to the ground,
27 at that time he saw wisdom and decided that it is extremely valuable.
He examined it and ◄approved it/said that it was very good►.
28 And then he said to humans, ‘Listen! To have an awesome respect for me is what
will enable you to become wise;
and to truly understand everything, you must first turn away from doing what
is evil.’ ”
Job’s final speech
during the years when God took care of me.
3 During those years, it was as though God’s lamp [MET] shone on me
and gave me light while I walked in the darkness.
4 At that time I was young and strong,
and because God was my friend, he protected [PRS] my tent.
5 Almighty God was with me during those years
when all my children were around me.
6 My herds provided me with plenty of milk,
and streams of oil flowed from the rock where my olives were pressed.
7 “Whenever I went to the place where the elders gathered at the city gate,
I sat down with them,
8 and when the young men saw me, they stepped aside respectfully,
and the old men also stood respectfully.
9 The leaders of the people stopped talking [DOU],
10 and even the most important men became quiet
and ceased talking [MTY] in order to hear me speak to them.
11 When they [SYN] all heard what I told them,
they said good things about me.
When they [SYN] saw me (OR, what I had done), they commended me,
12 because I had helped the poor people when they cried out for help
and I aided/helped orphans who had no one else to help them.
13 Those who were suffering and about to die praised [PRS] me,
and I caused widows [SYN] to sing joyfully, because of my helping them.
14 I always acted justly;
my continually doing that was like [MET] a robe that I wore and a turban that
15 It was as though [MET] I was eyes for blind people
16 I was like [MET] a father to poor people,
17 My causing wicked people to be unable to continue oppressing others was like [MET]
and forcing them to drop from their teeth/mouths the animals that they had
caught/seized.
JOB 29:18
759
JOB 30:10
18 “At that time I thought, ‘Surely I will live securely, until I am very old [SIM],
and I will die at home with my family.’
19 I was like a tree [MET] whose roots reach down into the water
and whose branches become wet with dew each night.
20 People always honored me,
and I was always strong like [MET] a new bow.
21 “When I spoke, people waited to hear what I would say
and remained silent until I advised them what they should do.
22 After I finished speaking, they did not say any more;
it was as though [MET] my words fell on their ears like refreshing drops of rain.
23 They waited for me to speak like they wait for rain;
they appreciated what I said like [MET] farmers appreciate the final rain in the
spring before the dry season.
24 When they were discouraged, I smiled at them to encourage them;
they became encouraged when they saw that I approved of them.
25 I was their leader, and I decided what things would be good for them to do;
I was among them like [SIM] a king who is among his troops;
I was like someone who comforts others who are mourning.”
30
Job ridicules the fathers of young men
1 “But now men who are younger than I am make fun of me—
men whose fathers I greatly despised,
with the result that I would not even have allowed them to help my dogs guard
my sheep.
2 They were men who were old and ◄weak/worn out►;
so ◄what could I gain from them working for me?/I would have gained nothing
from them working for me.► [RHQ]
3 They were very poor and hungry,
with the result that they chewed on roots at night
in dry and desolate places.
4 They pulled up plants in the desert and ate them
and warmed themselves by burning the roots of broom trees.
5 Everyone shouted at them as though they were thieves
and expelled them from their areas.
6 They were forced to live in caves in the hills,
in holes in the ground, and in the sides of cliffs.
and they huddled together under thornbushes.
whose names no one knows;
Job stated how he was despised
9 “And now their children sing songs to make fun of me.
They tell jokes about me.
10 They are disgusted with me, and they usually stay away from me,
but when they see me, they are happy to spit in my face.
JOB 30:11
760
JOB 30:31
11 Because it is as though [MET] God has cut my bowstring, he has caused me to be
unable to defend myself, and he has humbled me,
and my enemies have done to me whatever they wanted.
12 ◄Gangs/Groups of violent youths► attack me and force me to run away;
they prepare to destroy me.
13 They prevent me from escaping,
and they do not need anyone to help them (OR, there is no one to help me).
14 It is as though I am a city wall and [SIM] they have broken through the wall,
and they have come crashing down on me.
15 I am very terrified;
My dignity/honor has been taken away as though [SIM] it has been blown away
by the wind,
and my prosperity has disappeared like [SIM] clouds disappear.
Job stated that God also mistreated him
16 “And now I [SYN] am about to die [IDM];
I suffer every day.
17 My bones ache during the night,
and the pain that torments me never stops.
18 It is as though God seizes my clothes
and chokes me with the collar of my coat.
19 He has thrown me into the mud;
I am not worth anything more than dust and ashes.
20 “I cry out to God, but he does not answer/help me;
I stand up and pray, but he does not pay any attention.
21 He acts very cruelly toward me;
with all of his power [MTY] he causes me to suffer.
22 He allows the wind to lift me up and blow me away,
and he tosses me up and down in a violent storm.
23 I know that he will cause me to die,
which is what happens to everyone [MTY] who is alive.
24 “When people experience disasters,
and they sit on a pile of ruins and cry out for help,
others surely [RHQ] reach out their hand to help them.
25 That is what I did previously. I wept for people who were experiencing troubles,
and I felt sorry for poor/needy people.
26 But when I expected good things to happen to me, evil things happened;
when I waited for light/happiness, all I experienced was darkness/unhappiness
[MET].
27 I am very distressed [IDM], all the time;
I suffer every day.
28 I go about very discouraged;
I stand up and plead for people to help me.
29 My wailing sounds as sad as [MET] the cries of jackals/foxes and ostriches.
30 My skin has become dark/black and is peeling off,
and I have a fever which causes my body to feel like it is burning.
31 Previously, I played joyful music on my harp and with my flute,
but now I play only the sad music of those who mourn.”
JOB 31:1
Job stated his innocence
761
JOB 31:16-18
31
1 “I solemnly promised myself
that I would not look at a young woman with a desire to have sex with her.
2 If I did not do what I promised,
what would God who is in heaven [MTY] do to me [RHQ]?
Almighty God would certainly not [RHQ] give me any reward!
3 Previously I thought that surely [RHQ] it was unrighteous people who would
experience calamities,
and that it was those who do what is wrong who would experience disasters.
4 God certainly sees [RHQ] everything that I do,
It is as though he counts every step that I take.
6 I request only that God judge me fairly [MET],
and if he does that, he will know that I ◄am innocent/have not done what is
wrong►.
7 If it were true that I have stopped living righteously,
or that I [SYN] have desired the things that I look at [MTY],
or that I am guilty of any other sin,
8 then I hope/wish that when I plant seeds, someone else will harvest the crops and
eat them
and that others will uproot the fruit trees that I planted.
9 “If it were true that I [SYN] have been attracted by some other man’s wife,
or that I have hidden myself and waited outside the door to her house,
10 I hope/desire that my wife will become the servant/slave of another man
and have sex [EUP] with him.
11 For me to do that would be a terrible sin,
and the judges would decide that I should be punished.
12 My committing adultery would produce in me a fire like [MET] the fire that burns
and it would burn up everything that I own.
13 “And, if it were true that I have ever refused to listen to one of my male or female
servants
when they complained to me about something,
14 God would arise and declare that he would punish me;
and when he would do that, what would I do?
If he would ask me about what I have done, ◄what would I answer?/I would not
be able to answer.► [RHQ]
15 God, who created me, certainly also created my servants [RHQ];
surely he is the one who formed them and me in our mothers’ wombs [RHQ];
so we all should behave toward each other equally.
16-18 “I have guided orphans from the time that they were born;
I have taken care of them since they were young.
So, if it were true that I ate all my food myself and did not share some of it with
orphans,
JOB 31:19
762
JOB 31:37
or that I refused to give poor people the things that they wanted,
or that I caused widows to live ◄in despair/without hope that they would receive
any help from anyone►,
or that I had seen poor people who did not have clothes to keep them warm,
sheep
with the result that they thanked me for giving them clothes,
21 or if it were true that I threatened to strike any orphan
because I knew that the elders at the city gates would ◄decide in my favor►;
22 if those things were true about me, I hope/desire that my shoulder blade would be
torn out
and my arm be torn from my shoulder.
23 I always feared that God would cause me to experience a great disaster if I did any
of those evil things,
and I would not have been able to endure the powerful things that he would do
to punish me.
24 “If it were true that I trusted in my gold/money [DOU],
25 or that I rejoiced because I had acquired many things
and had become very rich,
26 or that I looked at the sun when it was shining
or looked at the beautiful moon
27 and I [SYN] had been tempted to worship them
by kissing my hand to revere them,
28 those things also would be sins for which the judges would say that I must be
punished,
because I would have been rejecting God by doing those things.
29-30 “It is not true that I [SYN] sinned by requesting God to curse people who hated
me
with the result that God would cause them to die.
It is also not true that I was glad when they were ruined
or that I rejoiced when they experienced disasters [DOU].
31-32 It is also not true that I never welcomed travelers to stay in my tent
or that I did not open my doors to them, but forced them to sleep in the streets.
All the men who work for me certainly know that [RHQ]!
33 Some people try to hide their sins,
but I have never done that;
34 and I never remained silent and refused to go outside of my home
because I was very ◄afraid of/worried about► what people would say about me,
and that they would hate/scorn me.
35 “I wish/desire that there was someone who would hear what I am saying!
I solemnly declare that all that I have said is true.
I wish that those who oppose me would write down on a scroll the evil things that
they say that I did.
head, in order that everyone could see it.
and I would approach him confidently, like a ruler would.
JOB 31:38
763
JOB 32:15
38 If it were true that I have stolen land,
with the result that it was as though its furrows cried out to accuse me of stealing;
39 or if it were true that I have eaten the crops that grew in someone else’s fields
without paying for those crops,
with the result that those farmers who grew those crops died from hunger;
40 then I wish/desire that thorns would grow in my fields instead of wheat.
May bad weeds grow instead of barley!”
That is the end of what Job said to his three friends.
32
Elihu replied to Job and his three friends
1 Then those three men stopped answering Job, because they could not convince Job
that he was wrong in claiming that he had not done anything that was wrong.
2 Then Elihu, the son of Barachel, a descendant of Buz, from the clan of Ram, became
very angry at Job. He was angry because Job continued to claim that he was righteous/
innocent, and that God was wrong to punish him.
3 He was also angry with Job’s three friends, because they had declared that Job
must have done many things that were wrong, but they were unable to convince Job
that what they said was true. As a result, it seemed to Elihu that God did what was
wrong by punishing Job.
4 Elihu was younger than the others, so he waited until they had finished speaking
before he replied to Job.
5 But when Elihu realized that the three men had no more to say [MTY] to Job, he
became angry.
6 And this is what he said:
“I am young, and you all are much older than I am.
So, I was timid, and I was afraid to tell you what I was thinking.
7 I thought, ‘Let those [PRS] who are much older speak,
because older people should be able to say things that are wise.’
8 But the Spirit of Almighty God is within people, and it is he who enables them to be
wise.
9 It is not people becoming old that enables them to be wise;
not all old people understand what is right.
10 “So, I say, ‘Listen to me,
and allow me to say what I think.’
11 I waited for you all to speak;
I wanted to hear the wise things that you would say.
I waited while you thought carefully about what would be the right things to say.
12 I paid attention carefully,
but surprisingly, none of you were able to prove that what Job said was wrong.
13 So, do not say to yourselves, ‘We have discovered what is wise!’
you three have not been able to do that.
but I will not reply to him by saying what you three said.
15 “You three are dismayed because you have not been able to convince him that he
was wrong,
JOB 32:16
764
JOB 33:14
so you are not saying any more to him [DOU].
16 But because you do not speak, I certainly will not wait any longer [RHQ];
you merely stand there and do not reply any more.
17 So now I also will reply to Job
and say what I think.
18 I have plenty to say,
and my spirit compels me to say it.
19 My inner being is like [SIM] a ◄wineskin/bag that has <new/fermenting> wine in
it►,
and it will soon burst.
20 I must speak [MTY], in order that I do not have to keep holding what I want to say;
I must say something [MTY] to reply to you all.
21 I will speak fairly, not favoring any of you,
and I will not try to flatter anyone.
22 I really do not know how to flatter people;
and if I did that, God would soon get rid of me.”
33
to all that I am going to say [DOU].
2 I am ready to tell you [MTY, DOU] what I think.
3 I know that I am speaking honestly
and that I am speaking [MTY] sincerely.
4 Almighty God has created me as well as you,
and his breath has caused me to live.
5 So, answer what I say if you can;
think carefully about how you will reply to me.
6 “God considers that you, and I are both equal;
he formed both of us from clay.
7 So you do not need to be afraid of me;
I will not crush/oppress you by what I say [MTY].
8 I have heard you [DOU] speaking,
and this is what you have said:
9 ‘I am innocent; I have not committed any sins;
I am pure; I have not done things that are wrong.
10 But God finds reasons to accuse me,
and he considers that I am his enemy.
11 It is as though he has put my feet ◄in stocks/between wooden blocks to prevent me
from walking away►,
and he watches everything that I do.’ [MTY]
12 But what you have said is wrong,
God is much greater than any human.
13 So, ◄why are you arguing against God, saying ‘He never answers my questions’?/
you should not be arguing against God, saying ‘He never answers my
questions.’► [RHQ]
14 God does speak to us in various ways,
JOB 33:15
765
JOB 33:33
but we do not pay any attention to what he says.
15 Sometimes he speaks to us at night in dreams and visions,
when we are on our beds, asleep [DOU].
16 He reveals things [MTY] to us
and terrifies us by the things he warns us about.
17 He tell us those things in order that we stop doing evil things
and to prevent us from becoming proud.
18 He does not want us to be destroyed [MTY];
he wants to prevent us from dying [MTY] while we are still young.
19 God also sometimes corrects us by forcing us to lie on our beds suffering much pain
and with fever/aching in our bones.
20 The result is that we do not desire any food,
not even very special food.
21 Our bodies become very thin, with the result that we look like skeletons [HYP],
and our bones stick out.
22 We know that we will soon die
and go to the place where dead people are.
23 “But sometimes an angel may come to one of us,
one of the thousands of angels who come to intervene between us and God,
to tell us what are the right things for us to do.
24 The angel is kind to us and says to God,
‘Release that person,
so that he does not descend to the place where dead people are!
Do that because I have found the money to pay so that he can be released!
25 Allow his body to be strong again;
allow him to be strong like he was when he was a youth!’
26 When that happens, that person will pray to God, and God will accept/answer him;
and then he will tell others how God saved him from dying.
‘I sinned, and I did things that were not right,
28 He has saved me from dying and going to the place where dead people are,
29 God does all these things for us many times;
30 he keeps us [SYN] from dying and going to the place where the dead are,
in order that we can continue to enjoy being alive [IDM].
31 So Job, listen to me;
do not say anything more; just allow me to speak.
32 After I speak, if you have something more that you want to say to me,
say it, because I would like to find a way to declare that you ◄are innocent/have
not done what is wrong►.
33 But if you have nothing more that you want to say, then just listen to me,
and I will teach you how to become wise.”
Elihu continued his challenge
34
JOB 34:1
766
JOB 34:21
1 Then Elihu continued:
2 “You three men who think that you [SAR] are very wise, hear me;
listen to what I am saying, you men who say that you know so much.
3 When we [SYN] hear what other people like you say,
we [RHQ] think carefully about what they say to determine what is good and what
is bad,
like we [SYN] taste food to determine what is good.
4 We need to decide who is saying what is right
and to determine among ourselves what is good/best.
5 Job has said, ‘I am innocent,
but God has refused to judge me fairly/justly.
6 Even though I have always done what is right,
he is lying about me.
Even though I have not done what is wrong,
he has caused me to suffer, and I will certainly die.’
7 ◄Is there any person like Job, who insults others as easily as people accept a drink
of water?/There is no person like Job, who insults others as easily as people
accept a drink of water.► [RHQ]
8 He habitually associates with people who do what is evil
and spends time with wicked people.
9 He has said, ‘It is useless for people to try to please God.’
10 “So, you men who claim that you understand everything, listen to me!
Almighty God would never consider doing anything that is wicked or wrong [DOU]!
11 He ◄pays back/punishes► people for what they have done;
he gives them what they deserve for the way that they have conducted their lives.
12 Truly, Almighty God never does what is wicked;
he always [LIT] does what is fair/just.
13 The authority that he has to rule everything on the earth, no one [RHQ] gave it to
him;
no one [RHQ] put him in control of the whole world.
He has always had that authority.
14 If he would take his spirit back to himself,
15 everyone would die immediately,
and their corpses would soon become dirt again.
16 “So, Job, if you say that you understand everything,
listen to what I am saying.
17 God could certainly not [RHQ] govern the world if he hated doing what is fair/just.
So, will you condemn God, who is righteous and powerful, saying that what he
has done is wrong?
18 He tells some kings that they are worthless,
and he says to some officials that they are wicked.
19 He does not favor rulers more than he favors others;
he does not favor rich people more than poor people,
because he created all of them.
20 People often die suddenly;
he strikes them at midnight and they die;
he even gets rid of mighty people without the help of any humans [SYN].
21 “He sees [MTY] everything that people do;
when we walk, he watches every step that we take.
22 There is no gloom or darkness [DOU] that is so dark
that sinners can hide from him in that darkness.
23 God does not need to set a time
when we will stand in front of him in order that he may judge us.
He can judge us whenever he wants to.
24 He destroys mighty people without needing to investigate what they have done,
and he appoints others to take their places.
25 Because he already knows what they have done,
he removes them at night and gets rid of them.
26 Where many people can see it,
he strikes/punishes them because of the wicked things that they have done;
27 he strikes them because they turned away from doing what he wanted them to do
and did not pay attention to any of his commands.
28 They mistreated the poor people,
with the result that those poor people cried out to God for help,
and he heard those afflicted people when they cried out to him.
29 But if God decides to do nothing to punish wicked people,
no one can criticize/condemn him.
If a godless/wicked man rules a nation,
a man who tricks/deceives the people,
30 and if God hides his face with the result that he does not see that ruler or punish
him,
no one will be able to prevent that ruler from doing those things.
31 “Job, have you or anyone else ever said to God, ‘I have been punished for my sins,
if I have done anything that is evil,
I will not do it any more’?
33 Job, you object to what God has done to you,
but do you think that he will do what you want him to do?
It is you who must choose what you say to God, not I;
so tell me what you are thinking about this.
34 “People who have good sense, those who are wise and who listen to what I say,
will say to me,
35 ‘Job is speaking ignorantly;
what he says is nonsense.’
36 I think that Job should be taken to a court and ◄put on trial/judged►,
because he answers us his friends like wicked men would answer.
37 To add to the other sins that he has committed, he is rebelling against God;
he shows us that he does not respect God [IDM],
35
Elihu continued his challenge
1 Then Elihu also said this:
2 “Job, do you think that what you said is right/correct?
You say, ‘God knows that I am innocent,’
JOB 35:3
768
JOB 36:4
3 and you say to God, ‘What good have I received for not sinning?
What benefit have I received from that?’ [DOU, RHQ]
4 Well, I will answer you,
and I will answer your three friends, too.
5 “Job, look up at the sky;
look at the clouds that are high above you
and realize that God is far above everything.
6 If you have sinned, that does not [RHQ] harm God at all.
If many times you do things that are wrong, that certainly does not [RHQ] affect
him [DOU].
7 And if you are righteous, does that help God?
No, he is not benefited by anything that you do [DOU].
8 It is other people who suffer because of the wicked things that you do,
but by doing good things for people, you help them.
9 “People cry out because of the many things that people do to others to ◄oppress
them/treat them cruelly►;
they call for help because of the things that powerful people do [MTY] to them.
10 But ◄no one/none of them► calls out to God,
saying ‘Why does God, my creator, not help me?
He should enable me to sing joyful songs, instead of very sad songs, during the
night.
11 He should be able to teach us more than all the wild animals do;
he should enable us to become wiser than all the birds are!’
12 People cry out for help,
but God does not answer them,
because those who cry out are proud and evil people.
13 It is useless for them to cry out,
14 So, when you complain that you cannot see God,
be punished for what you have done,
15 Furthermore, you say that because he does not pay attention when people commit
sins,
he does not become angry and punish them.
16 You say things that are useless;
you say a lot of things without knowing what you are talking about.”
36
1 Elihu finished by saying this:
2 “Job, be patient with me a little longer,
because I have something else to teach you.
I have something else to say that God wants you to know.
3 I will tell you what I have learned from many sources,
in order to show that God, my creator, is just/fair.
4 I am not saying anything to you that is false;
JOB 36:5
769
JOB 36:23
I, who am standing in front of you, am someone who understands things ◄very
well/perfectly► [HYP].
5 “Hey, God is very powerful, and he does not despise anyone,
and he understands everything.
6 He does not allow wicked people to remain alive,
and he always acts justly toward those who are poor.
7 He always watches over [MTY] those who are righteous;
he allows them to sit on thrones and rule with kings,
and they are honored forever.
8 But if people who commit crimes are caught,
they are thrown into prison and are caused to suffer by being fastened with chains.
9 When that happens, God shows them what they have done;
he shows them the sins that they have committed,
and he shows them that they have been proud/arrogant.
10 He causes them to listen [MTY] to what he is warning them,
and he commands them to turn away from doing what is evil.
11 If they ◄listen to/heed► him and serve him, after they get out of prison
they will prosper for all the years that they are alive and be peaceful/happy.
12 But if they do not ◄listen/pay attention► to him,
not knowing why God is causing them to die.
and they do not cry out for help,
even when God is punishing them.
14 They die while they are still young,
disgraced because of their very immoral behavior [EUP].
15 But God teaches people by causing them to suffer;
by afflicting them, he causes them to listen to [MTY] what he is telling them.
16 “And Job, I think that God wants to bring you out of your troubles
and allow you to live without distress;
he wants your table to be full of very nice food.
17 But now, you are being punished [MTY] as wicked people are punished;
God [PRS] has been punishing you ◄justly/as you deserve►.
18 So be careful that you are not deceived by desiring to acquire money
or that you are not ruined by accepting large bribes.
19 If you are deceived by those things, it certainly will not [RHQ] help you to cry out
when you are distressed;
all of your strength will not help you.
20 Do not wish that it would be nighttime in order that God will not see you and punish
you,
because night is the time when even people-groups are destroyed!
21 Be careful not to begin doing evil things,
because God has caused you to suffer to prevent you from doing evil.
22 “Hey, God is extremely powerful;
there is certainly [RHQ] no teacher who teaches like he does.
23 No one has [RHQ] told him what he should do,
JOB 36:24
770
JOB 37:12
and no one has [RHQ] said to him, ‘You have done what is wrong!’
24 People have always sung to praise him,
so you also should never forget to praise him for what he has done.
25 Everyone has seen what he has done,
but sometimes we can see it only from far away.
26 “Hey, God is very great, and we are not able to know how great he is,
and we do not know how old he is.
27 He draws water up from the earth and puts it in clouds
and causes it to become rain.
28 The rain pours down from the sky/clouds;
God causes abundant showers to fall on everyone.
29 No one can [RHQ] understand how the clouds move across the sky
or how it thunders in the sky where God lives.
30 He causes lightning to flash all around him,
but he causes the bottom of the oceans to remain dark.
31 By providing plenty of rain for us,
he enables us to have abundant food.
32 It is as though he holds the lightning in his hands,
and then he commands it to strike where he wants it to.
33 When we hear his thunder, we know that there will be a storm,
and the cattle know it, too.”
37
1 “My heart pounds [DOU] when I think about that.
2 Listen, all of you, to the thunder,
which is like God’s voice [DOU].
3 He causes thunder to be heard all across the sky,
and he causes lighting to flash to the most distant places on the earth.
4 After the lightning flashes, we hear the thunder
which is like [MET] God’s majestic voice;
he does not restrain the lightning when he speaks.
5 When God speaks, it is awesome, like thunder;
he does amazing things which we cannot fully understand.
6 He commands the snow to fall on the ground,
and sometimes he causes it to rain very hard.
7 And when God does that, it prevents people [SYN] from working,
in order that all people may know that he is the one who has done that (OR, what
8 When it rains, animals go into their hiding places,
and they remain there until the rain stops.
9 The storms/hurricanes come from the place in the south where they start,
and the cold wind comes from the north.
10 In the ◄winter/cold season►, the cold north wind is like God’s breath that causes
[MET] water to freeze;
he causes the lakes/streams to become ice.
11 God fills the clouds with moisture/hail,
12 He guides the clouds and causes them to move back and forth
JOB 37:13
771
JOB 38:3
in order that they may accomplish all that he commands them to do, all over the
world.
13 Sometimes God sends rain to punish us,
and sometimes he sends rain to show us that he acts kindly toward us.
14 “Job, listen to this;
stop and think about the wonderful things that God does.
15 ◄Do you know how God commands the lightning to flash down from the clouds?/
We do not know how God commands the lightning to flash down from the
clouds.► [RHQ]
16 Only God knows everything perfectly;
so ◄do you know how he causes the clouds to <move/ float> <amazingly/
wonderfully> across the sky?/you certainly do not know how he causes the
clouds to <move/float> <amazingly/wonderfully> across the sky!► [RHQ]
17 No, you just sweat there in your clothes;
it is very oppressive when the hot wind stops blowing from the south and all the
leaves on the trees ◄become still/do not move►.
18 ◄Can you stretch out the skies like God does and make them as hard as [SIM] a
sheet of polished brass?/You certainly cannot stretch out the skies like God does
and make them as hard as [SIM] a sheet of polished brass!► [RHQ]
19 “Job, tell us(exc) what we should say to God;
we do not know anything [IDM].
As a result, we do not know what to say to him to defend ourselves.
20 Should I tell God that I want to speak to him?
No, because if I did that, he might destroy me.
21 Now, people cannot look directly at the sun
when it shines brightly in the sky after the wind has blown the clouds away;
so, we certainly cannot look at the brightness of God.
22 God comes out of the north with a light that shines like gold;
his glory causes us to be afraid.
23 Almighty God is very powerful,
and we cannot come near to him.
He always acts righteously,
and he will never oppress us.
24 That is the reason that we have an awesome respect for him;
he does not pay attention to those who proudly, but wrongly, think that they are
wise.”
38
Yahweh replied to Job
You are speaking ignorantly!
so, just like men prepare themselves for a difficult task [MET],
prepare to answer my questions.
JOB 38:4
772
JOB 38:22
4 ◄“Where were you/Were you there with me► long ago when I ◄laid the foundations
of/created► the earth?
Since you know so much, tell me where you were at that time.
5 Do you know how I decided how large the earth would be?
Do you know who stretched a measuring tape around the earth?
Surely since you think that you know so much, you should know that!
6-7 What supports the pillars on which the earth rests?
When the stars that shine early in the morning sang together,
and someone put in place the stone that causes the earth to stay in its place,
and all the angels shouted joyfully when they saw that happening,
who laid that cornerstone? Did you?
8 “When the seas poured forth from inside the earth,
who prevented the water from flooding over the land?
9 It was I, not you, who caused clouds to come over the seas
and caused it to become very dark under those clouds.
10 I set limits for the seas,
and I put barriers so that the water would not come over the land.
11 I pointed to the shore and said to the water,
‘I permit you to come up to here, but I do not permit you to come any farther.
Your powerful waves must stop there!’
12 “Job, have you ever commanded the morning to begin?
Have you ever told the dawn to start a new day?
13 Have you ever told the dawn to spread out over the whole earth,
with the result that wicked people run away from the light?
14 When it becomes light after the dawn,
the hills and the valleys become clear like the folds in a cloth.
15 When it becomes daylight, the wicked do not have the darkness that they like;
in the daylight they no longer are able to raise up their arms, ready to hurt people.
16 “Job, have you traveled to the springs in the bottom of the ocean from which the
water in the seas comes?
Have you investigated/explored the very bottom of the oceans?
17 Has someone shown you the gates to the place where dead people are,
the gates to the place where it is very dark?

Tell me, if you know all these things!

773
JOB 39:1
23 I store the snow and the hail in order that I can use them to help my people when
they have troubles,
in times when they are fighting wars [DOU].
24 And where is the road to the place from which I cause the lightning to flash?
Where is the place from where the east wind begins to blow over all the earth?
25 Who created the channels in which the rain comes down from the sky?
Who makes the roads for the thunder/lightning?
26 Who causes rain to fall in the desert,
in places where no one lives?
27 Who sends the rain that gives moisture/water to areas where nothing has grown,
with the result that grass begins to grow again?
28 Does the rain have a father?
Does the dew also have a father?
29 And from whose womb does ice come in the ◄winter/cold season►?
Who gives birth to the frost that comes down from the sky?
30 In the winter, the water freezes and becomes hard, like a rock,
and the surface of lakes becomes frozen.
31 “Job, can you fasten the chains that hold the stars together in clusters/groups in the
sky?
32 Can you tell the stars when they should shine?
Can you guide the stars in the groups in the northern sky whose names are the Big
Bear and the Little Bear?
33 Do you know the laws that the stars must obey?
Can you cause those same laws to rule everything here on the earth?

35 Can you cause flashes of lightning to come down and strike where you want it to
strike?
Do those flashes say to you, ‘Where do you want us to strike next?’
36 Who enables the clouds to know when they should cause rain to fall?
37 And who is skilled/wise enough to be able to count the clouds?
Who can tilt the jugs of water in the sky to cause the rain to fall,
38 with the result that the dry ground becomes hard
for some animal to pass by that they can kill,
can you find animals for a lioness to kill
so that she and her cubs can eat the meat and not be hungry any more?
41 Who provides dead animals for crows,
when the baby crows are calling out to me for food,
when they are so weak because of their lack of food that they ◄stagger around/
can hardly stand up► in their nests?”
39
Yahweh continued his reply to Job
1 “Job, do you know at what time/season of the year the female mountain goats give
birth?
Have you watched the wild deer while their fawns were being born?
JOB 39:2
774
JOB 39:22
2 Do you know how many months pass from the time they become pregnant until
their fawns are born?
3 When they give birth, they crouch down
so that the fawns do not get hurt by falling to the ground when they are born.
4 The young fawns grow up in the open fields,
and then they leave their mothers and do not return to them again.
5 “Who allows the wild donkeys to go wherever they want [DOU]?
6 I am the one who put them in the desert,
in places where grass does not grow.
7 They do not like the noise in the cities;
in the desert they do not have to listen to the shouts of those who force donkeys
to work.
8 They go to the hills to find food;
there they search for grass to eat.
9 :Will a wild ox agree to work for you?
Will it allow you to keep it penned up at night in the place where you put feed
for your animals?
so that it will plow furrows/trenches in your fields?
Can you go away after you tell it what work it should do and assume that it will
do that work?
12 Can you rely on it to come back from the field,
bringing your grain to the place where you thresh it?
13 “Think also about the ostriches. They joyfully flap their wings,
but they do not have wing feathers that enable them to fly like storks do.
14 Ostriches lay their eggs on top of the ground and then walk away,
leaving the eggs to be warmed in the sand.
15 Ostriches do not worry that some wild animal may step on the eggs and crush them
[DOU].
16 Ostriches act cruelly towards their chicks;
they act as though the chicks belonged to some other ostrich.
They are not concerned if their chicks die,
and so the laying of the eggs was in vain.
17 That is because I did not allow ostriches to be wise.
I did not enable them to be intelligent.
18 But, when they get up and begin to run,
they scornfully laugh at horses with their riders
because the horses cannot run as fast as the ostriches!
19 And think about horses. Job, are you the one who caused horses to be strong?
Are you the one who put flowing ◄manes/long hair► on their necks?
20 Are you the one who enabled them to leap forward like locusts?
When they ◄snort/blow loudly through their noses►, they cause people to be
afraid.
21 They paw the ground, rejoicing about being very strong,
as they prepare to rush into a battle.
22 It is as if they laugh at the thought of being afraid. They are not afraid of anything!
JOB 39:23
775
JOB 40:10
They do not run away when the soldiers in the battle are fighting each other with
swords.
23 The quivers containing the riders’ arrows rattle against the horses’ sides,
and the spears and javelins flash in the light of the sun.
and they rush into the battle when the trumpet is blown.
They can smell a battle even when they are far away,
to their soldiers.
26 “And think about big birds.
Are you the one who enabled hawks to spread their
wings
and fly to the south for the winter?
because you commanded them to do that?
28 They live in holes in those cliffs.
there.
they see far away the animals that they can kill (OR, dead bodies of animals).
30 After an eagle kills an animal,
the baby eagles drink the blood of that animal.”
40
Yahweh continued his reply to Job
1 Then Yahweh said to Job,
2 “Do you still want to argue with me, the Almighty One?
Since you criticize me, ◄you should be able to answer my questions!/why are you
not able to answer my questions?► [RHQ]”
Job replied to Yahweh
3 Then Job replied to Yahweh,
4 “Now I realize that I am completely worthless.
So ◄how could I answer those
questions?/I could not possibly answer those questions!► [RHQ]
I will put my hand over my mouth and not say anything.
5 I have already said more than I should have said,
so now I will say nothing more.”
Yahweh challenged Job
6 Then Yahweh again spoke to Job from inside the great windstorm. He said,
7 “I want to ask you some more questions.
So as men prepare themselves for a difficult task [MET],
prepare yourself again to answer some more questions.
8 “Are you going to accuse me and say that I am unjust?
Are you going to say that what I have done is wrong, in order that you can say
that what you have done is right?
9 Are you as powerful [MTY] as I am?
Can your voice sound as loud as thunder, as mine can?
10 If you can do that, put on the robes
JOB 40:11
776
JOB 41:6
that show that you are glorious and are greatly honored!
11 Show that you are very angry;
show that you have the right/authority to humble people who are very proud!
12 Humble those proud people just by looking at them angrily
Crush wicked people quickly!
13 Bury them in the ground!
Send them to the place where dead people are,
where they will not be able to get out!
14 After you do that, I will congratulate/praise you
and say that truly you can save yourself by your own ability/power.
15 “Think also about the huge animals that live near the water.
I made you, and I made them also.
They eat grass, like oxen do.
16 Their legs/thighs are very strong,
and the muscles of their bellies are very powerful.
17 Their tails are stiff (OR, bend down) like the branches of a cedar tree.
The sinews/muscles of their thighs are close together.
18 Their thigh bones are like tubes made of bronze,
and the bones of their legs are like bars made of iron.
19 They are among the strongest of the animals that I made,
and I, who created them, am the only one who can kill them.
20 On the hills grows food [PRS] for them to eat
while many [HYP] other wild animals play nearby.
21 They lie down in the water under the lotus plants;
they hide in tall reeds in the swamps.
22 Those huge animals find shade under the lotus plants,
and they are surrounded by poplar trees.
23 They are not disturbed by raging/swiftly-flowing rivers;
they are not even disturbed/frightened when rivers like the Jordan River rush
over them.
24 No one can [RHQ] catch them by blinding their eyes
or by piercing their noses with the teeth of a trap!”
41
Yahweh challenged Job to try to capture a crocodile
1 “Think also about ◄crocodiles/great sea dragons►.
Can you catch them with a fishhook
2 Can you put ropes through their noses to control them
3 Will they plead with you to act mercifully toward them
4 Will they make an agreement with you to work for you,
to be your slaves as long as they live?
5 Can you cause them to become pets like you cause birds to become your pets?
Can you put a leash/rope around their necks so that your servant girls can play
with them?
6 Will merchants try to buy them in the market?
Will they cut them up into pieces and sell the meat?
JOB 41:7
777
JOB 41:28
7 Can you pierce their skins by throwing fishing spears at them?
Can you pierce their heads with a harpoon?
8 If you grab one of them with your hands, it will fight you in a way that you will
never forget,
and you will never try to do it again!
Anyone who tries to subdue one of them will lose his courage.
So, since I am much more powerful than they are, ◄who would dare to cause me
11 Also, everything on the earth is mine.
Therefore, no one [RHQ] is able to give anything to me and require me to pay
money for it!
and how strong their well-formed bodies are.
13 ◄Can anyone strip off their hides?/No one is able to strip off their hides.► [RHQ]
◄Can anyone try to put bridles on them?/No one can try to put bridles on them.►
[RHQ] (OR, Can anyone pierce their very thick hides?)
14 ◄Can anyone pry open their jaws, which have terrible teeth in them?/No one can
pry open their jaws, which have terrible teeth in them!► [RHQ]
15 They have rows of scales on their back
which are as hard as a rock (OR, tightly fastened together).
16 The scales are very close together,
with the result that not even air can get between them.
17 The scales are joined very closely to each other,
and they cannot be separated.
18 When crocodiles sneeze, the tiny drops of water that come out of their noses sparkle
in the sunlight.
Their eyes are red like the rising sun.
19 It is as though sparks of fire pour out of their mouths [DOU].
20 Smoke pours out of their nostrils/noses
like steam comes out of a pot that is put over a fire made from dry reeds.
21 Their breath can cause coals to blaze,
and flames shoot out from their mouths.
22 Their necks are very strong;
wherever they go, they cause people to be very afraid.
23 The folds in their flesh are very close together
and are very hard/firm.
24 They are fearless, because
the inner parts of their bodies are as hard as a rock,
as hard as the lower millstone on which grain is ground.
25 When they rise up, they cause even very strong people to be terrified.
As a result, people ◄fall back/run away► when crocodiles thrash around.
26 People [PRS] cannot injure them with swords,
and spears or darts or javelins cannot injure them, either.
27 They certainly are not afraid of weapons made of straw or rotten wood,
28 Shooting arrows at them does not cause them to run away.
Hurling stones at them from a sling is like hurling bits of chaff at them.
JOB 41:29
778
JOB 42:10
and they laugh when they hear the whirl/sound of javelins being thrown at them
.
30 Their bellies are covered with scales that are as sharp as broken pieces of pottery.
When they drag themselves through the mud,
their bellies tear up the ground like a plow.
31 They stir up the water and cause it to foam
as they churn/swim through it.
32 As they go through the water, the ◄wakes/trails in the water behind them► glisten.
People who see it would think that the foam in those wakes had become white
hair.
33 There are no creatures on earth that are as fearless as crocodiles.
34 They are the proudest of all the creatures;
it is as though they rule like kings over all the other wild animals.”
42
Job replied to Yahweh
1 Then Job replied to Yahweh. He said,
2 “I know that you can do everything
and that no one can stop you from doing what you want to do.
3 You asked me, ‘◄Who are you, who by speaking ignorantly, question what I plan to
do?/You have no right to question what I plan to do by speaking ignorantly.►’
[RHQ]
It is true that I spoke about things that I did not understand,
things that are very wonderful/marvelous,
and therefore I am not able to know them.
4 You said to me, ‘Listen while I talk to you.
I want to ask you some questions,
so prepare yourself to answer them.’
5 I had heard about you previously,
but now it is as though I have seen you with my own eyes.
6 Therefore I ◄am ashamed of/withdraw► what I said,
and I sit in dust and ashes to show that I am sorry for what I said.”
Yahweh said he disapproved of what Job’s three friends said
7 After Yahweh said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz, “I am angry with you
and your two friends, Bildad and Zophar, because what my servant Job said about
me was right/true, but what you have spoken about me was not right/true.
8 So now you must take to Job seven young bulls and seven rams and kill them and
burn them on the altar as a sacrifice for yourselves. Then Job will pray for you, and
I will do what he requests me to do, and I will forgive you for speaking wrongly about
me. I will not punish you, even though you deserve to be punished, because what
you said about me was not right/true, but what Job said about me was right/true.”
9 So Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar did what Yahweh commanded them to do, and
Yahweh blessed Job again
10 After Job prayed for his three friends, Yahweh healed him and caused him to
become rich again. Yahweh gave him twice as many things as he had before.
JOB 42:11
779
JOB 42:17
11 Then all his brothers and sisters, and all the people who had known him before,
came to his house, and they ate a meal together. They consoled/comforted [DOU] him
because of all the troubles that Yahweh had allowed him to experience.
12 Then Yahweh blessed Job in the second half of his life more than he had blessed
him in the first half of his life. He now acquired/owned 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels,
2,000 oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys.
13 And he also had seven more sons and three more daughters.
14 He named the first daughter Jemimah, he named the second daughter Keziah,
and he named the third daughter Keren-Happuch.
15 In all of Uz land there were no young women who were as beautiful as the
daughters of Job, and Job declared that they would inherit some of his possessions,
just like their brothers would inherit some.
16 After that, Job lived 140 more years. Before he died, he ◄saw/enjoyed being
with► his great-great-grandchildren.
17 He was very old [DOU] when he died.
PSALMS 1:1
780
PSALMS 2:7
This book contains songs that the Israeli people sang. We
call this book
The people God is pleased with
Psalms
1
1 God is pleased with those who do not do what [MET] wicked people advise them to
do,
and who do not imitate the behavior of [MET] sinful people,
and who do not join in with people who ◄ridicule/sneer at► God.
2 Those whom God is pleased with delight in doing the things that he has instructed/
taught us to do.
They read and think about Yahweh’s requirements, day and night.
3 They constantly produce/do things that please God
just like fruit trees that have been planted along the banks of a stream produce
fruit at the right time every year.
Like trees that never wither,
they succeed in everything that they do.
4 But wicked people are not like that!
Wicked people are as worthless as chaff
that is blown away by the wind.
5 Therefore, wicked people ◄will not be acquitted/will be condemned► [LIT] when
God judges people,
and furthermore, sinful people will not even be present when God gathers
righteous people together,
6 because he guides and protects righteous people,
but the path that the wicked walk on leads them to where they will be destroyed/
punished by God forever.
2
1 ◄Why do the leaders of nations rage against God?/It is foolish for the nations to be
angry with God► [RHQ].
◄Why do people plan to rebel against God even though it is in vain?/It is useless
for people to plan to rebel against God► [RHQ]!
2 The kings of the nations prepare to revolt;
the rulers plot together to fight against Yahweh and against his chosen king.
3 They shout, “We should free ourselves from their control [MET];
we should not let them rule over us any longer!”
4 But Yahweh, the one who sits on his throne in heaven, laughs at them;
he ridicules those rulers.
5 Then, because he is angry with them, he rebukes them.
He causes them to be terrified when they realize that he will furiously punish
them.
6 Yahweh says, “I have installed my king on Zion, my sacred hill in Jerusalem.”
7 And his king says, “I will proclaim what Yahweh has decreed.
PSALMS 2:8
781
He said to me, ‘It is as though you are my son;
today I have declared to everyone that it is as though [MET] I am your father.
8 Ask me to give you the nations,
so that they belong to you to rule over them permanently,
and I will give them to you.
Even the most remote nations will be yours.
9 You will defeat them completely [MET];
you will destroy them like people smash a clay pot with an iron rod [SIM].’ ”
10 So then, you kings and other rulers on the earth, act wisely!
12 Bow down humbly before his son!
If you do not do that, Yahweh will be angry,
and he will suddenly get rid of you.
Do not forget that he can very quickly show that he is very angry!
But he is very pleased with all those who request him to protect them [MET].
3
A psalm written by David when he fled from his son Absalom
1 Yahweh, I have many enemies [DOU]!
There are many people who oppose/rebel against me.
2 Many people are saying about me,
“God will certainly not help him!”
(Think about that!)
3 But Yahweh, you are like a shield that protects me [MET].
You greatly honor me, and you encourage me (OR, enable me to triumph over my
enemies) [IDM].
4 I cry out to you, Yahweh,
and you answer me from Zion, your sacred hill.
(Think about that!)
5 At night I lie down and sleep, and I awake in the morning feeling good/refreshed
because you, Yahweh, ◄take care of/protect► me all during the night.
6 There may be thousands of enemy soldiers who surround me,
You insult my enemies by slapping them on their cheeks;
when you strike them, you break their teeth,
with the result that they cannot hurt anyone [MET].
8 Yahweh, you are the one who saves your people from their enemies.
Yahweh, bless your people!
(Think about that!)
PSALMS 4:1

A psalm written by David for the choir director; a psalm to be accompanied by people
playing stringed instruments
1 God, answer me when I pray to you.
You are the one who vindicates me;
Rescue me from things that distress me.
Act mercifully toward me, and listen to me while I pray.
2 How long will you people cause me to be disgraced instead of honoring me [RHQ]?
You people love to falsely accuse me.
3 All those who are loyal to Yahweh,
he has chosen them to belong to him.
Yahweh listens to me when I pray to him.
4 When you people get angry, do not allow your anger to control you and cause you to
sin.
While you lie on your bed,
silently examine what you are thinking.
5 Also, offer to Yahweh the proper sacrifices,
(Think about that!)
and continue trusting in him.
6 Some people ask, “Who will allow good things to happen to us?”
But I say, “Yahweh, continue to act kindly toward us.
I am happier than people who have harvested a great amount of grain and grapes.
8 I can lie down at night and sleep soundly
because I know that you, Yahweh, will keep me safe.”
5
A psalm written by David for the choir director; a psalm to be accompanied by
playing flutes
1 Yahweh, listen to me while I pray!
Pay attention to me when I am groaning because I am suffering very much.
2 You are my King and my God.
When I call to you to ask you to help me, listen to me,
because you are the one to whom I pray.
3 Listen to me when I pray to you each morning,
4 You are not a god who is pleased with wicked people;
you do not ◄associate with/invite into your house► those who do what is evil.
5 You do not allow those who are very proud to come to you to worship you.
You hate all those who do evil things.
6 You get rid of liars,
and you despise those who murder others and those who deceive others.
7 Yahweh, because you love me so much and so faithfully,
I come into your temple.
PSALMS 5:8
783
PSALMS 6:10
I revere you greatly,
and I bow down to worship you at your sacred temple.
8 Yahweh, because you act righteously toward me,
show me what is right for me to do.
Because I have many enemies,
show me clearly what you want me to do.
9 My enemies never say what is true;
they just want to destroy others.
The things that they say [MTY] are as foul as an open grave where a corpse is decaying.
They use their tongues to tell lies.
10 O God, declare that they are guilty [MTY] and punish them.
Cause them to experience the same disasters/troubles that they plan to cause to
happen to others.
Get rid of them because they have committed many sins,
and they have rebelled against you.
11 But cause that all those who go to you to be protected will rejoice;
cause them to sing joyfully to you forever.
Protect those who love you [MTY];
12 Yahweh, you always bless those who act righteously;
6
A psalm written by David for the choir leader, to be accompanied by people playing
stringed instruments
1 Yahweh, do not punish me when you are angry with me;
Do not even rebuke/scold me when you are angry.
2 Yahweh, be kind to me and heal me because I have become weak.
My body [SYN] shakes because I am experiencing much pain.
3 Yahweh, I am greatly distressed.
How long ◄must I endure this/will it be before you help me► [RHQ]?
4 Yahweh, please come and rescue me.
Save me because you faithfully love me.
5 I will not be able to praise you after I die [RHQ];
No one in the place of the dead praises you.
6 I am exhausted/groan from my pain.
At night I cry very much, with the result that my bed and my pillow become wet
from my tears.
7 My tears blur my eyes so much that I cannot see well.
My eyes have become weak because my enemies have caused me to cry constantly.
8 You people who do evil things, get away from me!
9 Yahweh heard me when I was crying and called out to him to help me,
and he will answer my prayer.
10 When that happens, all my enemies will be ashamed,
and they will also be terrified.
They will get away from me and suddenly leave me
PSALMS 7:1
784
PSALMS 7:16
because they will be disgraced.
7
A psalm that David sang to Yahweh because of David’s enemy, Cush
1 Yahweh my God, I come to you to protect me.
Rescue me, save me from all those who are pursuing me in order to harm me.
2 If you do not do that, they will tear me into pieces
like a lion does when it attacks the animals it wants to kill,
and no one will save me from them.
3 Yahweh my God, if I have done anything that is wrong,
4 if I have done evil to some friend who did good things to me,
were my enemies,
Allow them to trample me into the ground
(Think about that!)
6 But Yahweh, because you are very angry with those who pursue me,
arise and attack/defeat my enemies who are furiously/angrily attacking me
Do to them what is just!
7 Gather around you the people of all nations,
and rule them from where you are in heaven [MTY].
8 Yahweh, judge the people of all nations!
And, Yahweh, show that I have done nothing that is wrong.
9 God, you know what every person is thinking,
and because you are righteous, you always do what is just/right.
So now stop evil people from doing wicked deeds,
and defend all of us who are righteous!
10 God, you protect me like a shield protects soldiers [MET];
you protect all those who are righteous in their inner being.
11 You judge everyone correctly,
and every day you punish wicked people.
12 Whenever your enemies do not ◄repent/change their behavior►,
it is as though [MET] you sharpen your sword and put a string on your bow to
get ready to kill them.
13 You are preparing your weapons that kill those whom they strike;
the arrows that you will shoot have flaming tips.
14 Wicked people tell lies,
and they think that they surely will be able to do [MET] the evil things that they
are planning to do
just as surely as a pregnant woman knows that she is going to give birth to a child
[MET].
15 But when they dig a deep pit to trap others,
they themselves will fall into it.
16 They themselves will experience the trouble that they want to cause others to have;
they will hurt themselves by the violent things that they want to do to others.
PSALMS 7:17
785
PSALMS 9:8
17 I praise Yahweh because he always acts righteously/justly;
I sing to praise Yahweh, the one who is much greater than any other god.

A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be accompanied by a stringed
instrument
1 Yahweh, our Lord, people all over the world know that you [MTY] are very great!
2 You have taught little children and infants to praise you;
to be silent.
and see the things that you have made—
the moon and the stars that you have set in place—
4 it is amazing to me that [RHQ] you think about people,
that you are concerned about us humans!
5 You made the angels in heaven to be only a little more important than we are;
you caused us to be like kings [MET] and you gave us splendor and honor [DOU]!
6 You put us in charge of everything that you made;
you gave us authority over all things—
7 the sheep and the cattle,
and even the wild animals,
8 the birds, the fish,
and everything else that swims in the seas.
9 Yahweh, our Lord,
people all over the world know that you [MTY] are very great!
9
A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be sung using the tune ‘The death
of my son’
1 Yahweh, I will praise you with all of my inner being.
I will tell others about all the wonderful things that you have done.
2 I will sing to celebrate what you [MTY], who are much greater than all other gods,
have done.
3 When my enemies realize that you are very powerful,
they stumble, and then they are killed.
4 You sat on your throne to judge people,
and you have judged fairly/justly concerning me.
5 You rebuked the people of other nations
and you have gotten rid of the wicked people;
you have erased their names forever.
6 Our enemies have disappeared;
you destroyed their cities,
and people do not even remember them any more.
7 But Yahweh rules forever.
He judges people while he sits on his throne to judge people,
8 and he will judge all the people in [SYN] the world justly;
he will judge the people of all nations fairly [DOU].
PSALMS 9:9
786
PSALMS 10:4
9 Yahweh will be a refuge for those who are oppressed;
yes, he will be like a shelter for them when they have trouble.
10 Those who know Yahweh [MTY] trust in him;
he never abandons those who come to him ◄for help/to worship him►.
11 Yahweh rules from Zion Hill;
praise him while you sing to him.
Tell the people of all the nations the marvelous things that he has done.
12 He does not forget to punish those who have murdered others;
and he will not ignore people who are crying because they are suffering.
13 Yahweh, be merciful to me!
Look at the ways that my enemies have injured me.
14 I want to live in order that I can praise you at the gates of Jerusalem [MTY]
15 It is as though the wicked people of many nations have dug a pit for me to fall into
but they have fallen into that same pit.
It is as if they spread out a net to catch me [MET],
but their feet have been caught in that same net.
16 Because of what you have done, people know that you decide matters fairly/justly,
but you allow wicked people to be trapped by the same evil things that they
themselves do.
(Think about that!)
and their spirits will go to be with all those who have ◄forgotten about/rejected►
you.
18 But you will not forget those who are needy/poor;
what they confidently expect will certainly happen.
19 Yahweh, arise and judge the wicked people of the nations;
do not allow them to think that because they are strong they will never be
punished.
20 Yahweh, teach them to be terrified about you.
Cause them to know that they are merely human beings.
(Think about that!)
10
1 Yahweh, ◄why are you far away from us?/it seems that you are far away from us.►
[RHQ]
Why do you not pay attention when we have troubles [RHQ]?
2 People who are proud gladly cause poor people to suffer.
So cause what they do to others to happen to them! May they be caught in the
same traps that they set to catch others [MET]!
3 They brag about the evil things that they want to do.
They praise people who seize from others things that do not belong to them, and
they curse you, Yahweh.
4 Wicked people are very proud.
PSALMS 10:5
787
PSALMS 11:2
As a result, they do not ◄seek help from/are not concerned about► God;
they do not even think that God exists.
5 But it seems that they succeed in everything that they do.
They do not think that they will be condemned/punished for their deeds,
and they ◄sneer at/make fun of► their enemies.
6 They think, “Nothing bad will happen to us!
We will never have troubles!”
7 When they talk [MTY], they are always cursing, lying, and threatening to harm
others.
They constantly say [MTY] evil things that show that they are ready to do cruel
things to others.
8 They hide in villages, ready to ◄ambush/suddenly attack► and kill people who ◄are
innocent/have done nothing wrong►.
They constantly search for people who will not be able to ◄resist/ defend
themselves► when they are attacked.
9 They are like [MET] lions that crouch down and hide,
waiting to pounce on their prey.
They are like hunters that catch their prey with a net and then drag it away.
10 Just like helpless animals are crushed,
people who cannot defend themselves are killed because wicked people are very
strong.
11 Wicked people say, “God will not pay any attention to what we do.
His eyes are covered, so he never sees anything.”
12 Yahweh God, arise and help us
And do not forget those who are suffering!
They think, “God will never punish us!”
People who are suffering expect that you will help them;
and you help orphans, also.
15 ◄Break the arms/Destroy the power► of wicked [DOU] people!
Continue to pursue and punish them for the wicked things that they do, until
they stop doing those things.
16 Yahweh, you are our king forever,
but wicked nations will disappear from the earth.
17 You have listened to afflicted/suffering people when they cry out to you.
You hear them when they pray, and you encourage [IDM] them.
18 You show that orphans and oppressed people have not done things that are wrong,
with the result that human beings will not cause people to be terrified any more.
11
A psalm written by David for the choir director
1 I trust that Yahweh will protect [MTY] me.
So do not [RHQ] say to me, “You need to escape/flee to the mountains like birds
do,
2 because wicked people have hidden in the darkness,
PSALMS 11:3
788
PSALMS 13:2
they have pulled back their bowstrings and aimed their arrows
to shoot them at godly/righteous [IDM] people like you.
3 When people are not punished for disobeying the laws,
◄what can righteous people do?/there is not much that righteous people can
do.►” [RHQ]
4 But Yahweh is sitting on his throne in his sacred temple in heaven,
and he [SYN] watches everything that people do.
5 Yahweh examines what righteous people do and what wicked people do,
and he hates those who like to perform violent actions to injure others.
6 He will send down from the sky flaming coals and burning sulfur,
and send scorching hot winds to punish wicked people.
7 Yahweh is righteous and he loves those who act righteously;
righteous people are able to come into his presence.
12
A psalm written by David for the choir director
1 Yahweh, help us!
It seems that people who are loyal to you have all vanished.
2 Everyone tells lies to other people;
they deceive others by ◄flattering them/saying good things about them that they
know are not true►.
3 Yahweh, we wish that you would cut off their tongues
so that they cannot continue to boast.
4 They say, “By telling lies we will get what we want;
we control what we say [MTY], so no one can tell us what we should not do!”
5 But Yahweh replies, “I have seen the violent things that they have done to helpless
people;
and I have heard those people groaning,
so I will arise and rescue the people who are wanting me to help them.”
6 Yahweh, you always do what you have promised to do;
what you have promised is as precious and pure as silver
that has been heated seven times in a furnace to get rid of all the impure material.
7-8 Wicked people strut around proudly,
and people praise them for doing vile/wicked deeds,
from those wicked people.
13
A psalm written by David for the choir director
1 Yahweh, how long will you continue to forget about me [RHQ]?
Will you hide yourself [SYN] from me forever?
2 How long must I endure anguish/worry?
Must I be miserable/sad every day?
How long will my enemies continue to defeat me?
PSALMS 13:3
789
PSALMS 15:4
3 Yahweh my God, look at me and answer me.
Enable me to become strong again [IDM], and do not allow me to die.
4 Do not allow my enemies to boast saying, “We have defeated him!”
Do not allow them to defeat me,
with the result that they will rejoice about it!
5 But I trust that you will faithfully love me;
I will rejoice when you rescue me.
6 Yahweh, you have done many good things for me,
so I will sing to you.
14
A psalm written by David for the choir director
1 Only foolish people say to themselves, “There is no God!”
People who say those things are corrupt/worthless; they do abominable/detestable
deeds;
there is not one of them who does what is good/right.
2 Yahweh looks down from heaven and sees humans;
he looks to see if anyone is very wise,
with the result that he desires to know God.
3 But they are all corrupt/evil;
no one does what is good/right.
4 Will those evil people never learn what God will do to punish them [RHQ]?
They act violently toward Yahweh’s people while eating the food that he provides,
and they never pray to Yahweh.
5 But some day they will become very terrified
because God helps those who act righteously and will punish those who reject him.
6 Those who do evil may prevent helpless people from doing what they plan to do,
but Yahweh protects those helpless people [MET].
7 I wish/desire that Yahweh would come from Jerusalem [MTY] and rescue us Israeli
people!
Yahweh, when you bless your people again,
all of us Israeli people, who are the descendants of Jacob, will rejoice.
A psalm written by David
15
1 Yahweh, who are allowed to enter your Sacred Tent?
Who are allowed to live on your sacred mountain?
2 Only those who always do what is right and do not sin may do that.
They always say what is true
3 and they do not slander others.
They do not do to others things that are wrong,
and they do not say bad things about others.
4 Godly people hate those whom God has rejected,
but they respect those who revere Yahweh.
They do what they have promised to do
PSALMS 15:5
790
PSALMS 17:1
even if it causes them trouble to do that.
5 They lend money to others without charging interest,
and they never accept bribes in order to lie about people who have not done
what is wrong.
Those who do those things will never stop trusting God even if disastrous things
happen to them.
16
A psalm written by David
because I go to you to keep me safe!
2 I said to Yahweh, “You are my Lord;
all the good things that I have come from you.”
3 Your people who live in this land are wonderful;
I delight to be with them.
4 Those who choose to worship other gods will have many things that cause them to
be sad.
I will not join them when they make sacrifices to their gods;
I will not even join them when they speak [MTY] the names of their gods.
5 Yahweh, you are the one whom I have chosen,
and you give me great blessings.
6 Yahweh has given me a wonderful place in which to live;
7 I will praise Yahweh, the one who teaches/disciplines me;
even at night he you put in my mind what is right for me to do.
8 I know that Yahweh is always with me.
He is beside me;
so nothing will ◄perturb me/cause me to be worried►.
9 Therefore I am glad and I [MTY, DOU] rejoice;
I can rest securely
10 because you, Yahweh, will not allow my soul/spirit to remain in the place where
the dead people are;
you will not allow me, your godly one, to stay there.
11 You will show me the road that leads to receiving eternal life,
and you will make me joyful when I am with you.
I will have pleasure forever when I am ◄at your right hand/seated next to you►.
17
A psalm written by David
1 Yahweh, listen to me while I plead with you to act justly toward me.
Hear me while I call out to you to help me.
Pay attention to what I say while I pray
because I am speaking [MTY] honestly/truthfully.
PSALMS 17:2
791
PSALMS 18:2
2 You are the one who is able to declare that I ◄am innocent/have not done anything
that was wrong►
because you see/know that I am telling the truth.
3 You know what I think, even at night;
you have examined what I say and do,
and you know that I have determined to never tell any lies.
4 I have not done like others do;
I have always done what is right [IDM],
and I have not acted cruelly toward others.
5 I have always done what you told me to do [IDM],
I have ◄never failed to do/always done► [LIT] those things.
6 O God, I pray to you because you answer me;
please listen [MTY] to what I am saying.
7 Show me that you faithfully love me.
By your great power [MTY] rescue those who ◄run to/trust in► you to protect
them from their enemies.
8 Protect me as people carefully protect their own eyes;
protect me like birds protect their babies under their wings [MET].
9 Do not allow wicked people to attack me;
my enemies surround me, wanting to kill me.
10 They never pity [IDM] anyone,
and they are always boasting.
11 They have hunted/searched for me and found me.
They surround me, watching for an opportunity to throw me to the ground.
12 They are like lions [SIM] that are ready to tear apart the animals that they capture;
they are like young lions that are hiding, waiting to pounce on their prey.
13 Yahweh, come and ◄oppose/fight against► my enemies and defeat them!
Use your sword to save me from those wicked people!
14 Yahweh, by your power [MTY] rescue me from those people who are interested
only in things here in this world.
But you provide plenty of food for those whom you love dearly;
their children also have many things that their grandchildren will inherit.
15 Yahweh, because I act righteously, I will some day see you [SYN].
When I awake, I will see you face-to-face, and then I will be happy.
18
A psalm written by God’s servant David. He sang it after Yahweh had rescued him
from Saul and his other enemies.
1 Yahweh, I love you, the one who enables me to be strong.
2 Yahweh is like an overhanging rock [DOU, MET] under which I can hide from my
enemies;
he is like a strong fortress, the one who protects me;
he protects me like a shield [MET] protects a soldier;
he is the one to whom I go ◄for refuge/to be protected/safe►,
PSALMS 18:3
792
PSALMS 18:22
and he defends me by his great power [IDM].
3 I called out to Yahweh, who deserves to be praised,
and he rescued me from my enemies.
4 All around me were dangerous situations in which I might be killed [PRS];
it was as though there were huge waves [MET] that almost crashed on me and
killed me.
5 It was as though the place where dead people are had ropes that were wrapped
around me,
or it was as though there was a trap [MET] that would seize and kill me.
6 But when I was very distressed, I called out to Yahweh,
and from his temple he heard me.
He listened to me when I cried out for help.
7 Then the earth quaked/shook strongly [DOU];
the mountains shook very strongly from their centers [DOU]
8 It was as though smoke poured out from his nostrils,
and as though burning coals came out of his mouth.
9 He opened the sky and came down
with a black cloud under his feet.
10 He flew, riding on the back of a creature that had wings,
traveling fast, blown along by the wind.
11 Darkness was all around him like a blanket [MET];
dark clouds, full of moisture, covered him [MET].
12 Hailstones and flashes of lightning were around him;
hail and burning coals fell from the sky.
13 Then Yahweh spoke in a loud voice from the sky,
and his enemies heard his voice that sounded like thunder.
14 He shot his arrows at them and caused them to scatter;
His flashes of lightning caused them to become very confused (OR, to run away).
15 The bottom of the ocean became visible,
and the foundations of the earth were uncovered,
when Yahweh rebuked his enemies
when he snorted.
16 It was as though he reached down from heaven and grabbed me
and pulled me up out of the deep ocean.
17 He rescued me from my strong enemies who hated me;
they were very strong,
with the result that I could not defeat them.
18 When I ◄was distressed/had troubles►, they attacked me,
but Yahweh defended/protected me.
19 He led me to a place where I was safe;
he rescued me because he was pleased with me.
20 Yahweh has rewarded me because I do what is right;
he has blessed me because I ◄am innocent/have not done things that are wrong►.
21 I have obeyed Yahweh’s laws;
I have not abandoned him.
22 My behavior was directed by his rules;
I have not stopped obeying them.
PSALMS 18:23
793
PSALMS 18:43
23 He knows that I have not done what is wrong;
I have kept myself from sinning.
24 So he rewards me because I do what is right;
he knows that I [SYN] have not committed sins.
25 Yahweh, you are faithful to those who faithfully do what you tell them to do;
you always do what is good/right to those who do what you want them to do.
26 You are kind to those who are kind to others,
but you act wisely toward those who ◄act perversely/do bad things►.
27 You save those who are humble,
but you cause those who are proud to be humiliated/ashamed.
28 You give light to my soul/spirit;
you take away the darkness of my soul.
29 You enable me to be strong,
with the result that I can run and attack a line of enemy soldiers;
with your help I can ◄scale/climb up► the walls that surround my enemies’ cities.
30 Everything that Yahweh my God does is perfect.
We can depend on him to do what he promises.
He is like a shield [MET] to protect all those who go to him for refuge.
31 Yahweh is [RHQ] the only one who is God;
only he is like an overhanging rock under which we can be safe.
32 God is the one who enables me to be strong
and who keeps me safe on the roads that I walk on.
33 He enables me to walk swiftly without stumbling,
like a deer walks/runs in the mountains.
34 He teaches me how to use a strong/metal bow
in order that I can use it to fight in battles.
35 Yahweh, you protect and save me with your shield;
you have made me safe by your power [MTY].
I have become ◄strong/a great king► because you have helped me.
36 You have cleared the road for me,
with the result that now I do not slip/stumble.
37 I have pursued my enemies and caught them;
I did not stop until I had defeated/killed them all.
38 When I strike them, they are not able to get up again;
they lie on the ground, defeated.
39 You have enabled me to be strong
enemies’ necks after I captured them and forced them to lie on the ground);
41 They called out for someone to help them,
but no one saved them.
42 I pulverize them,
with the result that they become like [MET] the dust that the wind blows away;
I throw them out like [SIM] people throw dirt out into the streets.
43 You enabled me to defeat those who fought against me,
PSALMS 18:44
794
PSALMS 19:8
and appointed me to be the ruler of many nations;
people whom I did not know about previously are now slaves in my kingdom.
44 When foreigners hear about me,
they ◄cringe/bow low before me► and they obey me.
45 They are no longer courageous,
and from their forts where they were hiding they come to me trembling.
46 Yahweh is alive!
Praise the one who is like an overhanging rock [MET] under which I am safe
Exalt the God who saves me!
47 He enables me to get revenge on my enemies;
he causes me to defeat nations and to rule over them,
48 and he rescues me from my enemies.
He has lifted me up high so that violent men could not reach me and harm me.
49 So I praise him and I tell the nations the great things that he has done.
50 He has enabled me, his king, to powerfully defeat my enemies;
he faithfully loves me, David, the one he has chosen to be king, and he will
faithfully love my descendants forever.
19
A psalm written by David for the choir director
1 When people look at everything that God has placed in the skies, they can see that
he is very great;
they can see the great things that he has created.
2 Day after day it is as though the sun proclaims the glory of God,
and night after night it is as though the moon and stars say that they know that
God made them.
3 They do not really speak;
There is no voice from them for anyone to hear.
and even people who live in the most distant/remote places on earth can know it.
5 it rises each morning like a bridegroom who is happy as he comes out of his bedroom
after his wedding.
It is like a strong athlete who is very eager to start running in a race.
6 The sun rises at one side of the sky and goes across the sky and sets on the other
side,
and nothing can hide from its heat.
7 The instructions that Yahweh has given us are perfect;
they ◄revive us/give us new strength►.
We can be sure that the things that Yahweh has told us will never change,
and by learning them people who have not been previously taught/instructed will
become wise.
8 Yahweh’s laws are fair/just;
when we obey them, we become joyful.
The commands of Yahweh are clear,
and by reading them [PRS] we start to understand how God wants us to behave.
PSALMS 19:9
795
PSALMS 20:8
9 It is good for people to revere Yahweh;
that is something that they will do forever.
What Yahweh has decided is fair,
and it is always right.
10 The things that God has decided are more valuable than gold,
even the finest/purest gold.
They are sweeter than honey
that drips from honeycombs.
11 Furthermore, by reading them I learn what things are good to do and what things
are evil,
and they promise a great reward
to us who obey them.
12 But there is no one who can know all his errors [RHQ];
so Yahweh, forgive me for these things which I do that I do not realize are wrong.
13 Keep me from doing things that I know are wrong;
do not let my sinful desires control me.
If you do that, I will no longer be guilty for committing such sins,
and I will not commit the great sin of rebelling terribly against you.
14 O Yahweh, you are like an overhanging rock [MET] under which I can be safe; you
are the one who protects me.
I hope/desire that the things that I say and what I think will always please you.
20
troubles!
God is the one whom ◄our ancestor Jacob/the Israeli people► worshiped;
I desire that he will protect you [MTY] from being harmed by your enemies.
2 I desire/hope that he will reach out from his sacred temple and help you,
and aid you from where he lives on Zion Hill.
3 I desire/hope that he will accept all the offerings that you give him to be burned on
the altar,
and all your other offerings.
(Think about that!)
4 I want him to give to you what you desire,
and that you will be able to accomplish all that you desire to do.
5 When we hear that you have defeated your enemies, we will shout joyfully.
We will lift up a banner proclaiming that it is God [MTY] who helps us (inc).
I want Yahweh to do for you all that you request him to do.
6 I know now that Yahweh rescues me, the one whom he has chosen to be king.
From his holy place in heaven he will answer me,
and he will save me by his great power [MTY].
7 Some kings trust that because they have chariots they will be able to defeat their
enemies,
and some trust that their horses will enable them to defeat their enemies,
but we will trust in the power [MTY] of Yahweh our God.
8 Some kings will stumble and fall down,
but we will be strong and ◄not be moved/continue standing firm►.
PSALMS 20:9
796
PSALMS 22:1
9 Yahweh, enable me, your king, to defeat our enemies!
Answer us when we call out to you to help us.
21
A psalm written by David for the choir director
1 Yahweh, ◄I, your king am glad/the king is glad► because you have caused me/him
to be strong.
◄I rejoice/he rejoices► greatly because you have rescued me/him from my/his
enemies.
2 You have given me/him the things that I/he [SYN] desired
and you have not refused to do what I requested you to do.
(Think about that!)
3 In answer to my/his prayer, you enabled me/him to succeed and prosper.
You placed a gold crown on my/his head.
4 I/He asked you to enable me/him to live for a long time,
and that is what you gave me/him, a very long [HYP] life.
enemies;
6 You will bless me/him forever,
7 Yahweh, you are God Almighty,
and ◄I trust/the king trusts► in you.
Because you faithfully love me/him,
disastrous things will never happen to me/him.
8 You will enable me/him to capture [MTY] all my/his enemies
and all those who hate me/him.
9 When you appear, you will throw them into a fiery furnace.
Because you are angry with them, you will get rid of them;
the fire will burn them up.
10 You will remove their children from this earth;
their descendants will all disappear.
11 They planned to harm you,
but what they plan will never succeed.
12 You will cause them to run away [IDM]
by shooting arrows at them.
13 Yahweh, show us that you are very strong!
When you do that, while we sing we will praise you because you are very
powerful.
22
A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be sung to the tune ‘Doe of the
Dawn’
1 My God, my God, why have you abandoned/deserted me?
Why do you stay so far from me,
and why do you not hear/help me [RHQ]?
Why do you not hear me when I am groaning?
PSALMS 22:2
797
PSALMS 22:17
2 My God, every day I call to you during the daytime and during the night,
but you do not answer me, so I am not able to sleep.
3 But you are holy.
You sit on your throne as king, and we the people of Israel praise you [PRS].
4 Our ancestors trusted in you.
Because they trusted in you, you rescued them.
They trusted in you, and ◄they were not disappointed/you saved them as you
6 But you have not rescued me
People despise me and consider that I am not a man;
Everyone [HYP] scorns me and despises me.
7 Everyone who sees me [HYP] makes fun of me.
They sneer at me and insult me by shaking their heads at me as though I were an
evil man.
They say,
8 “He trusts in Yahweh,
so Yahweh should save him!
He says that Yahweh is very pleased with him;
if that is so, Yahweh should rescue him!”
9 Why do you not protect me now as you did when I was born?
I was safe even when I was ◄nursing/drinking milk from my mother’s breasts►.
10 It was as though you adopted me right when I was born.
You have ◄been my God/taken care of me► ever since I was born.
11 So, ◄do not stay far from/stay close to► [LIT] me now
because enemies who will cause me much trouble are near me,
and there is no one else who can help me.
12 My enemies surround me like a herd/group of wild bulls.
Fierce people, like those strong bulls that graze on the hills in Bashan area, encircle
me.
13 They are like roaring lions that are attacking the animals that they want to kill
[MET] and eat;
they rush toward me to kill me;
they are like lions that have their mouths open, ready to tear their victims to pieces
[MET].
14 I am completely exhausted [MET],
and all my bones are out of their joints/places.
I no longer expect that God will save me;
that expectation is gone completely, like wax that has melted away.
15 My strength is all dried up [MET]
like a broken piece of a clay jar that has dried in the sun.
I am so thirsty that my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.
O God, I think that you are about to let me die and become dirt!
16 My enemies [MET] surround me like a pack/group of wild dogs.
A group of evil men has encircled me, ready to attack me.
They have already smashed my hands and my feet.
17 I am so weak and thin that my bones can be seen and counted.
PSALMS 22:18
798
PSALMS 23:2
My enemies stare at me and ◄gloat/are happy► about what has happened to me.
18 They looked at the clothes that I was wearing
and gambled to determine which piece each of them would get.
19 O Yahweh, do not stay far away from me!
You who are my source of strength,
come quickly and help me!
20 Rescue me from those who want to kill me with their swords.
Save me from those who are like wild/fierce dogs [MET].
21 Snatch me away from my enemies who are like lions whose jaws are already open,
ready to chew me up
Grab me away from those men who are like wild oxen that attack other animals
with their horns [MET]!
22 But you have saved me, so
I will declare to my fellow Israelis how great you [MTY]
are.
I will praise you among the group of your people gathered togetherto worship
you.
23 You people who have an awesome respect for Yahweh, praise him!
All you who are descended from Jacob, honor Yahweh!
All you Israeli people, revere him!
24 He does not despise or ignore those who are suffering;
he does not hide ◄his face/himself► from them.
He has listened to them when they cried out to him for help.
25 Yahweh, in the great gathering of your people, I will praise you for what you have
done.
In the presence of those who revere you, I will offer the sacrifices that I promised.
26 The poor people whom I have invited to the meal will eat as much as they want.
All who come worship Yahweh will praise him.
I pray that God will enable you all to live a long and happy life!
27 I pray that people in all nations, even in the remote areas, will think about Yahweh
and turn to him,
and that people from all the clans in the world will bow down before him.
28 Because Yahweh is the king!
He rules all the nations.
29 I desire that all the rich people on the earth will bow before him.
Some day they will die,
but I want them to prostrate themselves on the ground in his presence before
they die.
30 People ◄in the future generations/who have not been born yet► will also serve
Yahweh.
Our descendants will be told about what Yahweh has done.
31 People who are not yet born, who will live in future years, will be told how Yahweh
rescued his people.
People will tell them, “Yahweh did it!”
23
PSALMS 23:3
799
PSALMS 24:8
and give me peace;
you are like a shepherd
who leads his sheep to places where there is plenty of green grass for them to eat,
and lets them rest beside streams where the water is flowing slowly.
3 You renew my strength.
in order that I can honor you.
where I might be killed,
I will not be afraid of anything
because you are with me.
You protect me like a shepherd protects his sheep.
He uses his club and his walking stick to protect them from being attacked by wild
animals.
in a place where my enemies can see me.
You joyfully receive me, as people joyfully receive the guests they have invited
by pouring olive oil over their heads.
You have given me very many blessings!
6 I am certain that you will be good to me
and act mercifully toward me
as long as I live;
and then, O Yahweh, I will live in your home in heaven forever.
24
A psalm written by David
1 The earth and everything in it belongs to Yahweh;
all the people in the world belong to him, too,
2 because he caused the ground to be above the water,
above the water that was deep below the surface of the earth.
3 Who will be allowed to go up on Zion Hill in Jerusalem,
in order to stand and worship in Yahweh’s holy temple?
4 Only those whose actions [MTY] and thoughts are pure,
who have not worshiped idols,
and who do not tell lies when they have solemnly promised to tell the truth.
5 ◄They will be blessed by Yahweh/Yahweh will bless them►.
When God judges them, he, who has saved them, will say that they ◄have done
nothing wrong/are without fault►.
6 They are the ones who approach God,
they are the ones who may worship God, the one we Israelis worship.
(Think about that!)
7 Open up [APO] the temple gates
in order that our glorious king may enter!
8 Do you know who the glorious king is?
He is Yahweh, the one who is very strong [DOU];
He is Yahweh, who conquers all his enemies in battles!

A psalm written by David
1 Yahweh, my God,, I give myself to you.
2 I trust in you.
Do not allow my enemies to defeat me,
with the result that I would be ashamed/disgraced.
Do not allow my enemies to defeat/conquer me,
with the result that they would rejoice.
3 Do not allow any of those who trust in you to be disappointed/disgraced.
Cause those who ◄act treacherously toward/ try to deceive► others to be
disappointed/disgraced.
4 Yahweh, show me the way that I should ◄conduct my life/live as you want me to►,
teach me how to act in the manner that you want me to act/behave.
5 Teach me to conduct my life by obeying your truth
because you are my God, the one who saves me.
All the time I trust in you.
6 Yahweh, do not forget how you have acted mercifully to me and have faithfully
loved me;
that is the way that you have acted toward me from long ago.
7 Forgive me for all the sinful things I did and the ways that I rebelled against you
when I was young;
I ask this because you faithfully love your people and do good things for them,
Yahweh, do not forget me!
8 Yahweh is good and fair/just;
therefore he shows sinners ◄how they should conduct their lives/how to live as
you want them to►.
9 He shows humble people what is right for them to do
and teaches them what he wants them to do.
10 He always faithfully loves and does what he has promised
to those who keep his agreement with them and who do what he requires.
11 Yahweh, forgive me for all my sins, which are many,
in order that I may honor you [MTY].
12 To all those who revere you [RHQ],
you show them the ◄right way to conduct their lives/things that they should do►.
13 They will always be prosperous,
and their descendants will continue to live in this land.
14 Yahweh is a friend of those who have an awesome respect for him,

and he rescues me from danger [MET].

16 Yahweh, pay attention to me and be merciful to me, because I am alone,
17 Help me to not worry,
and rescue me from my troubles.
18 Note that I am distressed and troubled [DOU],
and forgive me for all my sins.
19 Also note that I have many enemies,
see that they hate me very much.
20 Protect me, and rescue me from them;
do not allow them to defeat me,

8 Yahweh, I love to be in the temple where you live,
9 Do not get rid of me like you get rid of sinners;
do not cause me to die like you cause those who murder [MTY] people to die,
10 and people who [SYN] are ready to do wicked things
and people who are always taking bribes.
11 But as for me, I always try to do what is right.
So be kind to me and rescue me.

PSALMS 28:1
1 Yahweh is the one who gives light to my soul/spirit and the one who saves me,
so I do not [RHQ] need to be afraid of anyone.
Yahweh is the one to whom I go for refuge,
so I will never be afraid.
2 When those who do evil come near me to attack me,
they stumble and fall down.
3 Even if an army surrounds me,
I [SYN] will not be afraid.
Even if they attack me,
I will trust in God.
4 There is one thing that I have requested from Yahweh;
this is the one thing that I desire:
That I may worship in Yahweh’s house/temple every day of my life,
and inquire what he wants me to do.
he will keep me safe in his Sacred Tent.
He will set me safely ◄on a high rock/in a secure place►.
6 Then I will triumph over [IDM] my enemies.
I will shout joyfully as I offer sacrifices in his Sacred Tent,
and I will praise Yahweh as I sing.
7 Yahweh, listen to me while I pray.
Be kind to me and answer my prayer.
8 I sensed that I heard you say, “Come and worship me [IDM],”
so, Yahweh, I will worship you.
9 I am your servant;
Do not be angry with me and turn away from me.
You have always helped me.
You are the one who has saved me,
so do not abandon me now.
10 Even if my father and mother desert me,
you will take care of [IDM] me.
11 Yahweh, teach me to do what you want me to do,
and lead me on a safe path
because I have many enemies.
12 Do not allow my enemies to do to me what they want;
they say many false things about me and threaten to do violent things to me.
13 But I know that because I trust in you
you will be good to me as long as I live.
14 So trust in Yahweh, all of you!
Be strong and courageous,

when I pray, lifting up my hands as I face your sacred temple.
with those who pretend to act peacefully toward others
4 Punish those people in the way that they deserve for what they have done;
punish them for their evil deeds [DOU].
5 Yahweh, they do not pay attention to the wonderful things that you have done and
that you have created;
so get rid of them permanently and do not let them appear again!
6 Praise Yahweh
because he has heard me when I called out for him to help me!
7 Yahweh makes me strong and protects me like a shield [MET];
I trusted in him, and he helped me.
I was glad,

Praise him because he is very glorious and powerful.

bow down before Yahweh in his holy temple.
3 Yahweh’s voice is heard above the oceans;
Yahweh, the glorious God, thunders.
His voice thunders over the huge oceans [DOU].
4 His voice is powerful and majestic.
5 The sound of Yahweh’s voice breaks great cedar trees,
the cedars that grow in Lebanon.
6 He causes the mountains in Lebanon to jump like calves jump,
and causes Hermon Mountain to jump like a young bull jumps.
7 Yahweh’s voice causes lightning to flash.
8 His voice causes the desert to shake;
he shakes Kadesh Desert in the southern part of Judah.

A psalm written by David for the dedication of the temple
1 Yahweh, I praise you because you rescued me.
You did not allow me to die,
with the result that my enemies could gloat/rejoice.
2 Yahweh, my God, I called out for you to help me when I was ill,
and you healed me.
3 You saved/restored me when I was dying [MTY].
I was nearly dead,
but you caused me to get well again.
4 All you who belong to Yahweh, sing praise to him!
Think about what God, the holy one, has done, and thank him!
5 When he becomes angry, he is angry for only a very short time [HYP],
but he is good to us all of our life.
We may cry during the night,
but the next morning we will be joyful.
6 As for me, when I had no troubles, I said to myself,
“No one will defeat me!”
7 Yahweh, because you were good to me,
at first you caused me to be safe as though I was inside [MET] a mountain.
But then I became ill, and I thought that you had turned away from me,
and I became afraid.
8 Then I called out to you,
and I pleaded for you to help me.
9 I said, “Yahweh, ◄what will you gain if I die?/ you won’t gain anything if I die►
[MTY].
the dead people are [RHQ].
and they are not able to tell others that you are trustworthy [RHQ]!
Yahweh, help me!”
You have taken away the clothes that showed that I was very sad
and you have given me clothes that showed that I was very joyful.
12 So I will not be silent;
I will sing out loudly to praise you.
Yahweh, you are my God,
and I will thank you forever.

A psalm written by David for the choir director
1 Yahweh, I have come to you to be protected;
do not allow me to be defeated, with the result that I am disgraced.
Since you always do what is fair/right,
rescue me!
2 Listen to me, and save me right now!
Be like a huge rock under which I can hide [MET]
and like a strong fort in which I will be safe.
3 Yes, you are like my huge rock and my fort;
guide me and lead me [DOU] in order that I can honor you [MTY].
4 You are the one who protects me,
so keep me from falling into the hidden traps that my enemies have set for me.
5 Yahweh, you are a God who can be trusted,
so I put myself into your care
because you rescued me.
6 Yahweh, I hate those who worship useless idols,
but I trust in you.
7 I will be very glad [DOU] because you faithfully love me.
You see me when I have been afflicted,
and you have known when I have had troubles.
8 You have not allowed my enemies to capture me;
instead, you have rescued me from danger.
9 But now, Yahweh, be kind to me again
because I am distressed.
Because I cry so much, I cannot see well,
and I am completely exhausted.
10 I have become very weak because I am so miserable,
and it is causing my life to become shorter.
I have become weak because of all my troubles;
even my bones are becoming weaker.
11 All of my enemies make fun of me,
and even my neighbors despise me.
Even my friends are afraid of me because they think I am being punished by God,
and when they see me on the streets, they run away.
12 People have forgotten me like they forget people who are dead.
They think I am as useless as a broken pot.
13 I have heard people slandering me,
and they have caused me to become terrified.
My enemies are making plans
in order to kill me.
14 But Yahweh, I trust in you.
You are my God.
15 My whole life [MTY] is in your hands;
save me from my enemies,
from those who pursue me.
16 Be kind to me
and rescue me because you always faithfully love me.
PSALMS 31:17
806
PSALMS 32:5
17 Yahweh, I call out to you,
so do not allow me to be disgraced.
I desire that wicked people will be disgraced;
I want them to soon die and go down to the place where the dead people are.
18 I desire that you will cause people [MTY] who tell lies to be unable to speak.
people.
everyone sees you doing that.
20 You hide people in your presence where it is safe,
and protect them from people who plot to kill them.
You hide them in safe places from their enemies [MTY] who accuse/insult them.
21 Praise Yahweh!
When my enemies surrounded the city in which I was living,
he showed me in a wonderful way that he faithfully loves me.
22 I was afraid, and I cried out, “I have been separated from Yahweh!”
but you heard me and answered my cry for help.
23 You people who belong to Yahweh, love him!
Those who are loyal to him, he protects,
but those who are very proud, he punishes them severely like they deserve to be
punished.
be strong, be courageous!
32
A psalm written by David, a psalm which will help people to be wise
1 Those whom God has forgiven for rebelling against him,
whose stains [MET] of sin have been wiped away,
are truly blessed by God!
2 Those whose record of their sins Yahweh has erased,
those who no longer do deceitful things,
are truly blessed by God!
3 When I did not confess my sins,
◄my body/I► was very weak and sick,
and I groaned ◄all day long/continually►.
4 Day and night, Yahweh, you [SYN] punished me severely.
My strength drained away like water that ◄evaporates/dries up► on a hot summer
day.
(Think about that!)
5 Then/Finally I admitted/confessed my sins to you;
I stopped trying to hide them.
(Think about that!)
I said to myself,
“I will confess to Yahweh the wrong things that I have done.”
And when I confessed them, you forgave me,
PSALMS 32:6
807
PSALMS 33:12
so now I ◄am no longer guilty/will no longer be punished► for my sins.
6 Therefore, the people who are godly should pray to you
when they ◄realize that they have sinned/have difficulties►.
If they pray to you, difficulties [MET] will not overwhelm them like a great flood.
7 You are like a place where I can hide from my enemies [MET],
you protect me from troubles,
and you ◄enable me/put people around me who will enable me► to shout, praising
you for saving me from my enemies.
(Think about that!)
8 Yahweh says, “I will teach you about how you should conduct your life.
I will instruct you and watch over you.
9 Do not be stupid like horses and mules that do not have understanding;
they need ◄bits/pieces of metal put in their mouths► and ◄bridles/ropes fastened
to their head►
so they will go in the direction you want them to go.”
10 Wicked people will have many troubles that will make them sad,
but those who trust in Yahweh will experience him faithfully loving them all the
time.
11 So, all you righteous people, rejoice about what Yahweh has done for you;
you whose ◄inner beings/lives► are pure, be glad and shout joyfully!
33
1 You righteous people should sing joyfully to Yahweh
because that is what he deserves.
2 Praise Yahweh as you play songs on the lyre/harp.
Praise him as you play other instruments that have many strings.
3 Sing a new song to him;
Play those instruments well, and shout joyfully as you play them!
4 Yahweh always does what he says that he will do;
we can trust that everything that he does is right.
5 He loves everything that we do that is just and right.
People all over the earth can know that Yahweh faithfully loves us.
6 Yahweh created everything in the sky by commanding it.
By what he said [MTY] he created all the stars.
7 He gathered all the water into one huge mass
like someone scoops liquid into a container.
8 Everyone on the earth should revere Yahweh [DOU].
9 When he spoke, the world ◄was created/started to exist►.
Everything started to exist as a result of him commanding it.
10 Yahweh frustrates the things that the pagan nations decide to do.
He prevents them from doing the evil things that they plan to do.
11 But what Yahweh decides to do will last forever.
What he plans to do will never be changed.
12 Yahweh blesses those nations who choose him to be their God;
He is pleased with those whom he has chosen to receive what he has promised.
PSALMS 33:13
808
PSALMS 34:11
13 Yahweh looks down from heaven and sees all us people;
14 from where he rules [MTY], he looks down on all the people who live on the
earth.
15 He formed our inner beings,
and it is not because a soldier is very strong that he is able to defeat his enemy.
17 It is foolish to trust that because horses are very strong
that they will able to win a battle and save their riders.
18 Do not forget that Yahweh watches over those who revere him,
those who confidently expect him to faithfully love them.
19 He saves them [SYN] from dying before they should die
and preserves them when there is a famine.
20 We trust that Yahweh will help us;
he protects us like a shield protects a soldier [MET].
we trust in him because he [MTY] is holy.
22 Yahweh, we pray that you will always faithfully love us
while we confidently expect you to do great things for us.
34
A psalm written by David when he pretended to be insane in front of King Abimelech,
so that the king would send him away
1 I will always thank Yahweh;
I will constantly praise him [MTY].
2 I will boast about what Yahweh has done.
All those who are oppressed/discouraged should hear me and rejoice.
3 Join with me in telling others that Yahweh is great!
You and I should together proclaim how glorious he is!
4 I prayed to Yahweh, and he ◄answered my prayer/did what I asked him to do►;
he rescued me from all those who caused me to be afraid.
5 Those who trust [IDM] that he will help them will be joyful;
◄they will never be disappointed/he will always do for them the things that he
promises► [LIT].
6 I was miserable/helpless, but I called out to Yahweh, and he heard me.
He rescued me from all my troubles.
7 An angel from Yahweh guards those who revere him,
8 Find out for yourself, and you will experience that Yahweh is good to you!
He is very pleased with those who ask him to protect them.
9 All you who belong to him, revere him!
Those who do that will always have the things that they need [LIT].
10 Lions are usually very strong, but sometimes even young lions are hungry and
become weak,
but those who trust in Yahweh will ◄have everything/not lack any good thing►
[LIT] that they need.
11 You ◄who are my students/whom I teach►, come and listen to me,
PSALMS 34:12
809
PSALMS 35:8
and I will teach you how to revere Yahweh.
12 If [RHQ] any of you wants to enjoy life
14 Turn away from doing evil, and do what is good!
Always try hard to enable people to live peacefully with each other.
15 Yahweh [MTY] carefully watches over those who act righteously;
he always responds [MTY] to them when they call to him for help.
16 But Yahweh [SYN] ◄is opposed to/turns away from► those who do what is evil.
And after they die, people will forget them completely.
17 Yahweh hears righteous people when they call out to him;
he rescues them from all their troubles.
18 Yahweh is always ready to help those who are discouraged;
he rescues those who have nothing good to hope for.
19 Righteous people may have many troubles,
but Yahweh rescues them from all those troubles.
20 Yahweh protects them from being harmed;
when their enemies attack them,
they will not break any bones of those righteous people.
21 Wicked people will be killed by their own evil deeds (OR, by people doing to them
the same evil things that the wicked do to others) [PRS],
and Yahweh will punish those who oppose righteous people.
22 Yahweh will save those who serve him.
He will ◄not condemn/forgive► [LIT] those who trust in him.
A psalm written by David
35
1 Yahweh, fight against those who fight against me!
Fight against my enemies when they fight me!
2 Be like a shield [DOU] to protect me
and come to help me!
3 Lift up your spear [DOU] and throw it at those who pursue me!
confused!
5 Send your angel to pursue them,
and as a result cause them to disappear like chaff/straw blown away by the wind!
6 Cause the path on which they run to be dark and slippery
as your angel pursues them!
7 Although I did not do anything wrong to them,
they concealed a deep pit for me to fall into;
they hid a net in which they would catch me.
8 Cause them to suddenly experience disaster!
Cause them to be trapped in their own nets!
PSALMS 35:9
810
PSALMS 35:26
Cause them to fall into the pits that they have dug for me and disappear!
9 Then I will be joyful about what you, Yahweh, have done for me,
I will be glad that you have rescued me.
10 With my whole inner being [SYN] I will say,
“There is no one like Yahweh [RHQ]!
No one else can rescue helpless people from powerful people [RHQ].
No one else can rescue weak and needy people from those who want to rob
them.”
11 People who tell lies stand in court
and falsely accuse me of doing things that I do not know anything about.
12 In return for my doing good things for them, they do evil things to me,
with the result that I feel that I am alone.
13 When they were ill, I showed that I was sad.
I did not eat any food, and I bowed my head as I prayed for them.
14 I mourned and bowed my head as I prayed
as though it was a friend or my mother for whom I was grieving.
15 But when I had troubles, they were all happy about it.
They gathered around to make fun of me.
Strangers struck me,
and they would not stop.
16 Worthless people ridicule me
and snarl at me.
Rescue me from their attacking me;
like [MET] lions that are attacking other animals
I will praise you
and I will thank you in front of all of them.
Do not allow those who hate me when there in no reason to hate me
to ◄smirk/smile happily►!
20 They do not talk peacefully to people;
instead, they seek ways to tell lies about people who are peaceful.
21 They shout at me, to accuse me,
saying, “We saw the wrong things that you did!”
22 Yahweh, you have seen these things, so do not be silent!
Do not stay far from me!
23 Arise, my God, and plead my case in court,
and successfully defend me!
24 Yahweh, my God, because you are righteous,
prove that I am innocent
in order that my enemies will not be able to gloat that I was judged to be guilty.
25 Do not allow them to be able to say to themselves,
“Yes, we have gotten rid of him [IDM] just like we desired!”
26 Cause those who rejoice about my misfortunes
PSALMS 35:27
811
PSALMS 37:2
to be completely defeated and disgraced;
cause those who boast that they are much greater than me
to be disgraced and dishonored!
27 But cause those who desire that I be acquitted
to be happy and shout joyfully,
and cause them to continually say, “Yahweh is great!
He is delighted to cause things to go well for those who serve him.”
28 Then I will proclaim that you act righteously,
and I will praise you all day long.
36
A psalm written for the choir director by David, a man who served God faithfully
1 Wicked people continually desire to sin.
They consider [IDM] that they do not need to revere God.
2 Because they are very proud,
do not think about their sins and hate themselves for it).
they no longer do what is good
4 While they are lying on their beds, they plan to do things to harm others;
they are determined to do things that are not good,
and they never refuse to do what is evil.
5 Yahweh, your faithful love for us reaches as high as the heavens,
you faithfully do what you have promised;
it is as though your doing that extends up to the clouds.
6 Your righteous behavior is as permanent as the highest mountains [MET],
your acting justly will continue as long as the deepest oceans exist.
You take care of people and you take care of animals.
7 God, your faithful love for us is very precious.
You protect us like birds protect their baby birds under their wings [MET].
8 You provide for us plenty of food from the abundant supply [IDM] that you have;
your great blessings for us flow like a river.
9 You are the one who causes everything to live;
your light is what enables us to see.
10 Continue to faithfully love those who have experienced a relationship with you,
and bless those who act righteously/justly.
11 Do not allow proud people [SYN] to attack me,
or allow wicked people to chase me away.
12 Look where evil people have fallen on the ground, defeated;
they were thrown down, and they will never rise again.
A psalm written by David
37
1 Do not be bothered/upset by what wicked people do.
Do not desire to have the things that people who do wrong/evil have,
2 because they will soon disappear, like grass withers in the hot sun and dries up.
Just like some green plants come up but die during the hot summer,
PSALMS 37:3
812
PSALMS 37:17
evil people will soon die also.
3 Trust in Yahweh, and do what is good;
if you do that, you will live safely in the land that he has given you,
and you will live peacefully [MET].
4 Be delighted with all that Yahweh does for you;
5 Commit to Yahweh all the things that you plan to do;
trust in him,
6 He will show as clearly as the sunlight that you ◄are innocent/have done nothing
that is wrong►;
he will show as clearly as the sun at noontime [SIM]
that all the things that you have decided are just.
7 Be quiet in Yahweh’s presence, and wait patiently for him to do what you want him
to do.
Do not be bothered/upset when what evil men do is successful,
when they are able to do the wicked things that they plan.
8 Do not be angry about what wicked people do.
Do not want to punish them yourself.
Do not be envious of such people
because you will only harm yourself if you try to envy them.
9 Some day Yahweh will get rid of wicked people,
but those who trust in Yahweh will live safely in the land that he has given to
them.
10 Soon the wicked will disappear.
If you look for them, they will be gone.
11 But those who are humble will live safely in their land.
They will happily enjoy living peacefully and having the other good things that
Yahweh gives them.
12 Wicked people plan to harm righteous/godly people;
they snarl at them [MET] like wild animals.
13 But Yahweh laughs at them
because he knows that some day [MTY] he will judge and punish the wicked
people.
14 Wicked people pull out their swords/daggers
and they put strings on their bows,
ready to kill people who are poor [DOU]
and to slaughter those who live righteously.
15 But they will be killed by their own swords/daggers,
and their bows will be broken.
16 It is good to be righteous/godly even if you do not have many possessions,
but it is bad to be wicked, even if you are very wealthy,
17 because Yahweh will completely take away the strength of wicked people,
but he will ◄sustain/take care of► people who live righteously.
PSALMS 37:18
19 They will survive when calamities occur;
when there are famines, they will still have plenty to eat.
20 But wicked people will die;
just like the beautiful wild flowers in the fields die under the hot sun and disappear
like smoke [MET],
Yahweh will cause his enemies to suddenly disappear.
21 The wicked people borrow money, but they are not able to repay it;
righteous/ godly people, in contrast, have enough money that they can give
generously to others.
22 Those whom Yahweh has blessed will live safely in the land that he has given to
them,
but he will get rid of those people whom he has cursed.
23 Yahweh protects those who do what is pleasing to him,
and he will enable them to walk confidently, wherever they go;
24 even if they stumble, they will not fall down,
because Yahweh holds them by his hand.
25 I was young previously, and now I am an old man,
but in all those years, I have never seen righteous/godly people being abandoned
by Yahweh,
nor have I seen that their children needed to beg for food.
26 Righteous/Godly people are generous, and happily lend money to others,
and their children are a blessing to them.
27 Turn away from doing evil, and do what is good.
If you do that, you and your descendants will live in your land forever.
28 That will happen because Yahweh likes to see people doing what is just,
and he will never forsake righteous/godly people.
He will protect them forever;
but he will get rid of the children of wicked people.
29 Righteous/Godly people will own the land that Yahweh promised to give to them,
and they will live there forever.
30 Righteous people give wise advice to others,
and they [MTY] say what is just/fair.
31 They continually think about God’s laws;
they do not stray from God’s path.
32 Those who are evil wait in ambush for righteous people
in order to kill them as they walk by.
and allow ◄them to fall into their enemies’ hands/their enemies harm them►.
And he will not allow righteous people to be condemned
when someone takes them to a judge to be put on trial.
PSALMS 37:34
814
PSALMS 38:12
34 Be patient and trust that Yahweh will help you,
and ◄walk on his paths/do what he wants you to do►.
If you do that, he will honor you by giving you the land that he promised,
and when he gets rid of the wicked, you will see it happen.
35 I have seen that wicked people who ◄act like tyrants/terrify people► sometimes
prosper, like trees that grow well in fertile soil,
36 when I looked later, they were gone!
I searched for them, but Yahweh had caused them to disappear.
37 Notice the people who have not done evil things, those who act righteously:
their descendants will have peace in their inner beings.
38 But Yahweh will get rid of the wicked;
he will also get rid of their descendants (OR, as a result, they will not have any
descendants).
39 Yahweh rescues righteous people;
in times of trouble he protects them [MET].
40 Yahweh helps them and saves them;
he rescues them from being attacked/harmed by wicked people
because they go to him to be protected [MET].

A psalm written by David, asking God not to forget him
1 Yahweh, when you are angry with me,
do not rebuke/scold me and punish me!
2 Now it is as though you have shot your arrows at me and wounded me;
you have struck me and knocked me down.
3 Because you have been angry with me,
I am suffering great pain.
Because of my sin,
my whole body is diseased.
4 All my sins are like a flood that covers my head;
they are like a load that is very heavy, with the result that I cannot carry it.
5 Because I have done foolish things,
I have sores that have become worse, and they stink.
6 Sometimes I am bent over, and sometimes I lie prostrate;
I am sad/cry all day.
7 My body is burning with fever,
and I am very ill.
9 Yahweh, you know that I desire to be healed;
you hear me while I am groaning.
10 My heat is pounding heavily, and all my strength is gone.
I am no longer able to see well.
11 My friends and neighbors stay away from me because of my sores;
even my own family stays away from me.
12 And those who want to kill me set traps to catch me;
PSALMS 38:13
815
PSALMS 39:7
those who want to harm me discuss ways to get rid of me;
they plot against me all day.
13 Now I act like I’m deaf, and do not listen to what they say.
I act like I cannot talk, so I say nothing to reply to them.
14 I act like a man who does not answer when people talk to him,
because he cannot hear anything.
15 But Yahweh, I trust in you.
My Lord God, you will answer me.
16 I said to you, “Do not cause me to die, with the result that my enemies will rejoice!
Do not cause me to stumble, with the result that they will be very happy!”
17 I say that because I am about to fall down,
and I constantly have pain.
18 I confess the wrong things that I have done;
I am very sorry for the sins that I have committed.
19 My enemies are healthy and strong;
there are many people who hate me for no reason.
20 Those who do evil things to me in return for my doing good things to them
oppose me because I try to do what is right.
21 Yahweh, do not abandon me!
My God, do not stay far from me!
22 Lord, you are the one who saves/rescues me;
Quickly come and help me!
A psalm written by David for Jeduthun, the choir director
1 I said to myself, “I will be careful not to sin by the things that I say [MTY].
I will not say anything to complain
while wicked people are near to me and can hear me.”
2 So I was completely silent [DOU], and I did not even talk about things that were
good,
but it was useless, because I began to suffer even more.
3 I became very anxious/worried [IDM].
As I thought about my troubles, I became more worried.
Then finally I said [MTY],
4 “Yahweh, show/tell me how long I will live.
Tell me when I will die.
Tell me how many years I will live!
5 It seems that you have caused me to live only a short time;
◄my lifetime/all the time that I have lived► seems like nothing to you.
The time that all we humans live is as short as [MET] a puff of wind.
(Think about that!)
6 Then we disappear like a shadow does.
It seems that all that we do is for nothing/useless.
We sometimes get a lot of money, but we do not know who will get it after we die.
7 So now, Yahweh, if I expect [RHQ] to receive blessings from other people, I will be
disappointed.
PSALMS 39:8
816
PSALMS 40:7
You are the only one from whom I confidently expect to receive blessings.
8 Save me from being punished for all the sins that I have committed.
And do not allow foolish people to make fun of me.
9 I did not say anything when you punished me,
because I knew that you were the one who caused me to suffer.
10 But now, please stop punishing me!
If you do not do that, I am about to die because of the ways that you [SYN] have
struck/afflicted me.
11 When you rebuke someone and punish him for the sin that he has committed,
you destroy the things that ◄he loves/are precious to him►, like moths’ larva
destroy clothing.
Our lives disappear like a puff of wind.
(Think about that!)
12 Yahweh, listen to me while I pray;
pay attention to me while I cry out to you.
Help me while I am crying.
I am here on the earth for only a short time,
13 Now please leave me alone, and do not punish me any more
40
A psalm written by David for the choir director
1 I waited patiently for Yahweh to help me,
and he listened to me [DOU] when I called out to him.
2 When I had many troubles, it was as though I was in a deep pit.
But he lifted me up out of the mud and slime of that pit;
he set my feet on a solid rock,
and enabled me to walk ◄safely/without falling►.
3 He has given me a new song to sing,
a song to praise him who is our God.
Many people will find out what he has done for me,
and they will revere and trust him.
4 Yahweh is pleased with those who trust him,
those who do not trust in idols
or join with those who worship those false gods.
5 O Yahweh, my God, you have done many wonderful things!
No one can list all the wonderful things that you have planned for us.
If I tried to tell others about all those wonderful things,
I would not be able to,
because there would be too many for me to mention.
6 Various kinds of sacrifices and other offerings are not the only things that delight
you.
You have enabled me to understand that very well [IDM].
Animals burned on the altar and other offerings
are not all that you require for sins to be forgiven.
7 So I said to you, “Yahweh, here I am,
to do the things that have been written in the scroll that contains your laws,
PSALMS 40:8
817
PSALMS 41:5
things that you want me to do.”
8 O my God, I delight to do what you desire;
I keep your laws within my inner being.
9 Whenever all your people are gathered,
I have told them about how you save us.
Yahweh, you know that I have not been afraid to tell that to them.
when many of your people have gathered together to worship you in the temple,
I have ◄not concealed/openly told people► that you faithfully love us and act
11 Yahweh, do not stop being merciful to me.
Because you faithfully love me [PRS] and are loyal to me, always protect me.
12 I have many troubles; so many that I cannot count them.
My sins are like a flood that has covered me [PRS, MET];
they are so many that I cannot find my way.
The sins that I have committed are more than the hairs on my head.
I am very discouraged.
13 O Yahweh, please save me!
Come quickly to help me!
14 Humble those who are happy about my troubles, and cause them to be disgraced
and ashamed.
Chase away those who are trying to get rid of me.
15 I hope/desire that those who make fun of me
will be dismayed when you defeat them.
16 But I hope that all those who go to worship you will be very joyful [DOU].
I want those who love you because you saved them to shout repeatedly,
“Yahweh is great!”
17 As for me, I am poor and needy [DOU];
but I know that Yahweh has not forgotten me.
O my God, you are the one who saves and helps me,
so please come quickly and help me!
A psalm written by David for the choir director
1 Yahweh is pleased with those people who help to provide for the poor;
he will rescue those people when they have troubles.
2 Yahweh protects them and allows them to live for a long time.
He enables them to be happy in the land of Israel,
and rescues them from their enemies.
3 When they are sick, Yahweh strengthens them,
and he heals them.
4 When I was sick, I said, “Yahweh, be merciful to me and heal me;
I know that I am sick because I have sinned against you.”
5 My enemies say cruel things about me;
PSALMS 41:6
818
PSALMS 42:5
they say, “How soon will he die, and then everyone will forget about him [MTY]?
(OR, he will not have any descendants to continue his name).”
6 When my enemies come to me, they falsely say that they are concerned about me.
They listen to bad news about ◄me/my health►.
Then they go away and tell everywhere what is happening to me.
7 All those who hate me whisper to others about me,
and they hope/desire that very bad things will happen to me.
8 They say, “He will soon die because of his being sick;
he will never get up from his bed before he dies.”
9 Even my best friend, whom I trusted very much,
who often ate with me,
has ◄betrayed me/put me into my enemies’ hands► [IDM].
10 But Yahweh, be merciful to me, and enable me to become healthy again.
When you do that, I will be able to ◄pay back my enemies/get revenge on my
enemies/cause my enemies to suffer like they caused me to suffer►.
11 If you enable me to do that, with the result that my enemies do not defeat me,
I will know that you are pleased with me.
12 I will know that it is because I have done what is right that you have helped me,
and I will know that you will let me be with you forever.
13 Praise Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship;
Praise him forever!
Amen! I desire that it will be so!
Book Two
42
A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah for the choir director
1 Deer pant, desiring to drink water from a stream when there is a drought (OR, when
they are being pursued by hunters.)
In the same way [SIM], God, I need you very much.
2 I desire to have fellowship with [MET] you, the all-powerful God.
I wonder, “When will I be able to go back to the temple in Israel
and worship in your presence again?”
3 Every day and every night I cry;
it is as though the only thing I have to drink is my tears;
and while I do that, my enemies are continually asking me,
“Why does your god not help you?”
4 I am very distressed [IDM] as I remember
leading them as we walked along;
we were a large group who were celebrating.
5 So I say to myself, “◄Why am I sad and discouraged?/I should not be sad and
discouraged!► [RHQ]
and again I will praise him,
my God, the one who saves me.”
PSALMS 42:6
819
PSALMS 43:5
6 But now, Yahweh, I am very discouraged [IDM],
so I think about you,
even from where the Jordan River gushes out from the bottom of Hermon Mountain
and from Mizar Mountain.
7 But here, the great sorrow that I feel is like water that you send down [MET];
it is like a waterfall that tumbles down and floods over me.
8 Yahweh shows me each day that he faithfully loves me,
and each night I sing to him
and pray to him, the God who causes me to live.
9 I say to God, who is like an overhanging rock under which I can hide [MET],
“It seems that you have forgotten me.
I <mourn/cry> constantly because my enemies act cruelly toward me” [RHQ].
10 They make fun of me constantly;
they continually ask, “Why does your god not help you?” [RHQ]
And when they insult me like that,
it is like wounds that I feel even in my bones.
11 But I think,
“◄Why am I sad and discouraged?/I should not be sad and discouraged!► [RHQ]
I will confidently expect God to help me,
and I will praise him again,
my God, the one who saves me.”
(A continuation of psalm 42)
43
1 God, declare that I ◄am innocent/have not done things that are wrong►.
Defend me when ◄ungodly people/ people who do not worship you► say things
against me,
rescue me from people who deceive and say things about me that are not true.
2 You are God, the one who protects me;
◄why have you abandoned me?/it seems that you have abandoned me!► [RHQ]
It does not seem right that [RHQ] I am forced to mourn/cry constantly
because my enemies are cruel to me.
3 Shine your light on me and speak your truth to me;
and let them guide me,
and take me back to Zion, your sacred hill at Jerusalem,
and to your temple, where you live.
4 When you do that, I will go to your altar,
to worship you, my God, who causes me to be extremely joyful.
There I will praise you, the God whom I worship, while I play my harp.
5 So ◄why am I sad and discouraged?/I should not be sad and discouraged!► [RHQ]
I confidently expect God to bless me,
and I will praise him again,
my God, the one who saves me.
44
A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah for the choir director
PSALMS 44:1
820
PSALMS 44:18
1 God, we ourselves have heard
what our parents and grandparents told us.
They told us about the miracles
that you performed long ago.
2 They told us how you expelled the ungodly people
and enabled us to live in their land.
They told us that you punished those ungodly people
and enabled your own people to prosper [IDM].
3 It was not by using their own swords that they conquered the people that lived in
and it was not by their own power that they were victorious;
and they were sure that you were with them,
4 You are my King and my God;
it is you who enable us, your people [MTY], to defeat our enemies.
5 It is by your power that we knock our enemies down and tramp on them.
6 I do not trust that I will be saved
by using my bow and arrows and my sword.
7 No, it is you who have rescued us from our enemies,
it is you who have caused those who hate us to become ashamed because they
were defeated.
8 We have continually boasted about what God has done for us,
and we will thank him [MTY] forever.
(Think about that!)
9 But now you have rejected us and caused us to be disgraced;
when our armies march out to fight a battle, you no longer go with them.
10 You have caused us to run away from our enemies,
with the result that they captured the things that belonged to us.
11 You have allowed us to become like [MET] sheep that were ready to be slaughtered;
you scattered us far away among other nations.
12 It is as though [MET] you sold us, your people, to our enemies for a very small price,
and you did not gain much profit from selling us!
13 People who live in nations near us make fun of us;
they laugh at us and deride/belittle us.
14 They make jokes using the name of our country,
they shake their heads to indicate that they despise us.
15 All day I feel disgraced;
from seeing my face, people know that I am ashamed.
16 I hear what those who sneer at me and revile me say;
I am ashamed in front of my enemies and those who want to harm me.
17 All these things have happened to us
even though we have not forgotten you,
and we are not the ones who disobeyed the agreement you made with our
ancestors.
18 We have not stopped being loyal to you,
and we have not stopped doing what you want us to do [IDM].
PSALMS 44:19
821
PSALMS 45:8
19 But it is as though you have allowed us to be helpless among wild animals,
and abandoned us in a deep dark ravine.
20 If we had forgotten to worship [MTY] our God,
or if we had spread out our hands to worship a foreign god,
21 you certainly would have known that,
because you know even what we secretly think.
22 But it is because we belong to you,
that our enemies are constantly killing us.
They act toward us as though we were only sheep to be slaughtered.
23 So, Yahweh, arise! Why are you asleep [RHQ]?
Get up! Do not reject us forever!
24 Why are you not looking at us?
Why are you forgetting that we are suffering and being oppressed by our enemies?
25 We are pushed down to the ground
and we cannot get up.
26 Arise, and come and help us!
Rescue us because you faithfully love us!
45
A love song written by one of the descendants of Korah, for the choir director, to be
sung to the tune ‘Lilies’
1 In my inner being I am stirred by a beautiful message
which will be sung to the king.
The words of this message will be written with a pen by me, a skilled writer.
2 O King, you are the most handsome man in the world,
and you always speak [MTY] eloquently,
because God has always blessed you.
3 You who are a mighty warrior, put on your sword!
You are glorious and majestic.
to defend the truth that you speak
Because you are strong [MTY],
5 Your arrows are sharp,
and they pierce the hearts of your enemies.
Soldiers of many nations will fall dead at your feet.
6 The kingdom [MTY] that God will give to you will remain forever.
You rule [MTY] people justly.
7 You love right actions,
and you hate evil actions.
Therefore God, your God, has chosen [MTY] you to be king
and caused you to be happier [MET] than any other king.
8 The perfume of various spices is on your robes.
People ◄entertain you/make you happy► in ivory palaces
by playing stringed instruments.
PSALMS 45:9
822
PSALMS 46:6
9 Among the women who stay near you [EUP] stay are daughters of other kings.
And at your right hand stands your bride, the queen, wearing beautiful ornaments
of gold that comes from Ophir.
10 Now I will say something to your bride:
Listen to me carefully [DOU]!
Forget the people who live in your home country,
forget your relatives!
11 Because you are very beautiful,
the king will desire to sleep with [EUP] you.
He is your master, so you must obey him.
12 The people from Tyre city will bring gifts to you;
their rich people will try to persuade you to do favors for them.
13 O king, your bride will be entering the palace
wearing beautiful robes made from gold thread.
14 While she is wearing a gown that has many colors,
her companions will lead her to you.
She will have many other young women who accompany her.
15 They will be very joyful [DOU] as they are led along
to enter your palace.
16 Some day, your sons and your grandsons will become kings,
just like your ancestors were.
You will enable them to become rulers in many countries [HYP].
17 And as for me, I will enable people in every generation to remember the great
things that you [MTY] have done,
A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah for the choir director
1 God is the one who protects us and causes us to be strong;
he is always ready to help us when we have troubles.
2 So, even if the earth shakes,
we will not be afraid.
Even if the mountains fall into the middle of the sea,
3 and if the water in the sea roars and foams,
and the hills shake violently,
we will not be afraid!
(Think about that!)
4 Blessings that come from God are like a river that makes everyone in the city where
we worship God joyful.
It is the city where the temple of God, who is greater than any other god, exists.
5 God is in this city, and it will never be destroyed;
he will come to help the people in that city at dawn every day.
6 Sometimes the people of many nations are terrified;
kingdoms ◄are overthrown/cease to exist►;
God speaks loudly like thunder,
the God whom Jacob worshiped (OR, we Israeli people worship) is our refuge.
8 Come and ◄see/think about► the amazing things that Yahweh has done [DOU]!
9 He stops wars all over the world;
he breaks bows and arrows;
he destroys spears;
he burns up shields.
10 God says, “Be quiet, and remember that I am God!
I will be honored by the people of all nations.
I will be honored all over the earth.”
11 So never forget that Yahweh, the commander of the armies of heaven, is with us;
the God whom Jacob worshiped (OR, we Israeli people worship) is our refuge.
(Think about that!)
47
A psalm written for the choir director by one of the descendants of Korah
1 You people all over the world, clap your hands for joy!
Shout joyfully to praise God!
2 Yahweh, who is much greater than any other god, is awesome;
he is the king who rules over all the world!
3 He enabled us to defeat the armies of the people-groups that lived in Canaan.
4 He chose for us this land where we now live;
we Israeli people [MTY], whom he loves, are proud that we own this land.
(Think about that!)
5 God has gone up into his temple.
The people shouted joyfully and blew trumpets as Yahweh went up.
6 Sing songs to praise our God!
Sing to praise him [DOU]!
sing a psalm to him!
8 God sits on his sacred throne
9 The rulers of those people-groups gather as God’s people, the people descended from
Abraham, do.
But God has more power than the weapons/shields of all the kings on the earth;
◄he is greatly honored/people honor him► everywhere.
48
A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah
1 Yahweh is great, and he deserves to be greatly praised in the city where he lives,
which is built on Zion, his sacred hill.
2 That city, on a high hill, is beautiful;
it is the city where the true God, the great king, lives,
and it causes people all over the world to rejoice when they see it.
3 God is in the strong towers there,
PSALMS 48:4
824
PSALMS 49:8
and he shows that he protects the people in that city.
5 but when they saw it, they were amazed;
they became terrified, and ran away.
6 Because they were very afraid, they trembled
like a woman who is about to give birth to a child;
7 they shook like ships sailing from Tarshish are shaken by a strong wind.
8 We had heard that this city is glorious,
and now we have seen that it is.
It is the city in which Yahweh, the almighty one, lives.
It is the city which God will preserve/protect forever.
(Think about that!)
9 God, here in your temple we think about how you faithfully love us.
10 You [MTY] are famous and ◄are praised/people praise you► all over the earth,
because you rule powerfully [MTY] and justly.
11 The people who live near Zion Hill should be happy!
The people in all the cities [MTY] in Judah should rejoice
12 You Israeli people should walk around Zion Hill
and count the towers there;
13 notice the walls there and examine the forts
in order that you can tell about them to your children.
14 Say to them, “This is the city that belongs to our God, the one who lives forever;
he will guide us all of our lives.”
49
A psalm written for the choir director by one of the descendants of Korah
1 You people of all ethnic groups, listen!
You people all over the world,
2 important people and unimportant people,
rich people and poor people,
everyone, listen to what I am saying,
3 because what I am thinking is very sensible,
and what I say will enable you to become wise!
4 I think about [MTY] ◄proverbs/wise sayings►,
and while I play my harp, I explain what they mean.
5 I am not [RHQ] afraid when I am in trouble/danger,
when I am surrounded by my enemies,
6 by evil men who trust that things will always go well for them because they are
wealthy,
and who boast about being very rich.
7 They may be rich, but no one can pay money
with the result that he would live forever!
No one can pay God enough so that God will allow him to continue to live,
8 because that cost is too great,
and he will never be able to pay enough
PSALMS 49:9
825
PSALMS 50:4
9 with the result that he will live forever
and never die and be buried!
10 We see that foolish and stupid people die,
but we see that wise people also die;
they all leave their wealth, and others inherit it.
but now their graves are their homes forever,
12 Even if people are great, that cannot prevent them from dying;
all people die, the same as animals do.
13 That is what happens to those who foolishly trust in what they have accomplished,
to those who are delighted in all that they possess.
14 They are certain to die just like sheep,
(Think about that!)
when a shepherd leads them away to be slaughtered. [PRS, MET]
In the morning righteous people will rule over them,
and then those wealthy people will die and their bodies will quickly decay in their
graves;
they will be where dead people are, far from their homes.
15 But it is certain that God will rescue me
so that I am not kept in the place of the dead.
(Think about that!)
16 So, do not be dismayed when someone becomes rich
and the houses where they live become more and more luxurious,
17 because when he dies, he will take nothing with him;
his wealth will not go with him.
18 While a rich person is alive, he congratulates himself,
and people praise him for being successful,
19 but he will die, joining his ancestors,
who will never see daylight again.
20 Even if someone is great, that cannot prevent him from dying;
he will die, the same as animals do.
A psalm written by Asaph
1 God, the all-powerful one, speaks;
50
he summons all people,
from the east to the west.
2 His glory shines from Zion Hill in Jerusalem,
an extremely beautiful city.
3 Our God comes to us,
and he is not silent.
A great fire is in front of him,
and a storm is around him.
4 He comes to judge his people.
He shouts to the angels in heaven
and to the people on the earth.
PSALMS 50:5
826
PSALMS 50:23
5 He says, “Summon those who faithfully worship me,
those who made an agreement with me by offering sacrifices to me.”
6 The angels in heaven declare,
“God is righteous,
and he is the supreme judge.”
(Think about that!)
7 God says, “My people, listen!
You Israeli people, listen,
as I, your God, say what you have done that is wrong.
8 I am not rebuking you for making sacrifices to me,
for the offerings that you completely burn on the altar.
9 But I do not really need you to sacrifice
the bulls from your barns and the goats from your pens,
10 because all the animals in the forest belong to me,
and all the cattle on 1,000 hills also belong to me.
11 I own and know all the birds
and all the creatures that move around in the fields.
12 So, if I were hungry, I would not tell you to bring me some food,
because everything in the world belongs to me!
13 I do not eat the flesh of the bulls that you sacrifice,
and I do not drink the blood of the goats that you offer to me.
14 The sacrifice that I really want is that you thank me
and do all that you have promised to do.
15 And pray to me when you have troubles.
If you do that, I will rescue you, and then you will praise me.
16 But I say this to the wicked people:
◄Why do you/It does not benefit you at all to► [RHQ] recite my commandments
or talk about the agreement that I made with you,
17 because you have refused to allow me to discipline you,
and you have rejected what I told you to do.
18 Every time that you see a thief, you become his friend,
and you spend much time with those who commit adultery.
19 You are always talking [MTY] about doing wicked things,
and you are always trying to deceive people.
20 You are always accusing members of your own family of doing wrong,
and slandering them.
so you thought that I was a sinner just like you.
22 So, all you who have ignored me, pay attention to this,
because if you do not, I will tear you to pieces,
and there will be no one to rescue you.
23 The sacrifice that truly honors me is to thank me for what I have done;
and I will save those who always do the things that I want them to.”

A psalm written by David for the choir director, concerning the time when the prophet
Nathan rebuked David after he had committed adultery with Bathsheba
PSALMS 51:1
827
PSALMS 51:18
1 O God, be merciful to me,
because you love me faithfully;
because you are very merciful,
erase the record of the ways that I disobeyed you!
2 Make me pure from the wrong things that I have done;
make me clean from the guilt of my sin.
3 I say that because I know the ways that I have disobeyed you;
I cannot forget them.
4 You, you only, are the one that I have really sinned against,
and you have seen the evil things that I have done.
When you say that I am guilty, you are right/correct,
and when you judge me, you justly say that I deserve to be punished.
5 I have been a sinner since the day that I was born;
truly, I have been like that since my mother conceived me.
6 What you desire is that I desire what is true
in order that you can teach me how to act wisely.
7 Purify me from the guilt of my sins, and after that happens, I will be clean in my
inner being;
cleanse me, and then in my inner being I will be ◄whiter than snow/very clean►.
8 Allow/Cause me to be joyful [DOU] again;
you have ◄crushed my spirit/completely discouraged me► [MTY];
but now let me rejoice again.
erase the record of the evil things that I have done.
and do not take your Holy Spirit from me.
12 Cause/Allow me to be happy again because of knowing that you have freed me from
the guilt of my sin,
and make me willing to obey you.
13 If you do that, I will be able to teach other sinners what you want them to do,
and they will repent and begin to obey you.
14 O God, you are the one who saves me;
forgive me for being guilty of causing someone who was not my enemy to die.
When you do that, I will sing joyfully about your being very good and righteous.
15 O Yahweh, help me to speak
in order that I may praise you.
16 You are not pleased only with the sacrifices that people bring to you.
If that were enough to please you, I would bring you sacrifices.
You are not pleased with burnt offerings alone.
17 The sacrifice that you really want is for people to be truly humble and sorry for
having sinned;
O God, you will not refuse that kind of sacrifice.
18 O God, be good to the people who live in Jerusalem [MTY],
PSALMS 51:19
828
PSALMS 53:3
and help them to rebuild the city walls.
19 When that happens, they will bring you the proper sacrifices,
animals that they will completely burn,
young bulls that they will burn on your altar,
A psalm written by David for the choir director, when Doeg went to Saul and said,
“David has gone to talk with Ahimelech, the Supreme Priest”
1 You people think that you are strong
and brag about the sins that you have committed,
while you plan to harm godly people.
2 All during the day you plan to get rid of others;
what you say [MTY] injures others like a sharp razor [SIM],
and you are always deceiving others.
3 You like doing what is evil more than you like doing what is good,
and you like telling lies more than you like telling the truth.
(Think about that!)
you like to say ◄things that hurt people/cruel things►!
and take you away from this world where people are alive.
6 When righteous people see that, they will be awestruck,
(Think about that!)
and they will laugh at what happened to you, and say,
7 “Look what happened to the man who would not ask God to protect him;
he trusted that his great wealth would save him;
he trusted in the money that he got by wickedly taking it from others!”
8 But I am secure/safe because I worship in God’s temple;
I am like a strong green olive tree.
I trust in God, who faithfully loves us forever.
9 God, I will always thank you for the things that you have done.
As I stand before godly people, I will proclaim that you are good (OR, the many
good [MTY] things you have done for us).
53
A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be sung using a tune called
‘Mahalath’
1 Only foolish people say to themselves, “There is no God!”
People who say that are corrupt; they commit terrible sins;
there is not one of them who does what is good/right.
2 God looks down from heaven and sees humans;
he looks to see if anyone is very wise,
with the result that he seeks to know God.
3 But they are all morally corrupt;
PSALMS 53:4
829
PSALMS 55:3
no one does what is good/right.
4 Will all these evil people never learn what God will do to them?
They act violently toward Yahweh’s people while eating the food that he provides,
and they never pray to Yahweh.
5 But some day those people will become terrified,
like they have never been terrified before,
because God will cause those who are separated from him to die,
and he will disrespect them by scattering their bones.
They have rejected God,
so he will cause them to be defeated and completely disgraced.
6 I wish/desire that someone from Jerusalem [MTY] would come and rescue the Israeli
people!
God, when you bless your people again,
all the Israeli people, all the descendants of Jacob, will rejoice.
54
A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be accompanied by stringed
instruments; it was written when the people of Ziph went to Saul and told him that
David was hiding in their area
1 God, by your power [MTY, DOU] save me from my enemies,
and show people that I have not done anything that is wrong!
2 God, listen to my prayer;
listen to what I say to you,
3 because strangers are trying to attack me;
proud men are wanting to kill me;
men who do not have any ◄respect for/interest in► you.
(Think about that!)
4 But God is the one who helps me;
Yahweh defends/protects me from my enemies.
5 He will cause the evil things that they want to do to me to happen to them instead;
because he faithfully does what he promises, he will get rid of them.
6 Yahweh, I will gladly give an offering to you because I want to,
7 you have rescued me from all my troubles,
and I have seen that you have defeated my enemies.
55
A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be accompanied by stringed
instruments
1 God, listen to my prayer,
and do not turn away from me while I am pleading with you.
2 Listen to me, and answer me,
because I am overwhelmed by all my troubles.
3 My enemies cause me to be terrified;
wicked people oppress me.
They cause me to have great troubles;
PSALMS 55:4
830
PSALMS 55:20
they are angry with me, and they hate me.
4 I am terrified,
and I am very much afraid that I will die.
5 I am very fearful and I tremble/shake,
and I am completely terrified.
6 I said, “I wish that I had wings like a dove!
If I had wings, I would fly away and find a place to rest.
7 I would fly far away
and live in the desert.
8 I would quickly find a shelter from my enemies
(Think about that!)
who are like [MET] a strong wind and rainstorm.”
9 Lord, confuse my enemies, and cause their plans to fail,
because I see them acting violently and causing strife in the city of Jerusalem.
10 During each day and night they march around on top of its walls,
committing crimes and causing trouble.
11 They destroy things everywhere.
They oppress and defraud people in the ◄marketplaces/public squares►.
12 If it were an enemy who was making fun of me,
I could endure it.
If it were someone who hates me, who despises me,
I could hide from him.
13 But it is someone who is just like me, my companion,
someone who was my friend who is doing this to me.
14 We previously had many good talks together;
we walked around together in God’s temple.
15 I desire/hope that my enemies will die suddenly;
while they are still young, cause them to go down to the place where the dead
people are.
They they think evil things.
16 But I will ask Yahweh, my God, to help me,
and he will save me.
17 Each morning and each noontime and each evening I tell him what I am concerned
about, and I moan,
and he hears my voice.
18 I have very many enemies,
but he will rescue me and bring me back safely from the battles that I fight.
19 God is the one who has ruled everything forever,
and he will listen to me.
He will cause my enemies to be defeated and disgraced,
because they do not change their evil behavior
and they do not revere God.
(Think about that!)
20 My companion, whom I mentioned previously, betrayed his friends
and broke the agreement that he made with them.
PSALMS 55:21
831
PSALMS 56:13
21 What he said was easy to listen to, like butter is easy to swallow [MET],
but in his inner being he hated people;
his words were soothing like olive oil,
but they hurt people like sharp swords do [MET].
he will never allow righteous people to experience disasters.
as long as they expect to live;
but as for me, I will trust in you.
56
A psalm written by David for the choir director, concerning the time the Philistines
seized David in Gath; to be sung using the tune ‘Dove on distant oaks’
1 God, be merciful to me because men have harassed me;
all day my enemies pursue me.
2 My enemies harass me all day long;
there are many of them who proudly attack me.
3 But whenever I am afraid,
I trust in you.
4 God, I praise/thank you because you do what you have promised;
I trust in you, and then I am not afraid.
Ordinary humans certainly cannot [RHQ] harm me!
5 All day long my enemies claim that I said things that I did not say (OR, try to destroy
what I am doing);
they are always thinking of ways to harm me.
6 In order to cause trouble for me, they hide
and watch everything that I do,
waiting for an opportunity to kill me [MTY].
7 So, God, punish them for the wicked things that they are doing;
show that you are angry by defeating those people!
8 You have counted all the times that I have been wandering alone/distressed;
it is as though you have put all my tears in a bottle
in order that you can see how much I have cried.
You have counted my tears and written the number in your book.
9 When I call out to you, my God, my enemies will be defeated;
I know that will happen, because you are fighting for me.
10 I praise/thank you that you do what you have promised;
Yahweh, I will always praise you for that [DOU].
11 I trust in you, and as a result, I will not be afraid.
I know that humans cannot really [RHQ] harm me!
12 I will bring to you the offering that I promised;
I will bring an offering to you to thank you,
PSALMS 57:1
832
PSALMS 57:11
you have kept me from stumbling.
As a result, I will continue to live in your presence in the light that shines on those
who are still alive (OR, in the light that enables people to live).
57
A psalm written by David for the choir director, when David went into a cave to
escape from Saul; to be sung using the tune ‘Do not destroy’
1 God, be merciful to me!
Act mercifully toward me because I come to you to protect me.
I ask you to protect me like little birds are protected under their mother’s wings [MET]
until the storm/danger is ended.
2 God, you who are greater than all other gods,
I cry out to you, the one who enables me to do all that you desire.
3 You will answer me from heaven and rescue me,
but you will cause those who oppress me to be defeated and disgraced!
(Think about that!)
God will always faithfully love me and ◄will be faithful/ will do what he
promises►.
4 Sometimes I am surrounded by my enemies who are like lions that kill humans;
they are like lions that chew with their teeth animals that they kill;
but my enemies have spears and arrows, not teeth;
and the false things that they say [MTY] hurt people as much as sharp swords hurt
people [MET].
5 God, show in the heavens that you are very great!
And show your glory to people all over the earth!
6 It is as if [MET, HYP] my enemies spread a net to seize me,
and I became very distressed [IDM].
It is as if [MET, HYP] they dug a deep pit along the path where I walk,
but they themselves fell into it!
(Think about that!)
7 God, I have complete confidence [DOU] in you.
and I will praise you while I sing.
I will arise before the sun rises
9 Lord, I will thank you among all the people;
and I will sing to praise you among many ethnic groups,
10 because your faithful love for us is as great as the distance from the earth to
the sky,
and because your ◄faithfulness/faithfully doing what you promise► is as great
as the distance up to the clouds [MET].
11 God, show in the heavens that you are very great!
And show your glory to people all over the earth!
PSALMS 58:1
833
PSALMS 59:5
58
A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be sung using the tune ‘Do not
destroy’
1 When you mighty men speak, you never say what is right;
you never decide things about people justly [RHQ]!
2 No, in your inner beings you think only about doing what is wrong,
and you commit violent crimes in this land of Israel.
3 Wicked people do wrong things and tell lies from the time that they are born [DOU].
4 God, show in the heavens how great you are!
And show your glory to people all over the earth!
What wicked people say injures people like the venom of a snake [MET];
They refuse to listen to good advice, as though they were cobras that were deaf
[MET]!
5 As a result, like a snake that does not respond when a charmer plays a flute or when
someone sings magic songs,
they do not pay attention when others rebuke them.
6 God, as for these enemies who want to attack me like young lions,
break their teeth!
7 Cause them to disappear like water disappears in dry ground!
Cause the arrows that they shoot to have no ◄heads/sharp points►!
8 Cause them to become like snails that disappear in the slime;
cause them to be like babies that are born dead!
9 Get rid of them
as fast as thornbushes are blown away after they are cut (OR, as fast as a fire
heats a pot over burning thorns).
10 Righteous people will rejoice when they see wicked people being punished as they
deserve;
they will wash their feet in the blood of wicked people.
11 Then people will say, “It is true that there is a reward for righteous people;
and there is indeed a God who judges people justly here on the earth!”
59
A psalm written by David for the choir director, when Saul, wanting to kill David,
sent men to watch David’s house
1 God, save me from my enemies!
Protect me from those who want to attack me!
2 Rescue me from men who want to do what is wicked,
men who are murderers!
3 Look! They are waiting to kill me!
Fierce men have gathered to assault me.
Yahweh, they are doing that even though I have not done what is wrong!
4 It is not because I have committed any sin against them
that they run and get ready to attack me.
5 Yahweh my God, commander of the armies of heaven, the one we Israelis worship,
arise and punish the ungodly/heathen people of all the nations;
secretly planned to harm► us.
834
PSALMS 60:2
6 They return each evening,
snarling like vicious dogs [SIM] as they prowl around this city.
7 They loudly say terrible things;
they say [MTY] many things that injure people like [MET] swords do,
but they think, “No one will [RHQ] hear us!”
8 But Yahweh, you laugh at them.
You ◄scoff at/ridicule► the people of the pagan nations.
9 God, I have confidence in you because you are very strong;
you are my refuge.
10 Because you love me, you will come to save me;
you will allow me to watch while you defeat my enemies.
11 But do not kill them immediately
in order that my people will not forget how you punished them!
Instead, Lord, you who are like a shield that protects us [MET],
scatter them by your power, and then defeat them.
12 Because what they say [MTY] is sinful,
allow them to be trapped for being proud.
Because they are always cursing and telling lies,
13 because you are angry, get rid of them;
destroy them completely
in order that people will know that you rule over us, your Israeli people,
and that you rule over all the earth.
(Think about that!)
14 My enemies return each evening,
snarling like vicious dogs as they prowl around this city.
15 They roam around, searching for food;
and if they do not find enough, they growl.
16 But as for me, I will sing about your power;
every morning I will sing joyfully about your faithfully loving us.
I will sing about how you protected me when I was very distressed.
you faithfully love me.
60
A psalm written by David for the choir director, a psalm for teaching, to be sung
using the tune ‘Lily of the Promise’. David wrote it during the wars in northern Syria,
and Joab’s army, after returning from the battle, killed 12,000 of the Edom people-group
in Salt Valley
1 I prayed, “God, you have rejected us Israelis!
Because you have been angry with us,
you have enabled our enemies to break through our ranks.
Please enable us to be strong again!
2 When we were defeated, it was as though [MET] there was a big earthquake in our
land that caused the ground to split open.
So now, just as only you can cause the cracks in the land to disappear,
PSALMS 60:3
835
PSALMS 61:4
help our army to be strong again,
because it is as though our country is ◄falling apart/being destroyed►.
3 You have caused us, your people, to suffer very much;
it is as though you forced us to drink strong wine that caused us to stagger around
after we became drunk.
4 But you have raised a battle flag for those who revere you
in order that they can gather around it and not be killed by the enemies’ arrows.
(Think about that!)
5 Answer our prayers and enable us by your power [MTY] to defeat our enemies
in order that we, the people whom you love, will be saved.”
6 Then God answered my prayer and spoke from his temple, saying,
“Because I have conquered your enemies, I will divide up everything in Shechem city,
and I will distribute it among my people the land in Succoth Valley.
7 The Gilead region is mine;
the people of the tribe of Manasseh are mine;
the tribe of Ephraim is like my helmet [MET];
and the tribe of Judah is like the ◄scepter/stick that I hold which shows that I am the
ruler► [MET];
8 but the Moab region is like my washbasin [MET];
I throw my sandal in the Edom area to show that it belongs to me;
I shout triumphantly because I have defeated the people of the Philistia area.”
9 Because I want to defeat the people of Edom,
◄who will lead my army triumphantly to their capital city that has strong walls around
strong walls around it.►” [RHQ]
10 So, God, we desire/hope that [RHQ] you have not truly abandoned us,
and that you will go with us when our armies march out to fight our enemies.
because the help that humans can give us is worthless.
you will enable us to defeat our enemies.
61
A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be accompanied by musical
instruments
1 God, listen to me,
and answer my prayer [DOU]!
2 While I am discouraged and far from my home,
I am calling out to you.
on top of which I will be safe.
you have been like a strong tower [MET]
in which I am safe from being attacked by my enemies.
4 Allow me to live close to your temple all during my life [HYP]!
PSALMS 61:5
836
PSALMS 62:10
Allow me to be safe [MET], like a little bird is safe under its mother’s wings.
(Think about that!)
5 God, you heard me when I solemnly promised to give offerings to you;
you have given to me the blessings that belong to those who have an awesome
respect for you [MTY].
6 I am the king of Israel;
please allow me to live and rule for many years,
and allow my descendants to rule also.
7 Allow us to rule forever while you observe us;
watch over us while you faithfully love us and do for us what you promised.
8 If you do that, I will always sing to praise you [MTY]
while I offer to you each day the sacrifices that I promised to give to you.
62
A psalm written by David for Jeduthun, the choir leader
1 God is the only one who can give me peace in my inner being,
and he is the one who saves me from my enemies.
2 Only he is like an overhanging rock under which I can be safe [MET];
he will be like a shelter, with the result that I will never be defeated [MET].
3 When will you, my enemies, stop attacking me [RHQ]?
I feel that I am as useless against you as a wall that is about to fall over or a
broken-down fence [MET].
4 My enemies plan to remove me from my important position so that people no longer
honor me.
They delight in telling lies.
but in their inner beings they curse those people.
5 God is the only one who gives me peace in my inner being;
he is the one whom I confidently expect to help me.
6 Only he is like an overhanging rock under which I can be safe [MET];
he is like a shelter, and as a result I will never be defeated.
7 God is the one who saves me and honors me.
He is like an overhanging strong rock under which I can find shelter [MET].
8 You my people, always trust in him.
Tell him all your troubles,
because he is ◄our refuge/the one who protects us► [MET].
(Think about that!)
9 People who are considered to be unimportant are as worthless/unreliable as a breath
of air;
people who are considered to be important also really ◄amount to nothing/
cannot be trusted to help us►.
If you put them all on a scale, it would be as if they weighed less than a puff of air.
10 Do not trust in money gained by extorting it from others;
do not try to gain anything by robbing others.
If you become very wealthy, do not trust in [IDM] your money.
PSALMS 62:11
837
PSALMS 64:4
11 I have heard God say more than once that he is the one who really has power,
12 and that he is the one who faithfully loves us.
He rewards every one of us according to the deeds that we do.
63
A psalm written by David when he was in the desert in Judea
1 God, you are the God whom I worship.
I greatly desire to be with you
like [SIL] a person in a dry hot desert greatly desires some cool water.
2 So, I want to see you in your temple;
3 Your constantly loving me is ◄worth more/more precious► than my life,
4 I will praise you all the time that I live;
5 Knowing you satisfies me more than [IDM, MET] my eating a very big feast,
so I will praise you while I sing [MTY] joyful songs.
6 While I lie on my bed, I think about you.
I think/meditate about you all during the night,
7 because you have always helped me,
and I sing joyfully knowing that I am protected by you
as a little bird is protected under its mother’s wings [MET].
8 I cling to you;
and with your hand/power you protect me.
9 But those who are trying to kill me
will die and descend into the place of the dead;
10 they will be killed in battles [MTY]
and their corpses will be eaten by jackals/wild dogs.
11 But I, the king of Israel, will rejoice in what God has done;
and all those who revere and trust God will praise him,
but he will not allow liars to say anything.
64
A psalm written by David for the choir director
1 God, listen to me as I tell you the things that I am worried about.
I am afraid of my enemies; so save/rescue me from them.
2 Protect me from what wicked men are planning to do to me;
protect me from that gang of men who do what is evil.
3 The hostile things they say [MTY] are like [SIM] sharp swords;
their cruel words are like [SIM] arrows.
4 Without being afraid, they lie about people and slander people who have not done
what is wrong,
like someone who suddenly jumps up from where he is hiding and shoots arrows
at his enemy [MET].
PSALMS 64:5
838
they talk with each other about where they can set traps to catch people,
and they think, “No one [RHQ] will see what we are doing,
6 because we have planned very well the crime that we are going to commit!”
No one can fully understand what people can think and plan!
7 But it will be as though God will shoot his arrows at them,
and suddenly they will be wounded.
8 Because of what they say [MTY], he will get rid of them,
and then everyone who sees what has happened to them will shake their heads
to ridicule them.
9 And then everyone will be afraid to sin because of what might happen to them, also;
they will tell others what God has done,
and they themselves will think much about it.
10 Righteous people should rejoice because of what Yahweh has done;
they should go to him to ◄find protection/be safe►;
and all those who are godly will praise him.
65
A psalm written by David for the choir director
1 God, it is right/appropriate for us to praise you in Jerusalem,
and to do what we have promised you that we would do,
2 because you answer our prayers.
People everywhere will come to you
3 because of the sins that they have committed.
Our many sins are like a very heavy burden to us,
but you forgive us.
4 You are pleased with those whom you have chosen
to live close to your temple.
We are happy with all the blessings that we receive from worshiping in your sacred
temple.
5 God, when we pray to you, you answer us and save us by doing awesome deeds;
you are the one who rescues us;
people who live in very remote places on the earth, on the other side of the oceans,
trust in you.
6 By your strength you put the mountains in their places,
showing that you are very powerful.
7 You calm the seas when they roar,
and you stop the waves from crashing on the shore;
you also calm people when they ◄make a great uproar/shout angrily together►.
8 People who live in very remote/distant places on the earth
◄are awed by/revere► you because of the miracles that you perform;
because of what you do,
people who live far to the west and far to the east shout joyfully.
you fill the streams with water,
PSALMS 65:10
839
PSALMS 66:12
and cause grain/crops to grow.
10 You send plenty of rain on the fields that have been plowed,
With showers you soften the hard clods/lumps of soil,
11 Because you bless the soil, there are very good crops at harvest season;
wherever you have gone [MTY], good crops are very abundant [IDM].
12 The pastures are full of flocks of sheep and goats;
it is as though the hills are very joyful.
13 The meadows are full of sheep and goats,
and the valleys are full of grain;
it is as though they also sing and shout joyfully.
66
A psalm which is a song for the choir director
1 Tell everyone on the earth
that they should sing joyfully to praise God!
2 They should sing songs that say that God [MTY] is very great,
and they should tell everyone that he is very glorious!
3 They should say to God, “The things that you do are awesome!
You are very powerful,
with the result that your enemies ◄cringe/bow down► in front of you.”
4 Everyone on the earth should worship God
and sing to praise him
and honor him [MTY].
(Think about that!)
5 Come and think about what God has done!
Think about the awesome things that he has done.
6 He caused the Red Sea to become dry land,
with the result that our ancestors were able to walk right through it.
There we rejoiced because of what he had done.
7 By his great power he rules forever,
and he keeps watching all the nations to see what things they do,
so those nations that want to rebel against him should not be proud.
(Think about that!)
8 You people of all nations, praise our God!
and he has not allowed us to ◄stumble/be defeated►.
10 God, you have tested us;
you have allowed us to experience great difficulties to make our lives become pure
as people put precious metals in a hot fire to burn out what is impure [MET].
11 It is as if you allowed us to fall into traps [MET],
and you forced us to endure difficult things which were like putting heavy loads
on our backs [MET].
12 You allowed our enemies to trample on us;
PSALMS 66:13
840
PSALMS 67:7
we experienced difficulties/troubles that were like [MET] walking through fires and
floods,
but now you have brought us into a place where we have plenty.
13 Yahweh, I will bring to your temple offerings that are to be completely burned on
the altar;
I will offer to you what I promised.
14 When I was experiencing much trouble, I said that I would bring offerings to you
if you rescued me;
and you did rescue me, so I will bring to you what I promised.
15 I will bring sheep to be burned on the altar,
and I will also sacrifice bulls and goats,
and when they are burning, you will be pleased when the smoke rises up ◄to you/
to the sky►.
(Think about that!)
16 All you people who revere God, come and listen,
and I will tell you what he has done for me.
17 I called out to him to help me,
and I praised him while I was speaking to him [MTY].
18 If I had ignored the sins that I had committed,
the Lord would not have paid any attention to me.
19 But because I confessed my sins, God has listened to me
and he paid attention to my prayers.
20 I praise God
because he has not ignored my prayers
A psalm for the choir director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments
1 God, be merciful to us and bless us;
be kind to us [IDM],
(Think about that!)
2 in order that everyone in the world may know what you want them to do,
and the people of all nations may know that you have the power to save them.
3 God, I desire that all people-groups will praise you;
I want them all to praise you!
4 I desire that the people of all nations will be glad and sing joyfully,
because you judge the people-groups equally/justly,
and you guide all nations in the world.
(Think about that!)
5 God, I desire that the people-groups will praise you;
I want them all to praise you!
6 Good crops have grown on our land;
God, our God, has blessed us.
7 And because God has blessed us,
I desire that all people everywhere [MTY] on the earth will revere him.

A psalm written by David for the choir director
1 God, arise and scatter your enemies,
and cause those who hate you to run away from you.
2 Like wind blows smoke away,
chase your enemies away.
Like wax melts when it is near a fire,
cause wicked people to ◄disappear/be destroyed►.
3 But righteous people should be joyful;
they should rejoice when they are in God’s presence;
they should be happy, and be very joyful.
4 Sing to God; sing to praise him;
sing a song (OR, make a road) for him who rides on the clouds;
his name is Yahweh; be glad when you are in his presence.
5 God, who lives in his sacred temple, is like [MET] a father to those who are orphans,
6 For those who have no one to live with, he provides families to live with.
but those who rebel against him will be forced to live in a very hot and dry land.
7 God, you led your people out of Egypt,
and then you marched with them through the desert.
(Think about that!)
because when you, the God worshiped by us Israeli people,
appeared to us at Sinai Mountain,,
the earth shook,
and rain poured down from the sky.
9 You caused plenty of rain to fall on your land,
and so you enabled good crops to grow again on the land that you gave to us
Israelis.
10 Your people built homes there;
and because you were good to them, you provided food for those who were poor.
8 After you did that,
11 The Lord gave a message,
and many women took that message to other places.
12 They proclaimed, “Many kings and their armies are running away from our army!”
When our army brought back to their homes the things that they captured,
the women who were at home divided up those things among themselves and among
their families.
13 Even those women who were in the pens taking care of the sheep received some of
those things;
they got statues of doves whose wings were covered with silver
and whose feathers were covered with pure yellow gold.
14 When Almighty God scattered the enemy kings and their armies,
the number of weapons that they abandoned there seemed like there had been a
snowstorm on Zalmon (OR, a black) Mountain.
15 There is a very high mountain in the Bashan region,
a mountain which has many peaks.
PSALMS 68:16
842
PSALMS 68:31
16 But the people who live near that mountain should not [RHQ] envy those who live
near Zion,
the mountain on which God chose to live!
Yahweh will live there forever!
17 After we defeated all our enemies,
it was as though the Lord, surrounded by many thousands of strong chariots,
descended from Sinai Mountain
18 He ascended the sacred mountain where his temple is,
and received gifts from the enemies whom he had defeated.
and Yahweh our God will live there in his sacred temple forever.
19 Praise the Lord, who helps us carry our heavy loads every day;
he is the one who saves/rescues us.
20 Our God is the God who saves us;
(Think about that!)
He is Yahweh, our Lord, the one who ◄allows us to escape/prevents us► from
being killed in battles.
21 But God will smash the heads of his enemies,
the skulls of those who continue to behave sinfully.
22 The Lord said, “I will bring back the corpses of those who were killed in Bashan,
and I will bring back those who sank deep in the ocean and drowned.
23 I will do that in order that you may wash your feet in their blood,
and your dogs can also lap up some of your enemies’ blood.”
24 God, many people see you march triumphantly into your sacred temple,
celebrating that you have defeated your enemies.
You march like a king does, and a large crowd walks with you.
25 The singers are in front, and the people who play stringed instruments are at the
rear,
and young women who are beating their tambourines are between them.
26 They are all singing, “You Israeli people, praise God when you gather together;
27 First come the people of the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest tribe,
and following them come the leaders of the tribe of Judah and their group,
and following them come the leaders of the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali.
28 God, show people that you are very powerful;
show people the power with which you have helped us previously.
29 Show that power from your temple in Jerusalem,
where kings bring gifts to you.
30 Rebuke your enemies, such as those in Egypt who are like wild hippopotamuses/
animals that live in the reeds;
and powerful nations that are like bulls that are among their calves [MET];
rebuke/trample them until they bow down and give you gifts of silver.
Scatter the people who enjoy making wars.
31 Then people will bring gifts of bronze (OR, of cloth) to you from Egypt;
the people in Ethiopia will lift up their hands to praise you.
PSALMS 68:32
843
33 Sing to the God, the one who rides across the sky,
(Think about that!)
the sky that he created long ago.
Listen as he shouts with a very powerful voice.
34 Proclaim that God is very powerful;
he is the king that rules over Israel,
and in the skies he also shows that he is powerful.
35 God is awesome as he comes out of his sacred temple;
he is the God whom we Israeli people worship.
He makes [DOU] his people very powerful.
Praise God!
69
A psalm written by David for the choir director
1 O God, save me,
because I am in great danger.
It is as though flood water is up to my neck, and I am about to drown [MET].
2 I continue to sink in the deep mud,
and there is no solid ground for me to stand on.
I am in deep water,
and flood waters are swirling around me.
3 I am exhausted from calling out for help;
my throat is very dry.
Because I have cried so much as I have waited for God to help me,
my eyes are swollen.
4 Those who hate me when there is no reason to hate me
are more than the number of hairs on my head [HYP]!
Those who want to get rid of me are strong,
and they tell lies about me.
They demand that I return to them things that I did not steal!
5 O God, ◄you see the sins that I have committed/my sins are not hidden from you►.
You know that I have foolishly disobeyed your laws.
6 O Yahweh God, you who are the commander of the armies of heaven,
do not allow the wrong things that I have done
to cause those who trust in you to be disappointed/disillusioned.
O God, you whom we Israeli people worship,
do not allow me to cause your people to be humiliated.
7 People have insulted/ridiculed me because I am devoted to you.
They have thoroughly humiliated [IDM] me.
8 Even my own older brothers act as if they do not know me;
they treat me like a foreigner.
9 Some people have despised your temple;
but my zeal for keeping your temple holy is like a fire burning inside me.
10 When I have humbled myself and ◄fasted/abstained from eating food►
844
PSALMS 69:28
they just insult me.
11 When I put on rough sackcloth to show that I am sad,
they laugh at [IDM] me.
12 Even the elders of the city say bad things about me.
The drunkards of the city sing disgusting songs about me.
13 But Yahweh, I will continue praying to you.
At the time that you choose, answer me and rescue me
because you faithfully love me.
14 Do not allow me to sink any more in the mud.
Rescue me from those who hate me!
Lift me up out of these deep waters!
15 Do not allow flood waters to swirl around me,
do not allow the deep mud to swallow me;
keep me from sinking into the pit of death [MET].
16 O Yahweh, answer my prayer and help me
because you are good and love me faithfully.
17 Do not ◄hide yourself from/refuse to hear► me;
answer me quickly
because I am in great trouble.
18 Come near to me and save me;
rescue me from my enemies.
19 You know that I am insulted
and that people cause me to feel ashamed and dishonored;
you know who all my enemies are.
20 Their insults have deeply offended me,
and I ◄feel helpless/am in despair►.
I searched for someone who would pity me,
but there was no one.
but there were none.
21 Instead, they gave me food that tasted like poison,
and when I was thirsty, they gave me sour wine to drink.
22 I hope/desire that the feasts [MTY] that they enjoy will ◄become a snare for/bring
trouble to► them,
and that those whom they invite to the sacrificial feasts will also be trapped.
23 I hope/desire that their eyesight will become dim so that they cannot see anything,
24 Show them that you are very angry with them!
25 Cause their towns to become abandoned/deserted
26 Do this because they persecute those whom you have punished,
◄they talk about the sins of/they want to hurt even more► those whom you have
wounded.
27 Keep making a record of all their sins,
do not acquit/pardon them for the evil things that they have done.
28 Erase their names [SYN] from the book containing the names of those who have
eternal life;
do not include them in the list of righteous people.
PSALMS 69:29
845
PSALMS 71:4
29 As for me, I have pain and am suffering.
O God, protect me and rescue me.
30 When God does that, I will sing as I praise God,
and I will honor him by thanking him.
31 My doing that will please Yahweh more than sacrificing oxen,
more than offering him full-grown bulls.
32 Oppressed/Afflicted people will see that God has rescued me,
and they will be glad.
I want all of you who ask God to help you to be encouraged.
33 Yahweh listens to those who are needy;
He does not ignore/forget those who are oppressed/imprisoned.
34 I desire that everything will praise God—
everything that is in heaven and on earth, and all the creatures that are in the
seas.
35 God will rescue the people of Jerusalem from their enemies,
and he will rebuild the towns that are in Judah.
His people will live there and again possess the land.
36 The descendants of his people will inherit it,
and those who love him will live there safely.
70
A psalm written by David for the choir director, asking God to help David
1 God, please save me!
Yahweh, come quickly to help me!
2 Humble those who are happy about my troubles/difficulties, and cause them to be
disgraced/ashamed.
3 I hope/desire that you will cause them to become dismayed and ashamed
4 But I hope/desire that all those who go to worship you will be very joyful [DOU].
I want those who love you because you saved them to shout repeatedly [HYP],
“God is great!”
5 As for me, I am poor and needy [DOU];
so God, come quickly to help me!
Yahweh, you are the one who saves and helps me,
so please come quickly!
71
1 Yahweh, I have come to you to ◄get refuge/be protected►;
never allow me to become ashamed because of being defeated.
2 Because you always do what is right, help me and rescue me;
listen to me, and save me!
3 Be like an overhanging rock [MET] under which I can be safe/protected;
be like a strong fortress in which I am safe [DOU].
You continually command (OR, Continually command) your angels to rescue me.
from the power of unjust and evil men.
PSALMS 71:5
846
PSALMS 71:22
5 Yahweh, my Lord, you are the one whom I confidently expect to help me;
I have trusted in you since I was young.
6 I have depended on you all my life;
you have taken care of me [IDM] since the day that I was born,
so I will always praise you.
7 The manner in which I have conducted my life has been an example to many people,
because they realize that you have been my strong defender.
8 I praise you all day long,
and I proclaim that you are glorious/wonderful.
9 Now, when I have become an old man, do not reject/abandon me;
do not abandon me now, when I am not strong any more.
10 My enemies say that they want to kill me;
they plan together how they can do that.
11 They say about me, “God has abandoned him;
so now we can pursue him and seize him,
because there is no one who will rescue him.”
12 God, do not stay far away from me;
hurry to help me!
13 Cause those who ◄accuse me/say that I have done things that are wrong► to be
defeated and destroyed;
cause those who want to harm me to be shamed and disgraced.
14 But as for me, I will continually and confidently expect you to do great things for
me,
and I will praise you more and more.
15 I will tell people that you do what is right;
all day long I will tell people how you have saved me,
although what you have done is more than I can fully understand.
16 Yahweh, my Lord, I will praise you for your mighty deeds;
I will proclaim that only you always act justly.
17 God, you have taught me many/those things ever since I was young,
and I still tell people about your wonderful deeds.
18 And now, God, when I am old and my hair is gray,
do not abandon me.
Stay with me while I continue to proclaim to my children and grandchildren [HYP]
that you are very powerful!
it is as though they extend up to the sky.
You have done great things;
there is no one like you [RHQ].
20 You have caused me to have many troubles and to suffer much,
but you will cause me to become strong again;
when I am almost dead [HYP], you will keep me alive.
21 You will cause me to be greatly honored
and you will encourage/comfort me again.
22 I will also praise you while I play my harp;
I will praise you, my God, for faithfully doing what you have promised to do.
I will play hymns to praise you, the holy God whom we Israelis worship.
PSALMS 71:23
847
PSALMS 72:15
23 I [SYN] will shout joyfully while I play the harp for you;
with my entire inner being I will sing
because you have rescued me.
24 All day long I will tell people that you act righteously,
because those who wanted to harm me will have been defeated and disgraced.
A psalm written by Solomon.
72
A prayer for God to bless the king
1 O God, enable me, the king whom you appointed in Israel, to rule justly.
Show/Teach me how to judge matters fairly
2 in order that I will judge your people fairly,
that I will govern your oppressed people justly.
3 I desire that all over the country—even on the hills and mountains [DOU]—
people will live peacefully and righteously.
4 Help me, your king, to defend the poor people
and to rescue needy people and to defeat those who oppress them.
5 I desire that your people will revere you as long as the moon shines, forever.
6 I desire that my rule will be enjoyed by the people [SIM]
like they enjoy rain on growing crops,
like they enjoy showers that fall on the land.
7 I hope/desire that people will live righteously during the years that I rule,
and that my people will live peacefully and prosperously as long as the moon
shines.
8 I hope/desire that the kings of Israel will rule the people
in all the area from one sea in the east to another in the west,
and from the Euphrates River to the most remote/distant places on earth.
9 I hope/desire that those who live in the desert will bow down before them,
and that their enemies will throw themselves on the ground in submission to
them.
10 I hope/desire that the kings of Spain and of the islands in the Mediterranean Sea
will bring ◄tribute money/taxes► to the kings of Israel,
and that the kings of Sheba to the south and of Seba to the southwest will bring
them gifts.
11 I hope/desire that all the other kings in the world will bow before the kings of Israel,
and that people of all nations will serve them.
12 They will rescue poor people when they ◄cry out/plead► for help,
and help those who are needy and those who have no one to help them.
13 They will pity those who are weak and needy;
he saves the people’s lives.
14 Our kings will rescue the people from being oppressed and from being treated
cruelly,
because ◄their lives/they► [MTY] are precious to our kings.
15 I hope/desire that our kings will live a long time!
I hope/desire that they will be given gold from Sheba.
I desire that people will always pray for our kings
PSALMS 72:16
848
PSALMS 73:11
and praise them all the time, every day.
16 I hope/desire that the fields will produce plenty of grain everywhere, even on the
tops of the hills in the land where they rule,
like the grain that grows on the hills in Lebanon.
I hope/desire that the cities in Israel will be full of people
like the fields are full of grass.
17 I desire that the names of our kings will never be forgotten.
I hope/desire that people will remember them as long as the sun shines.
I hope/desire that people of all nations will ask ◄God to bless them/that they will be
just like he has blessed the kings of Israel.
18 Praise Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship;
he is the only one who does wonderful things.
19 Praise him forever!
I desire that ◄his glory will fill the whole world/people all over the world may
see that he is very great► [MTY]!
Amen! May it be so!
20 That is the end of this group of prayers/songs written by David, the son of Jesse.
Book Three
73
A psalm written by Asaph
1 God truly is good to us Israeli people,
to those who totally want to do all that God desires.
2 As for me, I almost stopped trusting in God;
it was as though my feet slipped and I stumbled [MET],
3 because I envied those who proudly said that they did not need God,
and I saw that they prospered even though they were wicked.
4 Those people do not have any pains;
they are always strong and healthy.
5 They do not have the troubles/difficulties that other people have;
they do not have problems like others do.
6 So they are proud, and their being proud is like a necklace that they show to others,
and they show off their violent actions like people show off their beautiful robes.
7 From their inner beings they ◄pour out/do► evil deeds,
and they are always thinking about more evil things to do.
8 They scoff at other people, and they talk about doing evil things to them;
they are proud while they plan to oppress others.
9 They say evil things about God who is in heaven [MTY],
and they talk boastfully/proudly about things that they have done here on the
earth.
10 The result is that people listen to what they say and praise them
and do not think that they have done anything that is wrong.
11 Wicked people say to themselves, “God will certainly not [RHQ] know what we have
done;
people say that he is greater than any other god, but he does not know everything.”
PSALMS 73:12
849
PSALMS 74:1
12 That is what wicked people are like;
they never worry about anything, and they are always becoming richer.
13 So, God, I think it is useless that I have [RHQ] always done what you want me to,
and that I have not sinned.
14 All day long I have problems,
and every morning you punish me.
15 If I had said the things that the wicked people say,
I would have been sinning against your people.
16 And when I tried to think about all this,
it was very difficult for me to understand it.
17 But when I went to your temple, you spoke to me,
and I understood what will happen to the wicked people after they die.
18 Now I know that you will surely put them in slippery places,
and they will fall down and die.
19 They will be destroyed instantly;
they will die in terrible ways.
20 They will disappear as quickly as a dream disappears when a person awakes in the
morning;
Lord, when you arise, you will ◄cause them to disappear/forget all about them►.
21 When I felt sad/bitter,
and brokenhearted,
22 I was stupid and ignorant,
and I behaved like an animal toward you.
23 But I am always close to you,
and you hold my hand.
24 You guide me by teaching me,
and ◄at the end of my life/when I die►, you will receive me and honor me.
25 You are in heaven and I belong to you [RHQ],
and there is nothing on this earth that I desire more than that.
26 My body and my mind may become very weak,
but God, you continue to enable me to be strong;
I belong to you forever.
28 But as for me, it is wonderful to be near to God
and to proclaim to others all that he has done for me.
74
A psalm written by Asaph
1 God, why have you abandoned/rejected us?
Will you keep rejecting us forever [RHQ]?
Why are you angry with us,
PSALMS 74:2
850
PSALMS 74:21
since we are like sheep in your pasture and you are like our shepherd? [MET,
RHQ]
2 Do not forget your people whom you chose long ago,
the people whom you freed from being slaves in Egypt and caused to become your
tribe.
Do not forget Jerusalem, which was ◄your home/where you dwelt► on this earth.
3 Walk along and see where everything has been totally ruined;
our enemies have destroyed everything in the sacred temple.
4 Your enemies shouted triumphantly in this sacred place;
they erected their banners to show they had defeated us.
5 They cut down all the engraved objects in the temple like woodsmen cut down trees.
6 Then they smashed all the carved wood with their axes and hammers.
7 Then they burned your temple to the ground;
they caused that place where you were worshiped to be unfit for people to
worship in.
8 They said to themselves, “We will destroy the Israelis completely,”
and they also burned down all the other places where we gathered to worship
God.
9 All our sacred symbols (OR, miracles) are gone;
there are no prophets now/any more,
and no one knows how long this situation will continue.
10 God, how long will our enemies make fun of you [RHQ]?
Will they insult you [MTY] forever [RHQ]?
11 Why do you refuse to help [MTY, RHQ] us?
Why do you keep your hand inside your cloak instead of using it to destroy our
enemies [RHQ]?
12 God, you have been our king all the time since we came out of Egypt [HYP],
and you have enabled us to defeat our enemies in the land of Israel.
13 By your power you caused the Red Sea to divide;
it was as though you smashed the heads of the rulers of Egypt who were like huge
14 It was as though you crushed the head of the king of Egypt [MET]
15 You caused springs and streams to flow,
and you also dried up rivers that had never dried up previously.
16 You created the days and the nights,
and you put the sun and the moon in their places.
17 You determined where the oceans end and the land begins,
and you created the summer/hot season and the winter/cold season.
18 Yahweh, do not forget that your enemies laugh at you,
and that it is foolish people who despise you [MTY].
19 Do not let your helpless people [MET] fall into the hands of their cruel enemies;
do not forget your suffering/persecuted people.
20 Do not forget the agreement that you made with us;
remember that there are violent people in every dark place on the earth.
21 Do not allow your oppressed people to be disgraced;
PSALMS 74:22
851
PSALMS 76:2
help those poor and needy people in order that they will again praise you [MTY].
22 God, arise and defend yourself by defending your people!
Do not forget that foolish people laugh at you ◄all day long/continually►!
23 Do not forget that your enemies shout angrily at you;
the uproar that they make while they oppose you never stops.
75
A psalm written by Asaph for the choir director, to be sung using the tune ‘Do not
destroy’
1 We give thanks to you;
our God, we thank you.
You are close to us,
and we proclaim to others the wonderful things that you have done for us.
2 You have said, “I have appointed a time when I will judge people,
and I will judge everyone fairly.
3 When the earth shakes
and all the creatures on the earth tremble,
I am the one who will ◄keep its foundations steady/prevent it from being destroyed►.
(Think about that!)
4 I say to people who ◄boast/talk proudly about themselves►, ‘Stop bragging!’
and I say to wicked people, ‘Do not proudly do things to show how great you are
[IDM]!
5 Do not be arrogant,
and do not speak so boastfully!’ ”
6 The one who judges people does not come from the east or from the west,
and he does not come from the desert.
he says that some have sinned and must be punished, and that others have not
done what is wrong.
8 It is as though Yahweh holds a cup in his hand;
it is filled with wine that has spices mixed in it to cause those who drink it to
become more drunk;
and when Yahweh pours it out, he will force all the wicked people to drink it;
they will drink every drop of it,
which means that he will give them all the punishment that they deserve.
9 But as for me, I will never stop saying what the God whom Jacob worshiped has
done;
I will never quit singing to praise him.
10 He will destroy the power [IDM] of wicked people,
but he will cause righteous people to become more powerful.
76
A psalm written by Asaph for the choir director, to be accompanied by stringed
instruments
1 People in Judah know God;
the Israeli people honor him [MTY].
2 His home is in Jerusalem;
PSALMS 76:3
852
PSALMS 77:7
he lives on Zion Hill.
3 There he broke the flaming arrows that his enemies shot,
and he also broke their shields and swords and other weapons that they used in
battles.
(Think about that!)
4 God, you are glorious!
You are like a king as you return from the mountains where you defeated your enemies.
5 Their brave soldiers were killed, and then those who killed them took away everything
that those soldiers had.
Those enemies died [EUP],
so they were unable to use their weapons any more!
6 When you, the God whom Jacob worshiped, rebuked your enemies,
the result was that their horses and their riders fell down dead.
7 But you cause everyone to be afraid.
When you are angry and you punish people, no one can [RHQ] endure it.
8 From heaven you proclaimed that you would judge people,
and then everyone on the earth was afraid and did not say anything more,
9 when you arose to declare that you would punish wicked people
(Think about that!)
days.
11 So give to Yahweh the offerings that you promised to give to him;
all the people of nearby people-groups should also bring gifts to him, the one who
is awesome.
12 He humbles [IDM] princes,
and even causes great kings to be terrified.
77
A psalm written by Asaph for Jeduthun, the choir director
2 Whenever have trouble, I pray to the Lord;
all during the night I lift up my hands while I pray,
but nothing causes me to be comforted.
3 When I think about God, I ◄despair/think that he will never help me►;
when I meditate about him, I am discouraged.
4 All during the night he prevents me from sleeping;
(Think about that!)
I am very worried, with the result that I do not know what to say.
5 I think about days that have passed;
I remember what happened in previous years.
6 I spend the whole night thinking about things;
I meditate, and this is what I ask myself:
7 “Will the Lord always reject us?
Will he never again be pleased with us?
PSALMS 77:8
853
PSALMS 78:5
8 Has he stopped faithfully loving us?
Will he not do for us what he promised to do?
9 God promised to be merciful to us; has he forgotten that?
Because he is angry with us, has he decided to not be kind to us?”
10 Then I said, “What causes me to be very sad is that
11 But then, Yahweh, I recall/remember your great deeds;
I remember the wonderful things that you did in the past.
and I think about your mighty acts.
13 God, everything that you do is holy;
there is certainly no god [RHQ] who is great like you are!
14 You are God, the one who performs miracles;
you showed to people of many people-groups that you are powerful.
15 By your power [MTY] you rescued your people from Egypt;
you saved those who were descendants of Jacob and his son Joseph.
(Think about that!)
16 It was as though the waters of the Red Sea saw you and became very afraid,
and even the deepest part of the water shook.
17 Rain poured down from the clouds [PRS];
it thundered very loudly [PRS],
and lightning flashed in all directions.
18 Thunder crashed in the whirlwind,
and lightning ◄lit up/flashed across► the entire sky [HYP];
the earth shook violently [DOU].
19 Then you walked through the sea
on a path that you made through the deep water,
but your footprints could not be seen.
20 You led your people like a shepherd leads his flock of sheep,
while Moses and Aaron were the leaders of your people.
A psalm written by Asaph

1 My friends, listen to what I am going to teach you;
pay careful attention [IDM] to what I say.
2 I am going to give you some sayings that wise people have said.
They will be sayings about things that happened long ago,
things that were difficult to understand [MET],
3 things that we have heard and known previously,
things that our parents and grandparents told us.
4 We will tell these things to our children [LIT],
and we will also tell to our grandchildren
about Yahweh’s power and the glorious/great things that he has done.
5 He gave laws and commandments to the Israeli people,
those who are the descendants of Jacob [DOU],
PSALMS 78:6
854
PSALMS 78:25
and he told our ancestors to teach them to their children
6 in order that their children would also know them
and then they would teach them to their children.
7 In that way, they also would trust in God,
and not forget the things that he has done;
instead, they would obey his commandments.
8 They would not be like their ancestors,
who were very stubborn and kept rebelling against God;
they did not continue firmly trusting in God,
and they did not worship only him.
9 The soldiers of the tribe of Ephraim had bows and arrows
enemies.
they refused to obey his laws.
11 They forgot what he had done;
they forgot about the miracles that they had seen him perform.
12 While our ancestors were watching,
God performed miracles in the area around Zoan city in Egypt.
13 Then he caused the Red Sea to divide,
causing the water on each side to pile up like a wall,
with the result that our ancestors walked through it on dry ground.
14 He led them by a bright cloud during the day
and by a fiery light during the night.
15 He split rocks open in the desert,
giving to our ancestors plenty of water from deep inside the earth.
16 He caused a stream of water to flow from the rock;
the water flowed like a river [DOU].
17 But our ancestors continued to sin against God;
in the desert they rebelled against the one who is greater than any other god.
18 By demanding that God give them the food that they desired,
they tried to find out if he would always do what they requested him to do.
19 They insulted God by saying, “We don’t think he can supply food for us here in this
desert!
20 It is true that he struck the rock,
with the result that water gushed/flowed out,
but ◄can he also provide bread and meat for us, his people?/we doubt that he can
also provide bread and meat for us, his people.►” [RHQ]
21 So, when Yahweh heard that, he became very angry,
and he sent a fire to burn up some of his Israeli people. [MTY, DOU]
22 He did that because they did not trust in him,
and they did not believe that he would rescue them.
23 But God spoke to the sky above them;
he commanded it to open like a door,
24 and then food fell down like rain,
food which they named ‘manna’;
God gave them grain from ◄heaven/the sky►.
25 So the people ate the food that angels eat,
and God gave to them all the manna that they wanted.
PSALMS 78:26
855
PSALMS 78:44
26 Later, he caused the wind to blow from the east,
and by his power he also sent wind from the south,
27 and the wind brought birds
which were as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore.
28 God caused those birds to fall dead in the middle of ◄their camp►/the area where
the people had put up their tents.
There were dead birds all around their tents.
29 So the people cooked the birds and ate the meat and their stomachs were full,
30 But before they had eaten all that they wanted,
31 God was still very angry with them,
he got rid of many of the finest young Israeli men.
32 In spite of all that, the people continued to sin;
in spite of all the miracles that God had performed,
they still did not trust that he would take care of them.
33 So, he caused their lives to end as quickly as a puff of wind ends;
they died when disasters suddenly struck them.
34 When God caused some of them to die,
the others turned to God;
they repented and earnestly asked God to save them.
35 They remembered that God is like a huge rock ledge under which they would be safe
[MET],
and that he, who was greater than any other god, is the one who protected/rescued
them.
36 But they tried to deceive God by what they said [MTY];
their words [MTY] were all lies.
37 They were not loyal to him;
they disregarded/ignored the agreement that he had made with them.
38 But God was merciful to his people.
He forgave them for having sinned
and did not get rid of them.
Many times he refrained from becoming angry with them
and restrained from furiously/severely punishing them [MTY].
39 He remembered/considered that they were only humans who die;
they disappear quickly [SIM], like a wind that blows by and then is gone.
40 Many times our ancestors rebelled against God in the desert
and caused him to become very sad.
41 Many times they did evil things, to find out if they could do those things without
God punishing them.
They frequently caused the holy God of Israel to become disgusted/sad.
42 They forgot about his great power,
and they ◄forgot/did not think► about the time when he rescued them from their
enemies.
43 They forgot about when he performed many miracles
in the area near Zoan city in Egypt.
44 He caused the Nile River (OR, their sources of water) to become red like blood,
with the result that the people of Egypt had no water to drink.
PSALMS 78:45
856
PSALMS 78:64
45 He sent among the people of Egypt swarms of flies that bit them,
and he sent frogs that ate up everything.
46 He sent locusts to eat their crops
and the other things that grew in their fields.
47 He sent hail that destroyed the grapevines,
48 He sent hail that killed their cattle
49 Because God was fiercely angry with the people of Egypt,
The disasters that struck them were like a group of angels that destroyed
50 He did not lessen his being angry with them,
and he did not ◄spare their lives/prevent them from dying►;
he sent a ◄plague/serious illness► that killed many of them.
51 He also caused all the firstborn sons of the people of Egypt to die.
52 Then he led his people out of Egypt like a shepherd leads his sheep [SIM],
and he guided them while they walked through the desert.
53 He led them safely, and they were not afraid,
but their enemies were drowned in the sea.
54 Later he brought them to Canaan, his sacred land,
to Zion Hill (OR, the hilly area)
and by his power [MTY] he enabled them to conquer the people who were living
there.
55 He expelled the people-groups while his people were advancing;
he allotted part of the land for each tribe to possess,
and he gave to the Israeli people the houses of those people who had been
expelled.
56 However, the Israeli people rebelled against God, who is greater than any other
god,
and they did many evil things to see if they could do those things without God
punishing them,
and they did not obey his commandments.
57 Instead, like their ancestors did, they rebelled against God and ◄were not loyal to/
did not faithfully obey► him;
they were as unreliable as a crooked arrow that does not go straight [SIM].
58 Because they worshiped carved images of their gods on the tops of hills,
they caused God to become angry [DOU].
59 He saw what they were doing and became very angry,
so he rejected the Israeli people.
60 He no longer appeared to them at Shiloh
in the tent where he had lived among them.
61 He allowed their enemies to capture the sacred chest,
which was the symbol of his power and his glory.
62 Because he was angry with his people,
he allowed them to be killed [MTY] by their enemies.
63 Young men were killed in battles,
with the result that the young women had no one to marry.
64 Many priests were killed by their enemies’ swords,
PSALMS 78:65
857
PSALMS 79:9
and ◄the people did not allow the priests’ widows/the priests’ widows were not
allowed► to mourn.
65 Later, it was as though the Lord awoke from sleeping;
he was like a strong man who ◄became stimulated/felt that he was strong► by (OR,
66 He pushed their enemies back
and caused them to be very ashamed for a long time [HYP]
because they had been defeated.
67 But he did not set up his tent where the people of the tribe of Ephraim lived;
he did not choose their area to do that.
68 Instead he chose the area where the tribe of Judah lived;
he chose Zion Hill, which he loves.
69 He decided to have his temple built there, high up, like his home in heaven;
he caused it to be firm,
and intended that his temple would last forever, like the earth.
70 He chose David, who served him faithfully,
and took him from the pastures
71 where he was taking care of his father’s sheep,
and appointed him to be the leader [MET] of the Israeli people,
the people who belong to God.
72 David took care of the Israeli people sincerely and wholeheartedly,
and guided them skillfully/wisely.
79
A psalm written by Asaph
1 God, other people-groups have invaded your land.
They have ◄desecrated your temple/caused your temple to be unfit for worship►,
and they have destroyed all the buildings in Jerusalem.
2 Instead of burying the corpses of your people whom they killed,
they allowed vultures and wild animals to eat the flesh of those corpses,
3 When they killed your people,
your people’s blood flowed like water through the streets of Jerusalem,
and there was almost no one [HYP] left to bury their corpses.
4 The people-groups that live in countries that surround our land insult us;
they laugh at us and deride/belittle us.
5 Yahweh, how long will this continue?
Will you be angry with us forever?
Will your being angry destroy us like a burning fire destroys things?
6 Instead of being angry with us,
be angry with the people-groups that do not know/worship you!
Be angry with kingdoms whose people do not pray to you,
7 because they have killed Israeli people
and they have ruined your country.
8 Do not punish us because of the sins that our ancestors committed!
Be merciful to us now/quickly,
because we are very discouraged.
9 God, you have saved/rescued us many times,
PSALMS 79:10
858
PSALMS 80:9
so help us now;
in order that other people will honor you [MTY].
“If their God is very powerful, ◄surely he should help them/why does he not help
them►?”
Allow us to see you punishing the people of other nations in return for their shedding
our blood;
they have killed many of us, your people.
11 Listen to your people groaning while they are in prison,
execute.
12 In return for their having often insulted you,
punish them seven times as much!
13 After you do that, we, whom you take care of like a shepherd takes care of his sheep,
will continue praising you;
we will continue to praise you forever [HYP].
80
A psalm written by Asaph for the choir director, to be sung using the tune ‘Lilies of
the covenant’
1 Yahweh, you who lead us like a shepherd leads his flock of sheep,
listen to us Israeli people.
You sit on your throne in the Very Holy Place in the temple, above the carvings of
winged creatures.
2 Show yourself to the people of the tribes of Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh!
Show us that you are powerful
and come and rescue us!
3 God, cause our nation to be strong like it was before;
be kind to us [IDM] in order that we may be saved from our enemies.
4 Yahweh, you who are the commander of the armies of heaven,
how long will you be angry with us, your people, when we pray to you?
5 It is as though the only food and drink that you have given us is a cup full of our
tears!
6 You have allowed the people-groups that surround us to fight with each other to
decide which part of our land each of them will take;
our enemies laugh at us.
7 God, commander of the armies of heaven,
cause our nation to be strong like it was before!
Be kind to us in order that we may be saved!
8 Our ancestors were like a grapevine [MET] that you brought out of Egypt;
you expelled the other people-groups from this land,
and you put your people in their land.
you cleared out the people who were living in this land for us to live in it.
859
PSALMS 81:7
you enabled our ancestors to prosper and start living in towns all over this land.
10 Like huge grapevines cover the hills with their shade
and their branches are taller than big cedar trees [MET, HYP],
11 your people ruled all of Canaan, from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the
Euphrates River in the east.
12 So why have you abandoned us
and allowed our enemies to tear down our walls [RHQ]?
You are like someone who tears down the fences around his vineyard,
with the result that all the people who pass by can steal the grapes,
13 and wild pigs can trample the vines,
and wild animals can also eat the grapes.
14 You who are the commander of the armies of heaven, ◄turn to/stop abandoning►
us!
Look down from heaven and see what is happening to us!
Come and rescue us who are like [MET] your grapevine,
15 who are like the young vine that you [SYN] planted and caused to grow!
16 Our enemies have torn down and burned everything in our land;
look at them angrily and get rid of them!
17 But strengthen us people whom you have chosen [IDM],
us Israeli people whom you previously caused to be very strong.
18 When you do that, we will never turn away from you again;
◄revive us/cause us to be again like we were previously►, and then we will praise/
worship you.
19 Yahweh, commander of the armies of heaven, restore us;
be kind to us in order that we may be rescued from our enemies!
81
A psalm written by Asaph for the choir director
1 Sing songs to praise God, who enables us to be strong when we fight our enemies;
shout joyfully to God, whom we ◄descendants of Jacob/Israeli people► worship!
2 Start playing the music, and beat the tambourines,
3 Blow the trumpets during the festival to celebrate each new moon
and each time the moon is full and during our other festivals.
4 Do that because that is a law for us Israeli people;
God commanded it for us descendants of Jacob.
5 He commanded us Israeli people to obey it when he punished the people of Egypt.
I heard someone [MTY] whose voice I did not recognize, saying,
6 “After the rulers of Egypt forced you Israelis to work as slaves,
I took those heavy burdens off your backs,
and I enabled you to lay down those heavy baskets of bricks that you were
carrying.
7 When you were greatly distressed, you called out to me, and I rescued you;
I answered you out of a thundercloud.
860
PSALMS 82:8
Later I tested whether you would trust me to give you water when you were in the
desert at Meribah.
(Think about that!)
8 You who are my people, listen while I warn you!
I wish that you Israeli people would pay attention to what I say to you!
9 You must not have any idols of other gods among you;
you must never bow to worship any of them!
10 I am Yahweh, your God;
It was not any of those other gods who brought you out of Egypt,
I am the one who did it!
So ask me what you want me to do for you [MTY], and I will do it.
11 But my people would not listen to me [SYN];
they would not obey me.
12 So even though they were very stubborn,
I allowed them to do whatever they wanted to do.
13 I wish that my people would listen to me,
that the Israeli people would behave as I want them to do.
14 If they did that, I would quickly defeat their enemies;
I would strike/punish all of them [DOU].
15 Then all those who hate me would ◄cringe before/bow down to► me,
and then I would punish them [MTY] forever.
16 But I would give you Israelis very good wheat/grain,
and I would fill your stomachs with wild honey.”
82
1 God gathers all the rulers and judges who think they are gods for a meeting in heaven;
and he tells them that he has decided this:
2 “You must [RHQ] stop judging people unfairly;
you must no longer make decisions that favor wicked people!
3 You must defend people who are poor and orphans;
(Think about that!)
you must act fairly toward those who are needy and those who have no one to
help them.
4 Rescue them from the power [MTY] of evil people [DOU]!”
5 Those rulers do not know or understand anything!
They are very corrupt/evil,
and as a result of their corrupt/evil behavior,
it is as though the foundation of the world is being shaken!
6 I the all-powerful God, previously said to them, “You think you are gods!
It is as though you are all my sons,
7 but you will die like people do;
your lives will end, like the lives of all rulers end.”
8 God, arise and judge everyone on [MTY] the earth,
because all the people-groups belong to you!
PSALMS 83:1
861
PSALMS 84:1
83
A psalm which is a song written by Asaph
1 God, do not continue to be silent!
Do not be quiet and say nothing,
2 because your enemies are rioting against you;
they are ◄conspiring together against/planning how to defeat► the people whom
you protect.
4 They say, “Come, we must destroy their nation,
with the result that no one will remember that Israel ever existed!”
5 They have agreed on what they want to do to destroy Israel,
and they have formed an alliance against you.
6 The people who have done that are the people of Edom region,
the descendants of Ishmael who live on the east side of the Jordan River,
the Moab people-group, the descendants of Hagar who also live on the east side of
the Jordan River,
7 Gebal people-group, the Ammon people-group, the Amalek people-group,
the Philistia people-group, and the people of Tyre city.
8 The people of Assyria have joined them;
they are strong allies of the Moab and Ammon people-groups, who are descendants
of Abraham’s nephew Lot.
(Think about that!)
9 God, do to those people things like you did to the Midian people-group,
like you did to Sisera and Jabin at Kishon River.
10 You destroyed them at Endor town,
and their corpses lay on the ground and decayed.
11 Do to them things like you did to Kings Oreb and Zeeb;
defeat their leaders like you defeated Zebah and Zalmunna,
12 who said, “We will take for ourselves the land that the Israelis say belongs to
God!”
13 My God, cause them to disappear quickly like whirling dust,
like chaff that the wind blows away!
14 Like a fire completely burns a forest
and like flames burn in the mountains,
15 expel them by sending storms;
cause them to be terrified by your big storms/hurricanes!
16 Cause them [SYN] to be very ashamed
in order that they will admit that you are very powerful.
17 Cause them to be forever disgraced because of being defeated,
and cause them to die while they are still disgraced.
18 Cause them to know that you, whose name is Yahweh,
are the supreme ruler over everything on the earth.
84
A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah for the choir director
862
PSALMS 85:3
2 I [SYN] would like to be there;
Yahweh, I desire that very much [DOU].
With all of my inner being I sing joyfully to you, the all-powerful God.
3 Even sparrows and swallows have built nests near your temple, where you protect
them [DOU];
they take care of their young babies near the altars where people offer sacrifices
to you,
who are the commander of the armies of heaven, and my king and my God.
4 ◄Happy are/You are pleased with► those who ◄live/continually worship► in your
temple,
constantly singing to praise you.
(Think about that!)
5 Happy are those who know that you are the one who causes them to be strong,
those who strongly desire to ◄make the trip/go► to Zion Hill.
6 While they travel through the dry Baca Valley,
you cause it to become a place where there are springs of water,
where the rains ◄in the autumn/before the cold season► fill the valley with pools
of water.
7 As a result, those who travel through there become stronger/refreshed
knowing that they will appear in your presence ◄on Zion Hill/in Jerusalem►.
8 Yahweh, commander of the armies of heaven, listen to my prayer;
God, who is worshiped by us ◄descendants of Jacob/Israeli people►, hear [IDM] what
I am saying!
(Think about that!)
9 God, be kind to [IDM] our king, the one who protects us [MTY],
the one whom you have chosen [MTY] to rule us.
10 For me, spending one day in your temple
is better than spending 1,000 days somewhere else;
standing at the entrance to your temple, ready to go inside,
is better than living in the tents/homes where wicked people live.
11 Yahweh our God is like the sun that shines on us and like a shield that protects us
[MET];
he is kind to us and honors us.
Yahweh does not refuse to give any good thing/blessing to those who do what is right.
12 Yahweh, commander of the armies of heaven,
◄happy are/you are pleased with► those who trust in you!
A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah for the choir director
1 Yahweh, you have been kind to us people who live in this land;
you have enabled us Israeli people to become prosperous again.
you pardoned us for all our sins [DOU].
(Think about that!)
3 You stopped being angry with us
and turned away from severely punishing us.
PSALMS 85:4
863
PSALMS 86:9
4 Now, God, the one who saves/rescues us, ◄restore us/make us prosperous again►
and stop being angry with us!
5 ◄Will you continue to be angry with us forever?/Please do not continue to be angry
with us forever.► [DOU, RHQ]
6 Please enable us [RHQ] to prosper again
in order that we, your people, will rejoice about what you have done for us.
7 Yahweh, by rescuing us from our troubles/difficulties,
show us that you faithfully love us.
8 I want to listen to what Yahweh our God says,
because he promises/says that he will enable us, his people, to live peacefully,
if we do not return to doing foolish things.
9 He is surely ready to save/rescue those who revere him,
in order that his glory/splendor will be seen in our land.
10 When that happens, he will both faithfully love us and faithfully do for us what he
promised to do [PRS];
and we will act/behave righteously, and he will give us peace,
which will be like a kiss that he gives us.
11 Here on earth, we will ◄be loyal to/continually believe in► God,
and from heaven, God will act justly/fairly toward us.
12 Yes, Yahweh will do good things for us,
and there will be great harvests in our land.
13 Yahweh always acts righteously [PRS, MET];
he acts righteously wherever he goes.
A prayer written by David
86
1 Yahweh, listen [IDM] to what I say and answer me,
because I am weak and needy.
2 Prevent me from dying now, because I ◄am loyal to/continue to believe in► you;
save/rescue me, because I serve you and I trust in you, my God.
3 Lord, be kind to me,
because I cry out to you all during the day.
4 Lord, cause me to be glad,
because I ◄pray to/worship► [IDM] you.
5 Lord, you are good to us, and you forgive us;
you faithfully love very much all those who ◄pray/call out► to you.
6 Lord, listen to my prayer;
hear me when I cry out to you to help me.
7 When I have troubles, I call out to you,
because you answer me.
8 Lord, among all the gods whom the heathen nations worship,
there is no one like you;
not one of them has done the great things that you have done.
9 Lord, some day, people from all the nations that you have established will come and
bow down in front of you
and they will praise you [MTY].
PSALMS 86:10
864
PSALMS 87:7
10 You are great, and you do wonderful/marvelous things;
only you are God.
11 Yahweh, teach me what you want me to do
in order that I may conduct my life according to what you say, which is true.
Cause/Teach me to revere you.
12 Lord, my God, I will thank you with all my inner being,
and I will praise you forever.
13 You faithfully love me very much;
you have prevented me from dying and going to the place where dead people are.
14 But God, proud men are trying to attack me;
a gang/group of cruel men are wanting to kill me;
they are men who do not have any ◄respect for/interest in► you.
15 But Lord, you always are mercifully and kind;
you do not become angry quickly,
you faithfully love us very much
and always do for us what you have promised to do.
16 Look down toward me and be merciful to me;
cause me to be strong and save/rescue me
who serves you faithfully like my mother did.
17 Yahweh, do something to show me that you are being good to me
me,
A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah
1 The city that Yahweh established is on his sacred hill.
2 He loves that city, Jerusalem, more than he loves any other city in Israel.
3 You people in [APO] the city that God ◄owns/lives in►,
people say wonderful things about your city.
(Think about that!)
4 Some of those who know about God are the people of Egypt and Babylonia,
and also the people of Philistia and Tyre and Ethiopia;
some day they all will say,
“Although I was not born in Jerusalem,
because I belong to Yahweh, it is as though I was born there.”
5 And concerning Jerusalem, people will say
“It is as though everyone was born there,
and Almighty God will cause that city to remain strong/safe/secure.”
6 Yahweh will write a list of the names of the people of various groups who belong to
him,
and he will say that he considers them all to be citizens of Jerusalem.
(Think about that!)
7 They will all dance and sing, saying,
“Jerusalem is the source of all our blessings.”
PSALMS 88:1
865
A psalm that expresses sadness, written for the choir director by Zerah’s son Heman,
1 Yahweh God, you who rescues me, all during each day I call out to you to help me,
2 Listen [IDM] to my prayer [DOU],
3 I have experienced many troubles/difficulties,
and I am about to die [MTY] and go where dead people are.
other people also consider that I will soon die.
5 I am like a corpse that has been abandoned;
I am like dead people who lie in their graves,
people who have been completely forgotten,
because you do not take care of them any more.
6 It is as though you have thrown me into a deep, dark pit,
into a place where they throw corpses.
7 It seems like you are very angry with me,
and it is as though you have crushed me like ocean waves crash down on people [MET].
(Think about that!)
8 You have caused my friends to ◄avoid/stay away from► me;
I have become repulsive to them.
It is as though I am in a prison and cannot escape.
9 My eyes cannot see well because I cry very much.
Yahweh, every day I call out to you to help me;
I lift up my hands to you while I pray.
10 You certainly do not [RHQ] perform miracles for dead people!
Their spirits do not [RHQ] arise to praise you!
(Think about that!)
11 Corpses in the grave certainly do not tell about your faithfully loving us [RHQ],
and in the place where people are finally destroyed,
no one tells about what you faithfully do for us [RHQ].
12 No one in the deep dark pit ever sees the miracles that you perform [RHQ],
and no one in the place where people have been completely forgotten tells about
your being good to us.
13 But as for me, Yahweh, I cry out to you to help me;
each morning I pray to you.
14 Yahweh, why do you reject me [RHQ]?
Why do you turn away from me [RHQ]?
15 All the time since I was young, I have suffered and have often almost died;
have done to me.
16 I feel that you have crushed me because of your being angry with me;
the terrible things that you are doing to me are almost destroying me.
17 I feel as though they surround me like a flood [SIM];
PSALMS 88:18
866
PSALMS 89:17
they are ◄closing in on/crushing► me from all sides.
18 You have caused even my friends and others whom I love to avoid me,
and it is as though the only friend that I have is darkness.
89
A song written by Ethan, from the clan of Ezra
1 Yahweh, I will sing forever about the ways you faithfully love me;
people not yet born will hear that you faithfully do all that you have promised.
2 I will tell people that you will faithfully love us forever,
and that your being faithful to do what you have promised is as permanent as the
sky.
3 Yahweh said, “I have made an agreement with David, whom I chose to serve me.
I have made this solemn ◄agreement with/promise to► him:
4 ‘I will enable various ones of your descendants to always be kings;
the line of kings descended from you [MTY] will never end.’ ”
(Think about that!) 10
5 Yahweh, I desire that all those beings who are in [MTY] heaven will praise you for
the wonderful things that you do,
and that all your holy angels will sing about how you faithfully do what you
promise.
6 There is no one [RHQ] in heaven who can be compared with you, Yahweh.
There are no angels [RHQ] in heaven who are equal to you.
7 When your holy angels gather together,
they declare that you must be revered;
they say that you are more awesome than all the angels that surround your throne!
8 O Yahweh, God Almighty, there is no one [RHQ] who is powerful like you are;
your faithfully doing all that you promise is like a cloak that [MET] always
surrounds you.
11 The heavens are yours, and the earth is yours;
and everything on the earth is yours, because you created it all.
12 You created everything from the north to the south.
Tabor Mountain and Hermon Mountain joyfully praise you [MTY].
13 ◄You/Your arms► are very powerful;
◄you/your hands► are extremely strong.
14 ◄Your rule [MTY] over us is based on/As you rule over us, you are always► treating
people fairly and justly,
and on/are always faithfully loving us and doing what you promised.
15 Yahweh, happy are the people who worship you with joyful shouts,
who live knowing that you are always watching over them.
16 Every day, throughout the day, they rejoice in what you [MTY] have done,
and they praise you for being very good to them.
17 You give us your glorious strength;
because you act in our favor, we defeat [MET] our enemies.
PSALMS 89:18
867
PSALMS 89:39
18 Yahweh, you gave us the one who protects us [MET];
you, the holy God whom we Israelis worship, chose a king for us.
19 Long ago you spoke in a vision to one of your servants/prophets, saying,
“I have helped a famous soldier;
I chose him from among all the people to be a king.
20 That man is David, the one who will serve me faithfully,
and I anointed him with sacred olive oil to make him king.
21 I [MTY] will always strengthen him;
with my power [MTY] I will make him strong.
22 His enemies will never find ways to defeat him,
and wicked people will never defeat him.
23 I will crush his enemies in front of him
and get rid of those who hate him.
24 I will always be loyal to him and faithfully love him
and enable him to defeat [MET] his enemies.
Mediterranean Sea to the Euphrates River.
my God, the one who protects [MET] and saves me.’
he will be the greatest king on the earth.
28 I will always be loyal to him,
and my agreement to bless him will last forever.
29 I will establish a line of his descendants that will never end,
various ones of his descendants will always be kings.
30 But, if some of his descendants disobey my laws,
and do not not behave like my commands say that they should,
31 if they disregard my requirements
and do not do the right things that I have told them to do,
32 I will punish them severely [MTY]
and cause them to suffer for doing wrong.
33 But I will not stop faithfully loving David,
and I will always do what I promised him.
34 I will not break the agreement that I made with him;
I will not change even one word that I spoke to him.
35 Once I made a solemn promise to David, and that will never change,
and because I am God, I will never lie to David.
36 I promised that the line of kings descended from him will go on forever;
it will last as long as the sun shines.
37 That line will ◄be as permanent/last as long► as the moon
that is always watching everything from the sky.
Think about that!)
38 But Yahweh, now you have rejected [DOU] David!
You are very angry with the king whom you appointed.
39 It seems that you have broken the agreement that you made with your servant,
David;
it seems as though you have signaled that he is no longer the king by throwing
his crown into the dust/dirt.
40 You have torn down the walls that protect his city,
and allowed all his forts to become ruins.
41 All those who pass by plunder/steal his possessions;
his neighbors ◄laugh at/ridicule► him.
42 You have enabled his enemies to defeat him;
you have made them all happy.
43 You have caused his sword to become useless,
and you have not helped him in his battles.
44 You have caused his splendor to end (OR, You have taken away his power
by knocking his throne to the ground.
45 You have caused him to look old when he is still young
and caused him to be very shamed/disgraced.
(Think about that!)
46 O Yahweh, how long will this continue?
Will you hide yourself forever?
How long will your anger burn like a fire?
47 Do not forget that life is very short;
have you created all us people in vain?
48 No one can [RHQ] keep on living and never die;
◄No one can [RHQ] avoid going/Everyone will go► to the place of the dead.
(Think about that!)
49 Yahweh, you promised long ago
that you would faithfully love us;
why are you not doing that?
You solemnly promised that to David!
50 Yahweh, do not forget that people insult me!
◄Heathen people/People who do not know you► curse me!
51 Yahweh, your enemies insult your chosen king!
They insult/ridicule him wherever he goes.
52 I hope/desire that Yahweh will be praised forever!
Amen! May it be so!
A prayer by the prophet Moses
2 Before you created the mountains,
before you formed the earth and everything that is in it,
you were eternally God,
and you will be God forever.
3 When people die, you cause their corpses to become soil again;
you change their corpses to become dirt like the first man was created from.
4 When you ◄consider/think about► time,
1,000 years are as short as [SIM] one day which passes;
you consider that [HYP] they are as short as a few hours in the night.
PSALMS 90:5
869
PSALMS 91:4
5 You cause people suddenly to die [MET];
they live only a short time, like a dream lasts only a short time.
They are like grass/weeds [SIM] that grow up.
6 In the morning [DOU] the grass sprouts and grows well,
but in the evening it dries up and ◄completely withers/dies►.
7 Similarly, because of the sins that we have committed, you become angry with us;
you terrify us and then you destroy us.
8 It is as though you place our sins in front of you,
you spread out even our secret sins where you can see them.
9 Because you are angry with us, you cause our lives to end;
the years that we live pass as quickly as a sigh does.
10 People live for only 70 years;
but if they are strong, some of them live for 80 years.
But even during good years we have much pain and troubles;
our lives soon end, and we die [EUP].
11 No one [RHQ] has fully experienced the powerful things you can do to them when
you are angry with them,
and people are not afraid that you will greatly punish them because of your being
angry with them.
12 So teach/help us to realize that we live for only a short time
13 Yahweh, how long will you be angry with us?
Pity us who serve you.
14 Each morning show us that your faithfully loving us is enough for us
in order that we may shout joyfully and be happy for the rest of our lives.
15 Cause us to now be as happy for as many years as you ◄afflicted us/caused us to
be sad► and we experienced troubles.
16 Enable us to see the great things that you do
and enable our descendants to also see your glorious power.
17 Lord, our God, give us your blessings
and enable us to be successful;
yes, cause us to be successful in everything that we do [DOU]!
91
1 Those who live under the protection of God Almighty,
will be able to rest safely under his care.
2 I will declare to Yahweh,
“You protect me;
you are like a fort [MET] in which I am safe.
You are my God, the one in whom I trust.”
3 Yahweh will rescue you from all hidden traps
and save you from deadly diseases.
4 He will shield/protect you like a bird shields/protects its chicks [MET] with/under her
wings.
You will be safe ◄in his care/because he takes care of you►.
PSALMS 91:5
870
PSALMS 92:6
His faithfully doing what he has promised is like a shield [MET] that will protect
you.
5 You will not be afraid of things that happen during the night that could ◄terrorize
you/cause you to be very afraid►,
or of arrows that your enemies will shoot at you during the day.
6 You will not be afraid of ◄plagues/widespread sicknesses► that demons cause when
or of other evil forces that kill people at midday.
even if 10,000 people are dying around you,
you will not be harmed.
8 Look and see
that ◄wicked people are being punished/God is punishing wicked people►!
9 If you allow Yahweh to protect you,
if you trust God Almighty to ◄shelter/take care of► you,
10 nothing evil will happen to you;
no plague will come near your house,
11 because Yahweh will command his angels
to protect you wherever you go.
12 They will hold you up with their hands,
with the result that you will not hurt your foot on a big stone.
13 You will be kept safe from being harmed by your enemies [MET];
it will be as though you are stepping on lions and poisonous snakes without them
harming you!
14 Yahweh says, “I will rescue those who love me,
I will protect them because they ◄acknowledge that I am Yahweh/know me►.
15 When they call out to me, I will answer them.
I will help them when they are experiencing trouble;
I will rescue them and honor them.
16 I will reward them by enabling them to live a long time,
and I will save them.”
92
A psalm that is to be sung on Sabbath days
1 Yahweh, it is good for people to thank you
and to sing to praise you [MTY] who are greater than any other god.
2 It is good to proclaim every morning that you faithfully love us,
and each night to sing songs that declare that you always do what you have
promised to do,
3 accompanied by musicians playing harps that have ten strings,
and by the sounds made by a lyre.
4 Yahweh, you have caused me to be glad;
I sing joyfully because of what you [SYN] have done.
5 Yahweh, the things that you do are great!
But it is difficult for us to understand all that you think.
6 There are things that you do that foolish people cannot know about,
things that stupid people cannot understand.
PSALMS 92:7
871
PSALMS 94:3
7 They do not understand that although the number of wicked people increases like
blades of grass do [SIM],
and they prosper,
they will be completely destroyed.
8 But Yahweh, you will ◄be exalted/be honored/rule► forever.
9 Yahweh, your enemies will certainly die,
and those who do wicked things will be defeated/scattered.
10 But you have caused me to be as strong [MTY] as [SIM] a wild ox;
you have caused me to be very joyful [MTY].
11 I [SYN] have seen you defeat my enemies;
d I have heard those evil men wail/scream while they were being slaughtered.
12 But righteous people will prosper like [SIM] palm trees that grow well,
or like [SIM] cedar trees that grow in Lebanon.
13 They are like the trees that grow near the temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem,
14 Even when righteous people become old, they do many things [IDM] that please
God.
15 That shows that Yahweh is just;
he is like a huge rock under which I am safe/protected,
and he never does anything that is wicked/wrong.
1 Yahweh, you are the King!
93
You are majestic, and the power that you have is like [MET] a robe that a king
You put the world firmly in place, and it will never be moved/shaken.
you have always existed.
3 Yahweh, when you created the world, you separated the water from the chaotic mass
and formed oceans,
and the waves of the waters of those oceans still roar,
4 but you are greater than the roar of those oceans,
more powerful than the ocean waves!
You are Yahweh, the one who is greater than any other god!
5 Yahweh, your laws never change,
and your temple has always been holy/sacred.
And that will be true forever.
94
1 Yahweh, you are able to get revenge on your enemies.
So show them that you are going to punish them!
2 You are the one who judges all people on the earth;
so arise, and give/punish the proud leaders of our people like they deserve.
3 Yahweh, how long will those wicked people be glad/happy?
PSALMS 94:4
872
PSALMS 94:22
It is not right that [RHQ] they continue being glad!
4 They do evil things, and they boast about doing them;
how long will they be allowed to continue doing that?
5 Yahweh, it is as though those wicked people crush us, your people;
they ◄oppress/treat cruelly► those who belong to you [DOU].
6 They murder widows and orphans
and people from other countries who think it is safe to live in our land.
7 Those wicked people say, “Yahweh does not see anything;
so the God whom those Israelis worship does not see the evil things that we do.”
8 You evil people who rule Israel, you are foolish and stupid;
He created our eyes;
10 He also scolds the leaders of other nations;
so do you think that he will not punish you [RHQ]?
He is the one who knows everything;
so why do you think that he does not know what you do [RHQ]?
11 Yahweh knows everything that people are thinking;
he knows that what they think ◄is useless/vanishes as quickly as► smoke [MET].
12 Yahweh, you are pleased with people who want you to discipline/correct them,
those who want you to teach them your laws.
13 When those people have had troubles, you cause those troubles to cease,
and some day it will be as though you will dig pits for wicked people,
and they will fall into those pits and die.
14 Yahweh will not abandon his people;
he will not desert like that those who belong to him [DOU].
15 Some day judges will decide matters fairly for people,
and all honest/righteous people will be pleased about that.
16 But when wicked people ◄oppressed me/treated me cruelly►,
◄who defended me?/no one defended me.► [RHQ]
No one stood up to testify for me against those evil people [RHQ].
17 If Yahweh had not helped me at that time,
I would have been executed,
and my soul/spirit would have gone to the place where dead people say nothing.
18 I said/thought to myself, “I am about to die,”
but Yahweh, you held me up by faithfully loving me.
19 Whenever I am very worried,
you comfort/encourage me and cause me to be happy.
20 You have nothing to do with wicked judges,
who establish laws that allow people to do what is not legal.
21 They plan to get rid of righteous people,
and they declare that ◄innocent people/people who have not done what is wrong►
must be executed.
22 But Yahweh ◄has become like my fortress/protects me► [MET];
PSALMS 94:23
873
PSALMS 96:5
my God is like a huge rock under which I am protected/safe [MET].
23 He will punish those wicked leaders in return for the wicked things that they have
done,
and will get rid of them for the sins that they have committed;
yes, Yahweh our God will ◄wipe them out/destroy them completely►.
1 Come, sing to Yahweh;
95
sing joyfully to the one who protects us [MET] and saves us!
2 We should thank him as we come before him,
and sing ◄joyful songs/joyfully► as we praise him.
3 Because Yahweh is the great God,
he is a great king who rules over all other gods.
4 He rules over the whole earth,
from the deepest places/caves to the highest mountains.
5 The seas are his, because he made them.
He is also the one who [SYN] formed/made the dry land.
6 We should come, worship, and bow down before him.
like sheep that a shepherd takes care of.
Today, listen to what Yahweh is saying to you.
8 He says, “Do not become stubborn [IDM] like your ancestors did at Meribah,
and like they did at Massah in the desert.
9 There your ancestors ◄wanted to see/tried to determine► if they could do many
very evil things without my punishing them.
Even though they had seen me perform many miracles, they tested whether I
would continue to be patient with them.
10 For 40 years I was angry with those people,
and I said, ‘Those people say that they want to please me, but they do things that
I detest.
They refuse to obey my commands.’
11 So because I was very angry, I solemnly said/declared about them:
‘They will never enter the land of Canaan where I would have allowed them to
rest!’ ”
1 Sing to Yahweh a new song!
96
You people throughout the earth, sing to Yahweh!
2 Sing to Yahweh and praise him [MTY]!
Every day proclaim to others that he has saved/rescued us.
3 Tell about his glory/greatness to all people-groups;
tell all people-groups the marvelous things that he has done.
4 Yahweh is great, and he deserves to be praised very much;
he should be revered more than for all the gods,
5 because all the gods that other people-groups worship are only idols,
PSALMS 96:6
874
PSALMS 97:9
but Yahweh is truly great; he created the skies!
6 Those who are in his presence honor him and can see that he is a great king.
They can see in his temple that he is very powerful and is very beautiful.
7 You people in nations all over the earth, praise Yahweh!
Praise Yahweh for his glorious power [HEN]!
8 Praise Yahweh like he deserves to be praised,
Bring an offering and come to his temple.
9 Bow down before Yahweh when he appears in his holy/sacred temple;
everyone on the earth should tremble in front of him,
because he is majestic and holy.
10 Say to all the people-groups, “Yahweh is the king!
He put the world in its place, and nothing will ever be able to move/shake it.
He will judge all the people-groups fairly.”
the earth should rejoice.
Yahweh.
When they do that, it will be as though all the trees in the forests will sing joyfully
13 in front of Yahweh.
That will happen when he comes to judge everyone on [MTY] the earth.
He will judge all the people fairly/justly, according to what he knows is true.
1 Yahweh is the king!
97
I want everyone on the earth to be glad/happy,
and the people who live on the islands in the oceans to also rejoice about that!
2 There are very dark clouds around him to hide him;
he rules [MTY] righteously/justly and fairly.
3 He sends fire in front of him,
and he completely burns all his enemies in that fire.
4 All around the world he causes lightning to flash;
people on the earth see it, and it causes them to be afraid and tremble.
5 The mountains/hills melt like wax in front of Yahweh,
the one who is the Lord, who rules over all the earth.
6 The angels in [MTY] heaven proclaim that he acts righteously,
and all the people-groups see his glory.
7 Everyone who worships idols should be ashamed;
all those who are proud of their false gods should realize that their gods are
useless,
It is as though all those gods bow down to worship Yahweh.
8 The people [MTY] of Jerusalem hear about Yahweh and are glad/happy,
and people in the other [MTY] cities in Judah also rejoice,
because Yahweh judges and punishes wicked people.
9 Yahweh is the supreme king over all the earth;
he has very great power, and all the other gods have no power at all.
PSALMS 97:10
875
PSALMS 99:5
he protects the lives of his people,
and he rescues them when the wicked people try to harm them.
11 His light shines on righteous people;
he causes those who are righteous to rejoice.
12 You righteous people, rejoice about what Yahweh has done,
A psalm
1 Sing to Yahweh a new song,
because he has done wonderful things!
By his power [MTY] and his great strength [DOU] he has defeated his enemies.
2 Yahweh has declared to people that he has defeated his enemies;
he has revealed that he has punished them,
and people in all the world have seen that he has done it.
3 Like he promised to us Israeli people [MTY],
he has faithfully loved us and ◄been loyal to/not abandoned► us.
People who live in very remote places in all the earth
have seen that our God has defeated his enemies.
4 All you people [MTY] everywhere should sing joyfully to Yahweh;
praise him while you sing and shout joyfully!
5 Praise Yahweh while you play the lyres/harps,
playing delightful music.
6 Some of you should blow trumpets and other horns,
while others shout joyfully to Yahweh, our king.
7 The oceans and all the creatures that are in the oceans should roar to praise Yahweh.
Everyone on the earth should sing!
8 It should seem as though the rivers are clapping their hands to praise Yahweh
and that the hills are singing together joyfully in front of Yahweh,
9 because he will come to judge everyone on [MTY] the earth!
He will judge all the people-groups in the world justly and fairly [DOU].
1 Yahweh is the supreme king,

so all the people-groups should tremble ◄in his presence/in front of him►!
He sits on his throne in the temple above the statues of winged creatures,
so the earth should quake/shake!
2 Yahweh is a mighty king in Jerusalem;
but he is also the supreme ruler of all people-groups.
3 So they should praise him because he is very great/powerful;

Worship him in front of the Sacred Chest in his temple [MTY],
where he rules people.
PSALMS 99:6
876
PSALMS 101:4
He is holy!
6 Moses and Aaron were two of his priests;
Samuel also was someone who prayed to him.
Those three cried out to Yahweh to help them,
and he answered them.
7 He spoke to Moses and Aaron from the cloud that was like a huge pillar;
they obeyed all the laws and commandments [DOU] that he gave to them.
8 Yahweh, our God, you answered your people
when they cried out to you to help them;
you are a God who forgave them for those sins that they had committed,
even though you punished them for the things that they did that are wrong.
9 Praise Yahweh, our God,
and worship him at the temple on his sacred hill;
it is right to do that because Yahweh, our God, is holy!
A psalm of thanksgiving

We are the people that he takes care of [MET];
we are like sheep that are cared for by their shepherd.
4 Enter the gates of his temple thanking him;

Thank him and praise him,
5 because Yahweh always does good things for us.
He faithfully loves us,

A psalm written by David
101
1 Yahweh, I will sing to you!
I will sing about your faithfully loving us (OR, my being loyal to you and acting justly/
fairly toward people).
2 I promise that while I rule people [MTY],
I will behave in such a way that no one will be able to criticize me.
Yahweh, ◄when will you come to help me?/I need you to come to help me.► [RHQ]
3 I will not allow stay away from those who do what is evil [SYN].
I hate the deeds of those who ◄turn away from/sin against► you;

and I will allow them to ◄live with/work for► me.
I will allow those who behave in such a way that no one can criticize them to
◄serve me/be my officials►.
7 I will not allow anyone who deceives others to work in my palace;
no one who tells lies will be allowed to continually come to work for me.
8 Every day I will try to get rid of all the wicked people in this land;
I will do that by expelling them from this city, which is Yahweh’s city.
102
A prayer written by someone who was afflicted, when he was discouraged and
pleaded for Yahweh to help him
1 Yahweh, listen to what I am praying;
hear me while I cry out to you!
2 Do not ◄turn away/hide yourself► from me when I ◄have troubles/am distressed►!
Listen to me,
and answer me quickly now, when I am calling out to you!
3 My life is ending, like smoke that disappears [SIM];
I have a high fever which burns my body like a fire burns [SIM].
4 I feel like I am drying up like grass [SIM] that has been beaten/trampled down,
and I no longer have a desire to eat food.
5 I groan loudly,
and my bones can be seen under my skin because I have become very thin.
6 I am like a lonely and despised vulture in the desert,
like an owl by itself in the abandoned ruins of a building/city.
7 I lie awake at night;
because there is no one to comfort me,
I am like a lonely bird sitting on a housetop [SIM].
8 All during the day my enemies insult me;
those who make fun of me mention my name
and say, “May you be like him” when they curse people.
9-10 Because you are very angry [DOU] with me,
now I sit in ashes while I am suffering greatly;
and those ashes fall on the bread/food that I eat,
and what I drink has my tears mixed with it.
11 My time to remain alive is like an evening shadow that will soon be gone [SIM].
12 But Yahweh, you are our king who rules [MTY] forever;
people who are not yet born will remember you.
13 You will arise and be merciful to the people of [MTY] Jerusalem;
PSALMS 102:14
878
PSALMS 103:4
this is the time for you to be kind to them.
14 Even though ◄the city has been destroyed/our enemies have destroyed our city►,
we who serve you still love the stones that were formerly in the city walls;
we, your people, are very sad when we see it.
15 Yahweh, some day the people of other nations will revere you [MTY];
all the kings on earth will see that you are very glorious/great.
16 You will rebuild Jerusalem,
and you will appear there with your glory/brightness.
17 You will listen to the prayers of your people who are homeless,
and you will ◄not ignore them/do what they request► [LIT]
when they plead with you to help them.
18 Yahweh, I want to write these words
in order that people in future years will know what you have done,
in order that people who are not born yet will praise you.
19 They will know that you looked down from your holy/sacred place in heaven [DOU]
and saw what was happening on the earth.
20 They will know that you hear prisoners groaning
and that you will set free those who have been told, “You will be executed.”
21 As a result, people in Jerusalem will praise you [DOU] for what you have done
22 when many people from other people-groups and those who are citizens of other
kingdoms gather to worship you.
23 But now you have caused me to become weak while I am still young;
I think that I will ◄not live much longer/ very long/soon die►.
24 I say to you, “My God, do not cause me to die now,
before I become old!
You live forever!
25 You created the world long ago,
and you made ◄the heavens/everything in the sky► with your own hands.
They will wear out like clothes wear out.
and they will no longer exist,
27 but you are not like the things that you created,
because you are always the same;
you never die.
28 Some day our children will live safely in Jerusalem,
and their descendants will be protected in your presence.”
A psalm written by David
103
1 I tell myself that I should praise Yahweh.
I will praise him [MTY] with all of my inner being, because he [MTY] is holy.
2 I tell myself that I should praise Yahweh
and never forget all the kind things he has done for me:
3 He forgives all my sins,
and he heals me from all my diseases/sicknesses;
4 he keeps me from dying [MTY],
PSALMS 103:5
879
PSALMS 104:1
and blesses me by faithfully loving me and acting mercifully to me.
5 He gives me good things during my entire life.
He makes me feel young and strong like eagles.
6 Yahweh judges justly and ◄vindicates/does what is right for► all those who have
been treated unfairly.
7 Long ago he revealed to Moses what he planned to do;
he showed to the ancestors of us Israeli people the mighty things that he was able
to do.
8 Yahweh acts mercifully and kindly;
he does not quickly ◄get angry/punish us► when we sin;
he is always showing us that he faithfully loves us.
9 He will not keep rebuking us,
10 He punishes us for our sins,
11 The skies are very high above the earth,
12 He has taken away the guilt for [MTY] our sins,
13 Just like parents act mercifully toward their children,
Yahweh is kind to those who revere him.
14 He knows what our bodies are like;
he remembers that he created us from dirt,
and so we quickly fail to do what pleases him [MET].
15 We humans do not live forever [SIM];
we are like grass [SIM] that withers and dies.
We are like wild flowers: They bloom for a short while,
16 but then the hot wind blows over them, and they disappear;
no one sees them again.
17 But Yahweh will faithfully keep loving forever
all those who revere him.
He will act fairly to our children and to their children;
18 he will act that way to all those who obey the agreement he made with them to
bless them if they did what he told them to do,
to all those who obey what he has commanded.
19 Yahweh made/caused the heavens to be the place where he rules [MTY];
from there he rules over everything.
20 You angels who belong to Yahweh, praise him!
You are powerful creatures/beings who do what he tells you to do;
you obey what he commands.
21 Praise Yahweh, you armies/thousands of angels who serve him and do what he
desires!
22 All you things that Yahweh has created, praise him;
praise him in every place where he rules, everywhere!
And I also will praise Yahweh!
104
1 I tell myself that I should praise Yahweh.
PSALMS 104:2
880
PSALMS 104:21
Yahweh, my God, you are very great!
Like a king has on his royal robes [MET],
you have honor and majesty/greatness all around you!
2 You created/caused light to be like your robe [MET].
You spread out the sky like a man sets up a tent.
3 You made/put your home in heaven, above the rain clouds in the sky, like a man
puts the rafters of his house in place [MET].
4 You caused the winds to be like your messengers [MET],
5 You placed the world firmly on its foundation
so that it can never be moved/shaken.
6 Later, you covered the earth with a flood, like a blanket,
with the water that covered the mountains.
7 But when you rebuked the water, the oceans receded;
your voice spoke like thunder,
and then the waters rushed away.
8 Mountains rose up from the water,
and the valleys sank down
to the levels that you had determined for them.
9 Then you set a boundary for the oceans, a boundary that they cannot cross;
their water will never again cover the whole earth.
10 You make/cause springs to pour water into ravines;
their water flows down between the mountains.
11 Those streams provide water for all the animals to drink;
the wild donkeys drink the water and are no longer thirsty.
12 Birds make their nests alongside the streams,
and they sing among the branches of the trees.
13 From ◄your home in heaven/the sky► you send rain down on the mountains,
and you fill the earth with many good things that you create.
14 You make/cause grass to grow for the cattle to eat,
and you make/cause plants to grow for people.
In that way animals and people get their food from what grows in the soil.
15 We get grapes to make [MTY] wine to drink and make us cheerful,
and we get olives to make [MTY] olive oil to put on our skin and cause it to shine,
and we get grain to make [MTY] bread to give us strength.
16 Yahweh, you send plenty of rain to water your trees,
the cedar trees that you planted in Lebanon.
17 Birds make their nests in those trees;
even storks make their nests in pine/fir trees.
18 High up in the mountains the wild goats live,
and hyraxes/badgers live in the crags/crevices in the rocks.
19 Yahweh, you made the moon to indicate the times for our festivals,
and you made the sun that knows when to go down.
20 You bring darkness, and it becomes night,
when all the animals in the forest prowl around, looking for food.
21 At night the young lions roar as they seek their prey,
but they depend on you to give them food.
PSALMS 104:22
881
PSALMS 105:3
22 At dawn, they go back to their dens and lie down.
23 And during the daytime, people go to their work;
they work until it is evening.
24 Yahweh, you have made so many different kinds of things!
You were very wise as you made them all.
The earth is full of the creatures that you made.
25 We see the ocean which is very large [DOU]!
It is full of many kinds of living creatures,
big ones and little ones.
26 We see the ships which sail along!
We see the huge sea monster, which you made to ◄splash around/play► in the
sea.
27 All of those creatures depend on you
to give them the food that they need.
28 When you give them the food that they need,
they gather it.
You give them what you have in your hand,
and they eat it and are satisfied.
29 But if you refuse to give food to them,
they become terrified.
And when you cause them to stop breathing, they die;
their bodies decay and become soil again.
30 When you cause newborn creatures to begin to breathe,
they start to live;
you give new life to all the living creatures on the earth.
31 I want the glory of Yahweh to last forever.
I want him to rejoice about all the things that he has created.
32 He causes the earth to shake just by looking at it!
By merely touching the mountains he makes/causes them to pour out fire and
smoke!
33 I will sing to Yahweh ◄as long as I live/throughout my entire life►.
I will praise my God until the day that I die.
34 I want Yahweh to be pleased by all those things that I have thought about him,
because I rejoice about knowing him.
35 But I desire that sinners will disappear from the earth,
so that there will be no more wicked people!
But as for me, I will praise Yahweh!
◄Praise him/Hallelujah►!
105
tell others about his wonderful miracles.
3 Be happy because you know that he [MTY] is holy!
PSALMS 105:4
882
PSALMS 105:24
You people who worship Yahweh, rejoice!
4 Ask Yahweh to help you and give you his strength,
and continue to ask him!
think about all the wonderful things that he has done:
He performed miracles, and he punished all our enemies.
7 He is Yahweh, our God.
He rules and judges people throughout the earth.
8 He never forgets the agreement that he made;
he made a promise that will last for 1,000 generations;
9 that is the agreement that he made with Abraham,
and he repeated that agreement with Isaac.
10 Later he confirmed it again to Jacob
as an agreement for the Israeli people that would last forever.
11 What he said was, “I will give you the Canaan region;
it will belong to you and your descendants forever.”
12 He said that to them when there were only a few of them,
a tiny group of people who were living in that land like strangers.
13 They continued to wander from one place to another,
from one kingdom to another.
14 But he did not allow others to oppress them.
He warned those kings by saying to them,
15 “Do not do harm the people whom I have chosen!
Do not harm my prophets!”
16 He sent a famine to Canaan, and as a result all the people had no food to eat.
17 So his people went to Egypt, but first he sent someone there.
He sent Joseph, who had been sold to be a slave.
18 Later, while Joseph was in prison in Egypt,
they put his legs in shackles that bruised his feet,
and they put an iron collar around his neck.
19 There, Yahweh ◄refined Joseph’s character/tested Joseph to see if Joseph would
continue to trust him►,
until what Joseph predicted would happen ◄came true/happened►.
20 The king of Egypt summoned him, and he set Joseph free;
this ruler of many people-groups released Joseph from prison.
21 Then he appointed him to take care of everything in the king’s household,
to take care of everything that the king possessed.
22 ◄Joseph was permitted/He permitted Joseph► to command the king’s servants
to do anything that Joseph wanted them to do,
and even to tell the king’s advisors the things that they should do for the people
of Egypt.
23 Later, Joseph’s father Jacob arrived in Egypt.
He lived like a foreigner in the land that belonged to the descendants of Ham.
24 And years later Yahweh caused the descendants of Jacob to become very numerous.
PSALMS 105:25
883
PSALMS 105:45
As a result, their enemies, the Egyptians, considered that the Israelis were too
strong.
25 So Yahweh caused the rulers of Egypt to ◄turn against/hate► the Israeli people,
and they planned ways to get rid of his people.
26 But then Yahweh sent his servant Moses
along with Moses’ older brother Aaron, whom Yahweh had also chosen to be his
servant.
27 Those two performed amazing miracles among the people of Egypt,
in that land where the descendants of Ham lived.
28 Yahweh sent darkness, so that the people of Egypt could not see anything [DOU],
but the rulers of Egypt refused [RHQ] to obey when Moses and Aaron commanded
them to let the Israeli people leave Egypt.
29 Yahweh caused all the water in Egypt to become ◄blood/red like blood►,
and his doing that caused all the fish to die.
30 Then he caused the land to become full of frogs;
the king and his officials even had frogs in their bedrooms.
31 Then Yahweh commanded that flies come, and swarms of them descended on the
people of Egypt,
and gnats also swarmed across the whole country.
32 Instead of sending rain, Yahweh sent terrible hail,
and lightning flashed throughout the land.
33 The hail ruined their grapevines and fig trees
and shattered all the other trees.
34 He commanded locusts to come, and swarms of them came;
so many that they could not be counted.
35 The locusts ate every green plant in the land,
ruining all the crops.
36 Then Yahweh killed the oldest son in every house of the people of Egypt [DOU].
37 Then he brought the Israeli people out from Egypt;
they were carrying loads of jewelry made of silver and gold that the women of
Egypt had given to them.
No one was left behind because of being sick.
38 The people of Egypt were glad when the Israeli people left,
because they had become very afraid of the Israelis.
and at night it became a big fire in the sky to give them light.
and Yahweh sent flocks of quail to them,
41 One day he caused a rock to open up and water poured out for them to drink;
42 He did that because he kept thinking about the sacred promise that he had given to
his servant, Abraham.
43 So his people were joyful as he brought them out from Egypt;
those people whom he had chosen were shouting joyfully as they went.
44 He gave to them the land that belonged to the people-groups that lived there in
Canaan,
and the Israelis harvested crops that other people had planted.
45 Yahweh did all these things
PSALMS 106:1
884
PSALMS 106:17
in order that his people would do all the things that he had commanded them to
do [DOU].
Praise Yahweh!
1 Praise Yahweh!
106
Praise Yahweh, because he does good things for us;
he faithfully loves us forever/continually!
2 Because Yahweh has done many great things,
no one can [RHQ] tell all the great things that Yahweh has done,
and no one can praise him enough/sufficiently.
3 ◄Happy are/He is pleased with► those who act fairly/justly,
with those who always do what is right.
4 Yahweh, be kind to me when you help your people;
help me when you rescue/save them.
5 Allow me to see it when your people become prosperous again
and when all the people of your nation, Israel, are happy;
allow me to be happy with them!
I want to praise you along with all those others who belong to you.
6 We and our ancestors have sinned;
we have done things that were very wicked [DOU].
7 When our ancestors were in Egypt,
they did not pay attention to the wonderful things that Yahweh did;
Instead, when they were at the Red Sea,
they rebelled against God, who is greater than any other god.
8 But he rescued them for the sake of his own reputation
9 He rebuked the Red Sea and it became dry,
and then while he led our ancestors across it,
they walked through it as though it were as dry as a desert [SIM].
10 In that way he rescued them from the power [MTY] of their enemies who hated
them [DOU].
11 Then their enemies were drowned in the water of the Red Sea;
not one of them was left.
what he had promised to do,
and they sang to praise him.
13 But they soon forgot what he had done for them;
they did things without waiting to find out what Yahweh wanted them to do.
14 They intensely wanted food like they formerly ate in Egypt.
They did evil things to find out if they could do those things without God punishing
them.
15 So he gave them what they requested,
but he also caused a terrible disease to afflict them.
16 Later when some of the men became jealous of Moses
and his older brother Aaron, who was dedicated to serve Yahweh by being a priest,
PSALMS 106:18
885
PSALMS 106:37
and also buried Abiram and his family.
18 And God sent a fire down from heaven
which burned up all the wicked people who ◄supported them/agreed with► them.
19 Then the Israeli leaders made a gold statue at Sinai Mountain
and worshiped it.
20 Instead of worshiping our glorious God,
they started to worship a statue of a bull that eats grass!
forgot about God, who had rescued them by the great miracles that he
performed in Egypt.
and the amazing/awesome things that he did for them at the Red Sea.
but Moses, whom God had chosen to serve him, pleaded with God not to get rid
And as a result God did not destroy them.
because they did not believe that God would enable them to take the land from
the people who were living there, as he had promised.
25 They stayed in their tents and grumbled
and would not pay attention to what Yahweh said that they should do.
26 So he solemnly [MTY] told them
that he would cause them to die there in the desert,
27 and that he would scatter their descendants among the people of other nations/
people-groups who did not believe in him,
and that he would allow them to die in those lands.
28 Later the Israeli people started to worship the idol of Baal who they thought lived
at Peor Mountain,
and they ate meat that had been sacrificed to Baal and those other lifeless gods.
29 Yahweh became very angry because of what they had done,
so again he sent a terrible disease to attack/strike them.
30 But Phinehas stood up and punished/killed the ones who had sinned greatly,
and as a result the ◄plague/serious disease► ended.
31 People have remembered that righteous thing that Phinehas did,
and in future years people will remember it.
32 Then at Meribah Springs our ancestors caused Yahweh to become angry,
and as a result Moses had trouble.
33 They caused Moses to become very angry [IDM],
and he said things that were foolish.
34 Our ancestors did not destroy the people who did not believe in Yahweh
like he told them to do.
35 Instead, they mingled with people from those people-groups,
and they started to do the evil things that those people did.
36 Our ancestors worshiped the idols of those people,
which resulted in their being destroyed/exiled/taken to another country [MET].
37 Some of the Israelis sacrificed their sons and daughters to the demons that those
idols represented.
PSALMS 106:38
886
PSALMS 107:5
38 They killed [MTY] their own children, who ◄were innocent/had not done things
that were wrong►,
and offered them as sacrifices to the idols in Canaan.
As a result, Canaan land was polluted by those murders [MTY].
39 So by their deeds they caused themselves to become unacceptable to God;
because they did not faithfully worship only God,
they became like women who sleep with other men instead of sleeping only with
their husbands [MET].
40 So Yahweh became very angry with his people;
he was completely disgusted with them.
41 As a result he allowed people-groups who did not believe in him to conquer them,
so those who hated our ancestors started to rule over them.
42 Their enemies ◄oppressed them/treated them cruelly►
and completely controlled them [MET].
43 Many times Yahweh rescued them,
but they continued to rebel against him,
and they were finally destroyed because of the sins that they committed.
44 However, Yahweh always heard them when they cried out to him;
he listened to them when they were distressed.
45 For their sake, he thought about the agreement/promise that he had made to bless
them,
he changed his mind about punishing them more.
46 He caused all those who had taken the Israelis to Babylonia to ◄feel sorry for/pity►
them.
47 Yahweh our God, rescue/save us
and bring us back to Israel from among those people-groups
in order that we may thank you [MTY]
and joyfully praise you.
48 Praise Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship,
praise him now and forever!
And I want everyone to say, “Amen/May it be so!”
Praise Yahweh!
Book Five
107
1 Give thanks to Yahweh, because he always does good things for us
His faithful love for us lasts forever!
2 Those whom Yahweh has saved should tell others
that he has rescued them from their enemies.
3 He has gathered those of you who were ◄exiled/taken forcefully► to many lands;
he has gathered you together from the east and the west,
from the north and from the south.
4 Some of those who returned from those countries wandered in the desert;
they were lost and had no homes to live in.
5 They were hungry and thirsty,
PSALMS 107:6
887
PSALMS 107:27
and they were very discouraged.
6 When they were in trouble, they called out to Yahweh,
and he rescued them from ◄being distressed/their difficulties►.
7 He led them along a straight road where they walked safely
to cities in Canaan where they could live.
8 They should praise/thank Yahweh for loving them faithfully
and for the wonderful things that he does for people.
9 He gives thirsty people plenty of water to drink,
and he gives hungry people plenty of good things to eat.
10 Some of them were in very dark [HEN] ◄places in Babylonia/other countries►;
they were prisoners, suffering because of chains fastened to their hands and feet.
11 They were in prison because they had ◄rebelled against/not obeyed► the message
of God;
they were there because they had despised the advice given by God,
who is greater than all other gods.
12 That is why their bodies were worn out from hard labor;
when they fell down, there was no one who would help them.
13 In their troubles, they called out to Yahweh,
and he rescued them from their being distressed.
14 He broke the chains that were on their hands and feet;
and brought them out of those very dark prisons.
15-16 He broke down the prison gates that were made of bronze,
and cut through the prison bars that were made of iron.
So they also should praise/thank Yahweh for faithfully loving them,
and for all the wonderful things that he does for people.
17 Some of them foolishly rebelled against God,
so they suffered for their sins.
18 They did not want to eat any food,
and they almost died.
19 In their troubles, they also called out to Yahweh,
and he rescued them from their being distressed.
20 When he commanded that they be healed, they were healed;
21 They also should praise/thank Yahweh for faithfully loving them,
and for all the wonderful things that he does for people.
22 They should give offerings to him to show that they are thankful,
the wonderful things that he did when they were on very deep seas.
25 He commanded the winds, and they became strong
and ◄stirred up high waves/caused waves to rise high►.
26 The ships in which they were sailing were tossed high in the air,
and then they sank into the ◄troughs/low places► between the high waves;
then the sailors were terrified.
27 They stumbled about and staggered like drunken men,
PSALMS 107:28
888
PSALMS 108:3
and they did not know what to do.
28 In their troubles, they also called out to Yahweh,
and he rescued them from their distresses.
29 He ◄calmed the storm/caused the wind to stop blowing►,
and he caused the waves to completely subside.
30 They were very glad when it became calm;
and Yahweh brought them safely into a harbor.
31 They also should praise/thank Yahweh for faithfully loving them,
and for all the wonderful things that he does for people.
32 They should praise him among the Israeli people when they have gathered together,
and they should praise him in front of the leaders of the country.
33 Sometimes Yahweh causes rivers to become dry,
with the result that the land becomes a desert,
and springs of water become dry land.
34 Sometimes he causes land that has produced lots of crops to become salty
wastelands,
with the result that they do not produce crops.
He does that because the people who live there are very wicked.
35 But sometimes he causes pools of water to appear in deserts,
and he causes springs to flow in very dry ground.
36 He brings hungry people into that land, to live there and build cities there.
37 They plant seeds in their fields,
and they plant grapevines that produce big crops of grapes.
38 He blesses the people, and the women give birth to many children,
and they have large herds of cattle.
39 When the number of people becomes smaller and they have been humiliated by
their enemies
by being oppressed and caused to suffer [DOU],
40 Yahweh shows contempt for the leaders who oppress them,
and causes them to wander in deserts where there are no roads.
41 But he rescues poor people from ◄being in misery/suffering►,
and causes their families to increase in number like flocks of sheep.
42 Godly/Righteous people will ◄see/hear about► these things, and they will rejoice,
and wicked people will hear about these things, too,
but they will have nothing to say in reply.
43 Those who are wise should think carefully about those things;
they should consider all the things that Yahweh has done to show that he faithfully
loves them.
A psalm written by David
with all my inner being.
2 I will arise before the sun rises,
and I will praise you while I play my big harp and my ◄lyre/small harp►.
3 I prayed, “Yahweh, I will thank you among all the people-groups;
I will sing to praise you among the nations,
PSALMS 108:4
889
PSALMS 109:7
4 because your faithful love for us reaches up to the heavens,
and your faithfully doing what you promise is as great as the distance up to the
clouds.
5 Yahweh, show in the heavens that you are very great!
And show your glory to people all over the earth!
6 Answer our prayers and by your power help us [MTY] to defeat our enemies
in order that we, the people whom you love, may be saved/rescued.”
7 And Yahweh answered our prayers and spoke from his temple, saying, “Because I
have conquered your enemies, I will joyfully divideeverything in Shechem city
and I will distribute among my people the valuable things in Succoth Valley.
8 The Gilead region is mine;
the people of the tribe of Manasseh are mine;
the tribe of Ephraim is like my war helmet,
and the tribe of Judah is like the ◄scepter/stick that I hold which shows that I am
the ruler► [MET];
9 the Moab region is like my washbasin [MET];
I throw my sandal in the Edom area to show that it belongs to me;
I shout triumphantly because I have defeated the people of the Philistia area.”
10 Because we want to attack the people of Edom,
◄who will lead my army triumphantly to their capital city that has strong walls around
it?/I want someone to lead my army triumphantly to their capital city that has
strong walls around it.► [RHQ]
11 God, we hope that [RHQ] you have not abandoned us,
and that you will go with us when our army marches out to fight our enemies.
12 We need you to help us when we fight against our enemies,
because the help that humans can give us is worthless.
13 But with you helping us, we shall win;
you will enable us to defeat our enemies.
109
A psalm written by David for the choir director
1 God, you are the one whom I praise,
2 because wicked people slander me
3 They are constantly saying that they hate me,
4 I show them that I want to be their friends
and I pray for them,
5 In return for my doing good things for them and loving them,
6 They said, “Appoint a wicked judge who will judge him,
and bring in one of his enemies who will stand up and accuse him.
7 And cause that when the trial ends,
the judge will declare that he is guilty,
and that even his prayer will be considered to be a sin.
PSALMS 109:8
890
PSALMS 109:26
8 Then, cause that he will soon die
and that someone else will have his job/work (OR, possessions).
9 Cause that his children will not have a father any more
and that his wife will become a widow.
10 Cause that his children will be forced to leave the ruined homes that they have
been living in
and wander around begging for food.
11 Cause that all the people to whom he owed money will seize all his property;
Cause that strangers will take away everything that he worked to acquire.
12 Cause that while he is still living no one will be kind to him,
and after he dies, cause that no one will pity his children.
13 Cause that all his descendants will die
and that his grandchildren will not remember who he [MTY] was.
14 Yahweh, remember and do not forgive his ancestors for the evil things that they
did,
and do not even forgive the sins that his mother committed;
15 think about his sins continually,
and cause that his name will be completely forgotten.
16 He never was kind to anyone;
he ◄persecuted/cause problems for► poor and needy people
and even killed helpless people.
17 He liked to curse people.
So cause those terrible things that he requested to happen to others to happen to
him!
He did not want to bless others,
so cause that no one will bless him!
18 He cursed other people as often/easily as he put on his clothes [SIM];
cause that the terrible things that he wanted to happen to others will happen to
him and enter his body like water that he drinks [SIM],
19 Cause that those terrible things will cling to him like his clothes
20 Yahweh, I want you to punish all my enemies that way,
21 But Yahweh, my God, do good things for me
in order that I may honor you;
rescue me from my enemies
because your faithfully loving me is good.
22 I ask you to do this because I am poor and needy
and my inner being is ◄full of pain/very troubled/discouraged►.
23 I think that my time to remain alive is short,
like an evening shadow that will soon disappear [SIM].
I will be blown away like a locust/grasshopper is blown by the wind.
24 My knees are weak because I have ◄fasted/abstained from eating food► very often,
and my body has become very thin.
25 The people who accuse me make fun of me;
when they see me, they insult me by shaking their heads at me as though I were
an evil man.
26 Yahweh, my God, help me!
PSALMS 109:27
891
PSALMS 111:1
Because you faithfully love me, rescue me!
27 When you save me,
cause my enemies to know that you are the one who has done it!
28 They may curse me, but I ask that you bless me.
Cause those who ◄persecute/cause problems for► me to be defeated and as a
result to be disgraced/ashamed,
and cause me to be glad/happy!
29 Cause those who accuse me to be completely disgraced;
cause other people to see that they are disgraced, as easily as they see the clothes
that they wear [SIM]!
30 But I will thank Yahweh very greatly;
I will praise him when I am among the crowd of people who are worshiping him.
31 I will do that because he defends [MTY] needy people like me,
and saves us from those who have decided/declared that we must be executed.
110
A psalm written by David
1 Yahweh said to my lord the king,
“Sit here, close to me, in the place of highest honor [MTY]
until I completely defeat your enemies [MET]
and make them like a stool for your feet!”
2 Yahweh also said to him, “I will extend your power as king
from Jerusalem to other lands;
you will rule over all your enemies.
3 On the day that you lead your armies into battle,
many of your people will volunteer to join your army.
Like the dew refreshes the earth early in the morning,
4 Yahweh has made a solemn promise,
and he will never change his mind;
serving Yahweh like Melchizedek did.”
when he becomes angry, he will defeat many kings.
6 He will judge and punish the people of many nations;
he will fill the land with their corpses.
He will crush the heads of other kings all over the earth.
7 But my lord the king will drink from streams near the road;
he will be refreshed after defeating his enemies.
1 Praise Yahweh!
111
I will thank Yahweh with my entire inner being,
every time I am with a large group of godly/righteous people.
PSALMS 111:2
892
PSALMS 112:9
2 The things that Yahweh has done are wonderful!
All those who are delighted/pleased with those things
desire to ◄study/think about► them.
3 Because of everything that he does,
people greatly honor him and respect him because he is a great king;
the righteous/just things that he does will endure forever.
4 He has appointed/established festivals in which we remember the wonderful things
that he has done;
Yahweh always is kind and merciful.
5 He provides food for those who revere him;
he never forgets the agreement that he made with our ancestors.
6 By enabling his people to capture the lands that belonged to other people-groups,
he has shown to us, his people, that he is very powerful.
7 He [MTY] faithfully does what he has promised and always does what is just/fair,
and we can depend on him to help us when he commands us to do things.
8 What he commands must be obeyed forever;
and he acted in a true and righteous manner when he gave us those commands.
9 He rescued us, his people, from being slaves in Egypt,
and he made an agreement with us that will last forever.
He [MTY] is holy and awesome!
10 Revering Yahweh is the way to become wise.
All those who obey his commands will know what is good for them to decide to
do.
We should praise him forever!
1 Praise Yahweh!
112
◄Happy are/He is pleased with► those who revere him,
those who happily obey his commands.
2 Their children will prosper in their land;
and their descendants will be blessed by God.
3 Their families [MTY] will be very wealthy [DOU],
and the results of their righteous deeds will endure forever.
4 Godly/Righteous people are like lights [SIM] that shine in the darkness
on those who are kind, merciful and righteous.
5 Things will go well for those who generously lend money to others
and who conduct their businesses honestly.
6 Righteous people will not be overwhelmed/ worried/ distressed because of their
troubles,
and they will never be forgotten by other people.
7 They are not afraid of receiving bad news;
they confidently/completely trust in Yahweh.
8 They are confident and not afraid,
because they know that they will see God defeat their enemies.
9 They give things generously to poor/needy people;
the results of their kind deeds will endure forever,
PSALMS 114:7
10 Wicked people see those things and are angry;
but they will disappear and die.
1 Praise Yahweh!
113
You people who serve Yahweh, praise him!
Praise ◄him/his name►!
2 Yahweh should be praised now and forever!
3 People who live in the east and people who live in the west,
everyone, should praise Yahweh [MTY]!
4 Yahweh rules [MTY] over all the nations,
and high in the heavens he shows that his glory is very great.
5 There is no one [RHQ] who is like Yahweh, our God,
who lives/sits/rules in the highest heaven,
6 and looks far down through the heavens and sees the people on the earth.
7 Sometimes he lifts poor people up so that they no longer sit in the dirt;
he helps needy people so that they no longer sit on heaps of ashes
8 and causes them to be honored by sitting next to princes,
the sons of the kings who rule their people.
9 He also enables women who have no children to have a family;
he causes them to be happy mothers.
Praise Yahweh!
1 When the Israeli people left Egypt,
114
when they who were descendants of Jacob left people who spoke a foreign/different
language,
2 the land of Judah became the place where people worshiped God;
and Israel became the land (OR, the Israeli people became the people) that he
ruled over.
3 When they came to the Red
Sea,
it was as though the water saw them and ran away!
When they came to the Jordan River,
that water in the river stopped flowing so that the Israelis could cross it.
4 When they came to Sinai Mountain and there was a big earthquake,
it was as though the mountains skipped/jumped like goats do
and the hills jumped around like lambs do.
5 If someone asks, “What happened at the Red Sea that caused the water to run away?
What happened that caused the water in the Jordan River to stop flowing?
6 What happened that caused the mountains to skip like goats
and caused the hills to jump around like lambs?”
7 I would reply that it was the presence of the Lord that caused those things to happen!
PSALMS 114:8
894
PSALMS 115:17
Everyone/ Everything on the earth should tremble in the presence of God, whom
◄Jacob worshiped/the Israeli people worship►!
8 He is the one who caused pools of water for the Israeli people to drink to flow from
a rock;
he caused a spring to flow from a solid rock cliff!
115
1 Yahweh, people should praise only you [MTY];
they must praise you, not us,
because you faithfully love us and always do what you have promised to do.
2 It is not right that [RHQ] other people-groups should say about us,
“They claim that their God is very powerful,
but if that is true, why does he not help them?”
3 Our God is in heaven,
and he does whatever he wants to!
4 But their idols are only statues made of silver and gold,
things that humans have made.
5 Their idols have mouths, but they cannot say anything;
they have eyes, but they cannot see anything.
6 They have ears, but they cannot hear anything;
they have noses, but they cannot smell anything.
7 They have hands, but they cannot feel anything;
they have feet, but they cannot walk,
and they have throats but cannot even make any sounds!
8 The people who make those idols are as powerless as those idols,
and those who trust in those idols can accomplish nothing, just like their idols!
9 You, my fellow Israeli people, trust in Yahweh!
He is the one who helps you and protects you like [MET] a shield.
10 You priests [MTY], trust in Yahweh!
He is the one who helps you and protects you like [MET] a shield.
11 All you who revere Yahweh, trust in him!
He will bless the priests,
he will bless important people and people who are considered to be unimportant,
everyone!
14 I desire that Yahweh will give many children
to you my fellow-Israeli people, and to your descendants.
15 I desire that Yahweh, the one who made heaven and the earth, will bless all of you!
16 The highest heavens belong to Yahweh,
but he gave everything that is on the earth to us people.
17 Dead people are not able to praise Yahweh;
when they descend into the place where dead people are,
they are unable to speak and cannot praise him.
PSALMS 115:18
895
PSALMS 116:18-19
18 But we who are alive will thank/praise him,
now and forever.
Praise Yahweh!
1 I love Yahweh,
116
because he hears me when I cry for him to help me.
2 He listens to me,
so I will call out to him all during my life.
3 Everything around me [MET] caused me to think that I would die;
I was very afraid that I would die and go to the place where dead people are.
I was very distressed/worried and afraid.
4 But then I called out to Yahweh, saying,
“Yahweh, I plead with you to save/rescue me!”
5 Yahweh is kind and does what is right;
he is our God, and he acts mercifully to us.
6 He protects those who ◄are helpless/cannot defend themselves►;
and when I thought that I would die, he saved me.
and has kept/protected me from troubles that would cause me to cry.
He has kept/protected me from stumbling.
9 So here on the earth, where people are still alive,
I live knowing that Yahweh is directing me.
10 I continued to believe/trust in Yahweh,
even when I said, “I am greatly afflicted/troubled.”
11 Even when I was distressed/worried and said, “I cannot trust anyone,”
I continued to trust in Yahweh.
12 So now I will tell you [RHQ] what I will offer to Yahweh,
because of all the good things that he has done for me.
13 I will offer to him a cup of wine
to thank him for saving/rescuing me.
14 When I am together with many [HYP] people who belong to Yahweh,
I will give to him the offerings that I solemnly promised to give to him.
15 Yahweh is very grieved/sad when one of his people dies.
16 I am one of those who serve Yahweh;
I serve him like my mother did.
He has freed/saved me from dying (OR, from being fastened by chains).
17 So I will offer to him a sacrifice to thank him,
and I will pray to him.
18-19 When I am together with many of [HYP] the people who belong to Yahweh,
in the courtyard outside his temple in Jerusalem,
PSALMS 117:1
896
PSALMS 118:14
I will give to him the offerings that I solemnly promised to give to him.
Praise Yahweh!
117
1 You people of all nations, praise Yahweh!
All you people-groups, extol/praise him,
2 because he faithfully loves us very much.
and he will forever faithfully do for us what he promised that he would do.
Praise Yahweh!
118
1 Tell Yahweh that you thank him very much for the good things that he has done for
you
He faithfully loves us, his people, forever.
2 You Israeli people should repeatedly shout,
“He faithfully loves us, his people, forever!”
3 You priests who are descendants of Aaron should repeatedly shout,
“He faithfully loves us, his people, forever!”
4 All you who revere him should repeatedly shout,
“He faithfully loves us, his people, forever!”
5 When I was distressed, I called out to Yahweh,
and he answered me and set me free from my worries/troubles.
6 Yahweh is ◄on my side/helping me►,
so I will not be afraid of anything.
No one [RHQ] can do anything that will prevent God from blessing me forever.
7 Yes, Yahweh is ◄on my side/helping me►,
so I will look triumphantly at my enemies while he defeats them.
8 It is better to trust in Yahweh
than to ◄depend on/trust in► people.
9 It is better to trust Yahweh to protect us
than to trust that influential/important people will protect us.
10 Armies of [MTY] many nations surrounded me,
but Yahweh enabled me to defeat them by his power [MTY].
11 They completely surrounded me,
but I defeated them all by the power of Yahweh.
12 They swarmed around me like angry bees;
they were like a fire that blazes strongly, but only briefly, in a thornbush,
but I defeated them by the power [MTY] that Yahweh gave me.
13 My enemies attacked me fiercely and almost defeated me,
but Yahweh helped me.
14 Yahweh is the one who makes me strong,
and he is the one about whom I always sing;
PSALMS 118:15
897
PSALMS 119:4
15 Listen to the joyful songs of victory being sung in the tents of godly/righteous people!
They sing, “Yahweh has defeated our enemies by his mighty power [MTY];
16 he has raised his strong right arm to show he has defeated his enemies.
Yahweh has completely defeated them!”
17 I will not be killed in battle;
I will live to proclaim the great things that Yahweh has done.
18 Yahweh has punished me severely,
but he has not allowed ◄me to die/my enemies to kill me►.
19 You gatekeepers, open for me the gates of the temple
in order that I may enter and thank Yahweh.
20 Those are the gates through which we enter the temple to worship Yahweh;
godly/righteous people enter those gates.
21 Yahweh, I thank you that you answered my prayer,
and you saved me from my enemies.
22 Yahweh’s promised/chosen king is like [MET] the stone which the builders rejected
when they were building a house,
but that stone became the ◄cornerstone/most important stone in the building►.
23 ◄This was done by Yahweh/Yahweh has done this►,
and it is a wonderful thing for us to see.
24 This is the day in which we remember that Yahweh acted powerfully to defeat our
enemies;
we will rejoice and be glad/happy today.
25 Yahweh, we plead with you to keep rescuing us from our enemies.
Yahweh, please help us ◄accomplish/do well► what we want to do.
26 Yahweh, bless the one who will come with your authority [MTY].
And from the temple we ◄bless/ask Yahweh to bless► all of you.
27 Yahweh is God,
and he has caused his light to shine on us.
they go to the altar.
29 Thank Yahweh, because he does good things for us
He will faithfully love us forever.
119
1 ◄Yahweh is pleased with/Happy are► those about whom no one can say truthfully
that they have done things that are wrong,
those who always obey the laws of Yahweh.
2 Yahweh is pleased with those who ◄obey his requirements/do what he has instructed
them to do►,
3 They do not do things that are wrong;
4 Yahweh, you have given us ◄your principles of behavior/all the things that you have
declared that we should do►,
PSALMS 119:5
898
PSALMS 119:26
and you told us to obey them carefully.

13 I [MTY] tell others ◄the regulations/the rules that you have given to us►.
14 I like to obey ◄your requirements/what you have instructed us to do►;

us to do► during all my life.

19 I am living here on the earth for only a short time;
◄do not prevent me from understanding/help me to understand► [LIT] ◄your
commands/what you have commanded►.
20 In my inner being I strongly desire to know ◄your regulations/the rules that you
have given to us► all the time.
21 You rebuke those who are proud;
cursed are those who disobey ◄your commands/what you have commanded►.
22 Do not allow them to continue to insult and scorn me;
I request this because I have obeyed what you have instructed us to do.
23 Rulers gather together and plan ways to harm me,
but I will ◄meditate on/study► ◄your statutes/what you have decreed►.
24 I am delighted with ◄your requirements/what you have instructed us to do►;
it is as though they are my advisors.
6 If
25 I think that I will soon die [IDM];
revive/heal me, as you have told me that you would.
26 When I told you about my behavior, you answered me;
teach me ◄your statutes/what you have decreed that we should do►.
PSALMS 119:27
899
PSALMS 119:46
27 Help me to understand ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared that
we should do►,
and then I will ◄meditate on/think about► the wonderful things that you have
done.
28 I am very sad/sorrowful [IDM], with the result that I have no strength;
enable me to be strong again, like you promised me that you would do.
29 Prevent me from doing what is wrong,
and be kind to me by teaching me your laws.
30 I have decided that I will faithfully/always obey you;
I have ◄paid attention to/heeded► ◄your regulations/the rules that you have

so ◄lead me along the paths/enable me to walk on the road► that you have chosen
for me.
36 Cause me to want to obey your rules
and not to want to become rich.
37 Do not allow me to look at things that are worthless,
and allow me to continue to live, like you promised that you would do.
38 Because I serve you, do what you promised to do for me,
which is what you also promise to do for all those who revere you.
39 People insult me;
protect me from those insults, because I hate them.
The ◄regulations/rules that you have given to us► are very good!
40 I very much desire to obey ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared
that we should do►;
because you are righteous, allow me to continue to live (OR, be good to me).
41 Yahweh, show me that you faithfully love me,

47 I am delighted to obey ◄your commands/what you have commanded►,
and I love them.
48 I respect/revere [IDM] ◄your commands/what you have commanded►,
and I love them,
we should do►.
49 Do not forget what you said/promised to do for me, who serve you,
because what you have said has caused me to confidently expect good things from
you.
50 When I have been suffering, you comforted me;
you did what you promised me, and that [PRS] revived me.
51 Proud people are always making fun of me,
but I do not ◄turn away from/stop► obeying your laws.
52 Yahweh, when I think about ◄your regulations/the rules► that you gave to us long
ago,
I am comforted/encouraged.
53 When I see that wicked people have disregarded your laws,
I become very angry.
54 While I have been living here for a short time on the earth,
I have written songs about ◄your statutes/what you have decreed that we should
do►.
55 Yahweh, during the night I think about you [MTY],
and so I obey your laws.
56 What I have always done is to obey ◄your principles of behavior/what you have
57 Yahweh, you are the one whom I have chosen,
and I promise to ◄obey your words/do what you have told us to do►.

59 I have thought about my behavior,
and I have decided to return to obeying ◄your requirements/ what you have
instructed us to do►.
60 I hurry to obey ◄your commands/what you have commanded►;
I do not delay at all.
61 Wicked people have tried to seize me, like a hunter tries to catch an animal with a
net [MET],
but I do not forget your laws.
62 In the middle of the night I wake up,
and I praise you for ◄your commands/the rules that you have given us to do►;
they are fair/just.
63 I am a friend of all those who revere you,
those who obey ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared that we
should do►.
64 Yahweh, you faithfully/always love people all over the earth;
teach me ◄your statutes/what you have decreed that we should do►.
65 Yahweh, you have done good things for me,
like you promised/said that you would do.
66 Teach me to think carefully before I decide what to do,
and teach me other things that I need to know,
PSALMS 119:67
901
PSALMS 119:84
because I believe that it is good for us to obey ◄your commands/what you have
commanded►.
67 Before you afflicted/punished me, I did things that were wrong,
but now I obey ◄your words/what you have told us to do►.
68 You are very good, and what you do is good;
teach me ◄your statutes/what you have decreed that we should do►.
69 Proud people have told many lies about me,
but the truth is that with all my inner being I obey ◄your principles of behavior/
what you have declared that we should do►.
70 Those proud people ◄are stupid/do not understand your laws► [IDM],
but as for me, I am delighted with your laws.
because the result was that I learned ◄your statutes/what you have decreed that
72 The laws that you [MTY] gave/told to us are worth more to me than gold,
more than thousands of pieces of gold and silver.
73 You created me and formed my body (OR, kept me safe);
help me to be wise in order that I may learn ◄your commands/what you have
commanded►.
74 Those who have an awesome respect for you will see what you have done for me,
and they will rejoice,
because they will see that I have trusted in ◄your words/what you told us►.
75 Yahweh, I know that ◄your regulations/the rules that you have given to us► are
right/fair
and that you have afflicted/punished me because you faithfully do what you have
promised.
76 Cause me to be comforted/encouraged by knowing that you faithfully love me,
like you said to me that you would do.
77 Be merciful to me in order that I may continue to live,
because I am delighted with your laws.
78 Cause the proud people who falsely accuse me to be ashamed,
but as for me, I will continue ◄meditating on/thinking about► ◄your principles
of behavior/what you have declared that we should do►.
79 Cause those who revere you to come back to me
in order that they may (OR, specifically, those who) know ◄your requirements/
what you have instructed us to do►.
80 Enable me to perfectly obey ◄your statutes/what you have decreed that we should
do►
in order that I may not be ashamed because of not doing that.
81 I am very tired/exhausted while I wait for you to save me from my enemies;
but I confidently expect that you will tell me what you will do.
82 My eyes are tired from waiting a long time for you to do what you promised/said
that you would do,
and I ask, “When will you help/encourage me?”
83 I have become as useless as [MET] a wineskin that is shriveled from hanging a long
time in the smoke inside a house,
but I have not forgotten ◄your statutes/what you have decreed that we should
do►.
84 How long must I wait?
PSALMS 119:85
902
PSALMS 119:103
When will you punish those who ◄persecute/cause trouble for► me?
85 It is as though proud people have dug deep pits for me to fall into,
people who do not obey your laws.
86 All ◄your commands are/what you have commanded is► trustworthy;
but people are ◄persecuting/causing trouble for► me by telling lies about me, so
87 Those people have almost killed me,
but I have not stopped obeying ◄your principles of behavior/what you have
declared that we should do►.
88 Because you faithfully love me, allow me to continue to live
in order that I may continue to obey ◄your rules/what you have instructed us to
do►.
89 Yahweh, your words will last forever;
they will last as long as heaven lasts.
will faithfully continue doing ◄for people who are not yet born/ in every
generation► what you have ◄promised/said that you would do►;
you have put the earth in its place, and it remains firmly there.
91 To this day, all things on the earth remain because you decided that they should
remain;
everything on the earth serves you.
92 If I had not been delighted in obeying your laws,
I would have died because of what I was suffering.
93 I will never forget ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared that we
should do►,
because as a result of my obeying them you have enabled me to continue to live.
94 I belong to you; save/rescue me from my enemies,
because I have tried to obey ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared
that we should do►.
95 Wicked men are waiting to kill me,
but I will think about what you have instructed us to do.
96 I have learned that there is a limit/end for everything,
but what you command ◄has no limits/never ends►.
90 You
97 I love your laws very much.
I ◄meditate on/think about► them all during the day.
98 Because I know ◄your commands/what you have commanded►,
and because I think about them all the time,
I have become wiser than my enemies.
99 I understand more than my teachers do,
because I ◄meditate on/ think about► ◄your requirements/ what you have
instructed us to do►.
100 I understand more than many old people do,
because I obey ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared that we
should do►.
101 I have avoided all evil behavior
in order that I may obey ◄your words/what you have told us to do►.
102 I have not ◄turned away from/quit► obeying ◄your regulations/the rules that you
have given to us►,
103 When I read your words,
PSALMS 119:104
903
PSALMS 119:120
they are like [MET] sweet things that I taste/eat,
yes, they are even sweeter than honey.
104 Because I have learned ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared that
we should do►,
I am able to understand many things;
therefore, I hate all evil things that some people do.
105 Your words are like [MET] a lamp to guide me;
they are like a light [MET] to show me the path that I should walk on.
106 I have solemnly promised, and I am solemnly promising it again,
that I will always obey your ◄regulations/rules that you have given to us►,
and they are all fair/just.
107 Yahweh, I am suffering very much;
cause me to be strong/healthy again, as you have promised to do.
108 Yahweh, when I thank you while I pray, it is like [MET] a sacrifice to you;
please accept it,
and teach me your ◄regulations/rules that you have given to us►.
109 My enemies are often trying to kill me [IDM],
but I do not forget your laws.
110 Wicked people have tried to seize me like a hunter tries to catch an animal with a
trap [MET],
but I have not disobeyed ◄your principles of behavior/what you declared that
we should do►.
111 ◄Your requirements/ What you have instructed us to do► are my possession
forever;
because of them [PRS], I am joyful.
112 I ◄have decided/am determined► [IDM] to obey ◄your statutes/what you have
decreed that we should do► until the day that I die [MTY].
113 I hate people who are only partly committed to you,
but I love your laws.
114 You are like a place where I can hide from my enemies,
and you are like a shield [MET] behind which I am protected from them,
and I trust in your promises.
115 You evil people, stay away from me
in order than I may obey ◄my God’s commands/what my God has commanded►!
116 Enable me to be strong, as you promised/said that you would do,
in order that I may continue to live.
I am confidently expecting that you will restore me;
◄do not disappoint me/do not allow me to be disappointed►.
117 Hold me up, in order that I will be safe
and always ◄pay attention to/heed► ◄your statutes/what you have decreed that
118 You reject all those who disobey ◄your statutes/what you have decreed that we
but what they deceitfully plan to do will be ◄useless/in vain►.
therefore I love what you have instructed us to do.
I am afraid because you punish those who do not obey ◄your regulations/the rules
that you have given to us►.
PSALMS 119:121
904
PSALMS 119:141
121 But I have done what is right and fair/just;
so do not allow people to oppress/mistreat me.
122 Promise me that you will do good things for me
and do not allow proud people to oppress me.
123 My eyes are tired from waiting a long time for you to rescue me,
for you to save me like you promised/said that you would.
124 Do something for me to show that you faithfully love me,
and teach me ◄your statutes/what you have decreed that we should do►.
125 I am one who serves you;
enable me to understand what you want me to know
in order that I will know ◄your requirements/what you have instructed us to
do►.
126 Yahweh, now is the time for you to punish people
because they have disobeyed your laws.
127 Truly, I love ◄your commands/what you have commanded► more than I love gold;
I love them more than I love very pure gold.
128 So I conduct my life by ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared that
we should do►,
and I hate all the evil things that some people do.
129 ◄Your requirements are/All the things that you have instructed us to do are►
wonderful,
so I obey them with all my inner being.
130 When someone explains ◄your words/what you have said►,
it is as though they are lighting a light;
what they say causes even people who have not learned your laws to be wise.
131 I eagerly desire to know ◄your commands/what you have commanded►,
like [SIM] a dog that pants with its mouth open wanting to be fed.
132 Listen to me and act kindly to me,
like you do to all those who love you [MTY].
133 Guide me as you promised/said that you would do and help me not to fall/sin;
do not allow evil people to control what I do.
134 Rescue/Save me from those who oppress me
in order that I may obey ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared
135 Be kind to me
136 I cry very much
137 Yahweh, you are righteous
and ◄your regulations/the rules that you have given to us► are just/fair.
138 ◄Your requirements/All the things that you have instructed us to do► are true
and are all very right and fair.
139 I am ◄furious/very angry►
because my enemies disregard ◄your words/what you have told us to do►.
promises are/ All the things that you have said that you will do are►
dependable
and I love them.
141 I am not important and people despise me,
140 ◄Your
PSALMS 119:142

but I do not forget ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared that we
should do►.
142 You are righteous and you will be righteous forever,
and your laws will never be changed.
143 I constantly have troubles/difficulties and I am worried,
but ◄your commands cause/what you have commanded causes► me to be happy.
144 ◄Your requirements are/All the things that you have instructed us to do are►
always fair;
help me to understand them in order that I may continue to live.
145 Yahweh, with all my inner being I call out to you;
answer me and I will obey ◄your statutes/what you have decreed that we should
do►.
146 I call out to you;
save/rescue me in order that I can continue to obey all ◄your requirements/the
things that you have instructed us to do►.
147 Each morning I arise before dawn and call to you to help me;
I confidently expect you to do what you have ◄promised/said that you will do►.
148 All during the night I am awake,
and I ◄meditate on/think about► what you have ◄promised/said that you would
do►.
149 Yahweh, because you faithfully love me,
listen to me while I pray,
and keep me safe because of my obeying ◄your regulations/what you have told
us to do►.
150 Those evil people who oppress/persecute me are coming closer to me;
they do not pay any attention to your laws.
151 But Yahweh, you are near to me,
and I know that ◄your commands/what you command► will never be changed.
152 Long ago I found out about ◄your requirements/all the things that you have
and I know that you intended them to last forever.
because I do not forget your laws.
154 Defend me when others accuse me, and rescue me from them;
allow me to continue to live, as you promised/said that you would.
155 Wicked people do not obey ◄your statutes/what you have decreed that we should
do►,
so you will certainly not save them.
156 Yahweh, you are very merciful;
allow me to continue to live because of my obeying ◄your regulations/the rules
that you have given to us►.
157 Many people are my enemies and many people ◄cause me to suffer/persecute me►,
but I ◄do not turn aside from/ have not stopped obeying► [LIT] ◄your
requirements/what you have instructed us to do►.
158 When I look at those who are not faithful to you, I am disgusted
because they do not obey ◄your requirements/what you have instructed us to

159 Yahweh, notice that I love ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared

PSALMS 119:160
906
PSALMS 120:2
because you faithfully love me, allow me to continue to live.
160 All that you have said is truth,
and all ◄your regulations/ the rules that you have given to us► will endure
forever.
161 Rulers persecute me for no reason,
but in my inner being I revere ◄your words/what you have said►.
162 I am happy about ◄your words/what you have promised to do for me►,
as happy as someone who has found a great treasure.
163 I thoroughly hate [DOU] all lies

164 Seven/Many times each day I thank you for ◄your regulations/the rules that you

there is nothing adverse/bad that will happen to them.

I love it all very much.
168 I obey ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared that we should do►,

169 Yahweh, listen while I pray for you to help me;
help me to understand ◄your words/what you have told us to do►.
170 Hear me while I pray

171 I [MTY] will always praise you

120
A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship
1 When I had troubles, I called out to Yahweh
and he answered me.
2 I prayed,
“Yahweh, rescue/save me from people [SYN, MTY] who lie to me and try to deceive
me!”
PSALMS 120:3
907
PSALMS 122:6
3 You people who lie to me, I will tell you [RHQ] what God will do to you
and what he will do to punish you.
4 He will shoot sharp arrows at you like soldiers do,
and he will burn you with red-hot coals from the wood of a broom tree.
5 It is terrible for me, living among cruel/savage [DOU] people
like those who live in Meshech region and Kedar region.
6 I have lived for a long time among people who hate to live with others peacefully.
they talk about starting a war.
121
A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship
1 When we travel toward Jerusalem,
I look up toward the hills and I ask myself, “Who will help me?”
2 And my answer is that Yahweh is the one who helps me;
he is the one who made heaven and the earth.
3 He will not allow us to fall/stumble;
God, who protects us, will not fall asleep.
4 The one who protects us Israeli people
never gets sleepy, nor does he sleep [LIT].
5 Yahweh watches over us;
he is like the shade [MET] that protects us from the sun.
6 He will not allow the sun to harm us during the day,
and he will not allow the moon to harm us during the night.
7 Yahweh will protect us from being harmed in any manner;
he will keep us safe.
8 He will protect us from the time that we leave our houses in the morning until we
return in the evening;
he will protect us now, and he will protect us forever.
122
A psalm written by David for people going up to the temple to worship
1 I was glad/happy when people said to me,
“We should go to the temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem!”
2 And now we are here,
standing inside the gates/city of [APO] Jerusalem.
3 Jerusalem is a city that has been rebuilt,
with the result that people can gather together in it.
4 We people of the tribes of Israel who belong to Yahweh can now go up there
as Yahweh commanded that we should do,
and we can thank him.
5 There the kings of Israel who were descendants of King David sit on their thrones
and decide cases fairly when the people have disputes.
6 Pray that there will be peace in Jerusalem;
I desire that those who love Jerusalem will ◄prosper/live peacefully►.
PSALMS 122:7
908
PSALMS 125:2
7 I desire that there will be peace inside the walls of the city
and that people who are inside the palaces will be safe.
8 For the sake of my relatives and friends, I say,
“My desire is that that inside Jerusalem people will live peacefully.”
9 And because I love the temple of Yahweh our God,
I pray that things will go well for the people who live in Jerusalem.
123
A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship
1 Yahweh, I look up toward you,
up to heaven, from where you rule.
we ask you, Yahweh our God, for what we need,
3 Yahweh, be very merciful [DOU] to us
because our enemies have acted very contemptuously toward us.
4 Rich people have made fun of us for a long time,
and proud people who have ◄oppressed/acted cruelly toward► us have acted
toward us as though we were worthless.
124
A psalm written by David for people going up to the temple to worship
1 You Israeli people, answer this question:
What would have happened to us if Yahweh had not been ◄helping/fighting for► us?
2 When our enemies attacked us,
if Yahweh had not been fighting for us,
3 we would have all been killed [IDM]
because they were very angry with us!
4 They would have been like [MET] a flood that swept/carried us away;
it would have been as though the water would have covered us,
5 and we would all have drowned in the flood that was ◄raging/flowing very
fast►.
6 But praise Yahweh,
because he has not allowed our enemies to destroy us
like wild animals [MET] tear apart the creatures that they capture.
7 We have escaped from our enemies like a bird escapes from the trap that hunters
have set;
it is as though the trap that our enemies set for us was broken
and we have escaped from it!
8 Yahweh is the one who helps us [MTY];
he is the one who made heaven and the earth.
125
A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship
1 Those/We who trust in Yahweh are as secure/steadfast [SIM] as Zion Hill,
which cannot be shaken and can never be moved.
2 Like the hills that surround Jerusalem protect the city,
PSALMS 125:3
909
PSALMS 127:3
Yahweh protects us, his people,
and he will protect us forever.
3 Wicked people [MTY] should not be allowed to rule over the land where righteous
people live.
If they did that, those righteous people might ◄be encouraged to imitate them
and► do things that are wrong.
4 Yahweh, do good things to those who do good things to others
and to those who sincerely obey your commands [IDM].
5 But when you punish the wicked people who are not Israelis,
also punish those Israelis who turn away from walking on the good roads [MET]
that you have shown them!
I wish that things will go well for people in Israel!
126
A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship
1 When Yahweh brought us Israeli people back to Jerusalem (OR, enabled us Israelis
to prosper again),
it seemed as though [SIM] we were dreaming.
and we [SYN] continued shouting joyfully.
Then the other people-groups said about us,
“Yahweh has done great things for them!”
3 And we say, “Yes, Yahweh truly has done great things for us,
and we are very happy.”
4 Yahweh, when it rains, water flows in the streams again after they were dry [SIM].
Similarly, enable our nation to become great again like it was before.
5 We cried when we planted seeds because it was hard work preparing the soil that
had not been plowed for many years;
now we want to shout joyfully because we are gathering a big harvest.
6 Those who cried as they carried the bags of seeds to the fields will shout joyfully
when they bring the crops to their houses at harvest time.
127
A psalm written by Solomon for people going up to the temple to worship
1 If people are building a house without knowing whether it is Yahweh’s will to build
it,
they are building it in vain.
Similarly, if Yahweh does not protect a city,
it is useless for guards/sentries to stay awake to tell people if their enemies come
to attack it.
2 It is also useless to arise very early and go to sleep late at night
in order that you can work hard all day to earn money to buy food,
because Yahweh gives food to those whom he loves.
3 Children are a gift that comes to parents from Yahweh;
PSALMS 127:4
910
PSALMS 129:8
they are a reward/blessing from him.
4 If a man has sons while he is still young,
when they grow up, they will be able to help him defend his family
like [SIM] a soldier can defend himself if he has a bow and arrows in his hand.
5 A man who has many sons is very happy,
like [MET] a soldier who has many arrows in his quiver is very happy.
If a man with his many grown sons is taken by his enemies to the place where they
decide matters, his enemies will never be able to defeat that man,
because his sons will help to defend him.
128
A psalm written for those going up to the temple to worship
1 ◄Happy are/Yahweh is pleased with► those of you who revere him
and do what he wants you to do [IDM].
2 You will be able to earn the money that you [MTY] need to buy food;
you will be happy and you will be prosperous.
3 Your wife will be like a grapevine that bears many grapes [SIM];
she will give birth to many children.
Your children who sit around your table
will be like a strong olive tree that has many shoots growing up around it [SIM].
4 Every man who reveres Yahweh
will be blessed like that.
5 I wish/hope that Yahweh will bless all of you from where he dwells ◄on Zion Hill/in
Jerusalem►
and that you will see the people of Jerusalem prospering every day that you live!
6 I desire that you will live many years,
long enough to see your grandchildren.
I desire/hope that things will go well for the people in Israel!
129
A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship
1 I say that my enemies have ◄afflicted/caused trouble for► me ever since I was
young.
Now I ask you, my fellow Israelis, to repeat those same words:
2 “Our enemies have afflicted us since our nation began,
but they have not defeated us!
3 Our enemies struck us with whips that cut into our backs [MET]
like a farmer uses a plow to cut deep furrows into the ground.”
4 But Yahweh is righteous,
and he has freed me from being a slave [MTY] of wicked people.
5 I wish/hope that all those who hate Jerusalem/Israel will be ashamed because of
being defeated.
6 I hope/wish that they will be of no value, like grass that grows on the roofs of houses
that dries up and does not grow tall;
7 as a result no one cuts it and puts it in bundles and carries it away.
8 People who pass by and see men harvesting grain usually greet them by saying to
them,
PSALMS 130:1
911
PSALMS 132:4
“We wish/hope that Yahweh will bless you!”
But this will not happen to those who hate Israel.
We, acting as Yahweh’s representatives, bless you Israelis.
130
A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship
1 Yahweh, I have a lot of troubles/many difficulties, so I call out to you.
2 Yahweh, hear me,
while I call out to you [SYN] to be merciful to me!
3 Yahweh, if you kept a record of the sins that we have committed,
not one of us [RHQ] would escape from being condemned and punished
4 But you forgive us,
with the result that we greatly revere you.
5 Yahweh has said that he would help/rescue me;
6 I wait for Yahweh to help me
more than watchmen wait for the light to dawn;
yes, I wait more eagerly than they do!
7 You my fellow Israelis, confidently expect that Yahweh will bless us.
He will bless us because he faithfully loves us,
and he is very willing to save/rescue us.
8 And he will save us Israeli people from being punished for all the sins that we have
committed.
131
A psalm written by David for people going up to the temple to worship
1 Yahweh, I am not proud
and I have not thought highly about ◄myself/the things that I have done►.
And I do not concern myself about things that you have done that are very big or very
wonderful.
2 Instead, I am calm and peaceful,
like a small child who lies quietly in its mother’s arms [SIM].
3 You my fellow Israelis, confidently expect that Yahweh will do good things for you,
now and forever!
132
A song to sing along the road up to Jerusalem
1 Yahweh, do not forget King David
and all the hardships/troubles he endured!
2 He made a solemn promise to you,
the mighty God whom our ancestor Jacob worshiped.
3 He said, “I will not go home,
I will not rest on my bed,
4 I will not sleep at all
PSALMS 132:5
912
PSALMS 133:2
5 until I build a place for Yahweh,
a home for the mighty God whom Jacob worshiped.”
6 In Bethlehem we heard news about the sacred chest.
We went and found it in the fields of Jearim city, and we took it to Jerusalem.
7 Later we said, “Let’s go to the temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem;
let’s worship there in front of the throne where he sits.”
8 Yahweh, come to the place where you live eternally,
to the place where your sacred chest is,
to that place that shows that you are very powerful.
9 I want/desire that the righteous behavior of your priests will always be evident,
just like the beautiful robes that they wear [MET],
and that your people will always shout joyfully.
10 You chose David to serve you as king of Israel;
do not reject/abandon him!
11 Yahweh, you made a solemn promise to David,
a promise that you will not break.
12 If they keep my agreement with them
the line of kings descended from you will never end.”
14 he said, “This is the city where I will live forever [DOU];
this is the place where I wanted to stay.
15 I will give to the people of Jerusalem all that they need;
I will give enough food even to satisfy the poor people there.
16 I will cause the priests to behave in a manner worthy of being ones whom I have
saved;
that will be as evident as the beautiful robes that they wear [MET];
and all my people who live there will shout joyfully.
17 There in Jerusalem I will cause one of David’s descendants [MET] to become a great
king;
he also will be my chosen king,
and he will be like a bright lamp [MET] that shines continually.
18 I will defeat his enemies and cause them to be very ashamed/disgraced;
but the crown that my king wears will always shine.”
133
A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship
1 It is very good and very pleasant
for God’s people to gather together harmoniously.
2 It is as delightful as the precious/expensive ◄olive oil/perfume►
that runs down from the Supreme Priest Aaron’s head onto his beard when he is
anointed
and runs down onto the collar of his robes.
PSALMS 133:3
913
PSALMS 135:13
3 Gathering together harmoniously is as delightful
as the dew that falls on Hermon
Mountain
and the dew that falls on the hills near Zion Hill.
Yahweh has promised to bless his people there in Jerusalem
by giving them everlasting (OR, a long-lasting) life.
134
A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship
1 All you people who serve Yahweh,
who stand up and ◄serve/pray to► him at night in his temple,
come and praise him!
2 Lift up your hands/arms to pray to him in the temple
and praise him!
1 Praise Yahweh!
135
praise him!
praise him [MTY]!
3 Praise Yahweh, because he does good things for us;
sing to him [MTY], because he is kind to us.
4 He has chosen us, the descendants of Jacob;
he has chosen us Israelis to belong to him [DOU].
5 I know that Yahweh is great;
he is greater than all the gods.
6 Yahweh does whatever he desires to do,
in heaven and on the earth
and in the seas/oceans, down to the bottom of the seas.
7 He is the one who causes clouds to appear from very distant places on the earth;
he sends lightning with the rain,
and he brings the winds from the places where he stores them.
8 He is the one who killed all the firstborn males in Egypt,
the firstborn of people and of animals.
9 There he performed many kinds of miracles [DOU]
to punish the king and all his officials.
10 He destroyed many nations
and the powerful kings who ruled them:
11 Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group,
and Og, the king of Bashan region,
and all the other kings in Canaan land.
12 Then he gave their land to us Israeli people
to belong to us forever.

they have eyes, but they cannot see anything.
17 They have ears, but they cannot hear anything,
and they are not even able to breathe.
18 The people who make those idols are as powerless as those idols,
and those who trust in those idols can accomplish no more than their idols can!
19 My fellow Israelis, praise Yahweh!
You priests who are descended from Aaron, praise Yahweh!
20 You men who are descended from Levi, you who assist the priests, praise Yahweh!
21 Praise Yahweh in the temple on Zion Hill in Jerusalem,
where he lives!
Praise Yahweh!
136
1 Thank Yahweh, because he does good things for us;
his faithful love for us endures forever.
2 Thank God, the one who is greater than all other gods;

his faithful love for us endures forever.
5 He is the one who by being very wise created the heavens;
his faithful love for us endures forever.
6 He is the one who caused the ground to rise up above the deep waters;
his faithful love for us endures forever.
7 He is the one who created great lights in the sky;
his faithful love for us endures forever.
8 He created the sun to shine in the daytime;
his faithful love for us endures forever.
9 He created the moon and stars to shine during the nighttime;
his faithful love for us endures forever.
10 He is the one who killed the firstborn males in Egypt;
his faithful love for us endures forever.

12 With his ◄strong hand/great power► he led them out;
PSALMS 136:13
915
PSALMS 137:5
his faithful love for us endures forever.
13 He is the one who caused the Red Sea to divide;
his faithful love for us endures forever.
14 He enabled the Israeli people to walk through it on dry land;
his faithful love for us endures forever.
15 But he caused the king of Egypt and his army to drown in it;
his faithful love for us endures forever.
16 He is the one who led his people safely through the desert;
his faithful love for us endures forever.
17 He killed powerful kings;
his faithful love for us endures forever.
18 He killed kings who were famous;
his faithful love for us endures forever.
19 He killed Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group;
his faithful love for us endures forever.
20 He killed Og, the king of Bashan region;
21 He gave their lands to us, his people;
his faithful love for us endures forever.
22 He gave those lands to us people of Israel, who serve him;
his faithful love for us endures forever.
his faithful love for us endures forever.
24 He rescued us from our enemies;
his faithful love for us endures forever.
25 He is the one who gives food to all living creatures;
his faithful love for us endures forever.
26 So thank God, who lives in heaven, for all those things,
because his faithful love for us endures forever!

1 When we had been taken to Babylonia, far from Jerusalem,
we sat down by the rivers there,
and we cried when we thought about the temple on Zion Hill in Jerusalem.
2 On the willow trees alongside the rivers we hung our harps
because we did not want to play them any more because we were very sad.
3 The soldiers who had captured us and taken us to Babylonia told us to sing for them;
they told us to ◄entertain them/make them happy►, saying,
“Sing for us one of the songs that you previously sang in Jerusalem!”
4 But we thought,
“We are sad because we have been punished by Yahweh and brought to this foreign
land,
so we cannot [RHQ] sing songs about Yahweh while we are here!”
5 If I forget about Jerusalem [APO], Iet my right hand wither
with the result that I will be unable to play my harp
PSALMS 137:6
916
6 Do not allow me to sing again [MTY],
if I forget about Jerusalem,
if I do not consider that Jerusalem causes me to be more joyful than anything
else does.
7 Yahweh, punish the people of the Edom people-group
for what they did on the day that the army of Babylon captured Jerusalem.
Do not forget that they said,
“Tear down all the buildings! Destroy them completely! Leave only the
foundations!”
8 And you people of Babylon, you will certainly be destroyed!
Those who punish you in return for what you did to us will be happy;
9 they will take your babies
and completely smash them on the rocks.
A psalm written by David
I sing to praise you in front of the idols of false gods to ridicule/belittle them.
2 I bow down while I look towards your sacred temple,
and I thank you [MTY] because you faithfully love us and faithfully do all that
you have promised.
You have shown that both you [MTY] and what you have promised to do are
greater than anything else.
3 On the day when I called out to you, you answered me;
you enabled me to be strong and brave.
4 Yahweh, some day all the kings of this earth will praise you,
because they will have heard what you have said.
5 They will sing about what you have done;
they will sing and say that you are very great.
6 Yahweh, you are supreme,
but you take care of people who are considered to be unimportant.
And you know what proud people are doing,
even though they are far away from you and think that you do not see them.
7 When I am in the midst of many troubles/difficulties,
With your hand/power [MTY] you rescue me from my enemies who are angry at me.
you faithfully love us forever.
A psalm written by David for the choir director
1 Yahweh, you have examined me,
and you know everything about me.
2 You know when I sit down and when I stand up.
Even though you are far away from me,
PSALMS 139:3
917
PSALMS 139:20
you know what I am thinking.
3 When I travel and when I lie down,
you know everything that I do.
5 You protect me on all sides;
you put your hand on me to protect me with your power [MTY].
6 I am not able to understand that you know everything about me.
That is too great for me to really understand.
7 ◄Where could I go to escape from your Spirit?/I could not go anywhere to escape
from your Spirit.► [RHQ]
◄Where could I go to get away from you?/I could not go anywhere to get away from
you.► [RHQ]
8 If I went up to heaven, you would be there.
If I lay down in the place where the dead people are, you would be there.
9 If I had wings and flew very far east [MTY],
or if I flew west and made a place to live on an island in the ocean,
10 you would be there also, to lead me by your hand,
11 I could request the darkness to hide me,
or I could request the light around me to become darkness,
12 but even if that happened, the darkness would not be darkness for you!
For you, the night is as bright as the daytime is,
because for you, daylight and darkness are ◄not different/the same►.
13 You created all the parts of my body;
you put the parts of my body together when I was still in my mother’s womb.
14 I praise you because you made my body in a very awesome and wonderful way.
Everything that you do is amazing!
I know that very well.
15 When my body was being formed,
while it was being put together where no one else could see it,
you saw it!
16 You saw me before I was born.
You wrote in your book the number of days that you had decided that I would live.
You did that before any of those days had even started!
17 God, what you think about me is very precious (OR, is very hard to understand).
There is a great number of things that you think about.
seashore.
And when I wake up, I am still with you
and I know that there are still more of your thoughts about me to count.
19 God, I desire that you would kill all the wicked people!
And I wish that violent [MTY] men would ◄leave/go away from► me.

21 Yahweh, I certainly [RHQ] hate those who hate you!
And I despise [RHQ] those who rebel against you.
22 I hate them completely,
and I consider that they are my enemies.
23 God, search my inner being;
find out what I am thinking!
24 Find out whether there is anything evil in my inner being,
and lead me along the road that leads to my being with you forever.
A psalm written by David
1 Yahweh, rescue/save me from being attacked by evil men;
and even more, ◄keep me safe/protect me► from being attacked by violent people.
2 They are always planning to do evil things
and they are always inciting/urging people to start quarrels.
3 By what they say [MTY] they injure people like poisonous snakes do;
the words that they speak [MTY] can kill people as easily as cobras/vipers do.
(Think about that!)
4 Yahweh, protect me from the power [MTY] of wicked people.
Keep me safe from violent men who plan to destroy me [SYN].
5 It is as though proud people have set a trap for me;
it is as though they have spread their nets to catch me;
it is as though they have put those things along the road to catch/seize me.
(Think about that!)
6 I say to you, “Yahweh, you are my God;”
so listen to me while I cry out to you to help me.
7 Yahweh, my Lord, you are the one who defends me strongly;
you have protected me during battles [MET] as though you had put a helmet on
my head.
8 Yahweh, do allow wicked people to do the things that they desire,
and do not allow them to do the evil things that they plan to do.
(Think about that!)
9 Do not allow my enemies to ◄become proud/defeat me►;
cause the evil things that they say [MTY] they will do to me to happen to them,
instead.
10 Cause burning coals to fall on their heads!
Cause them to be thrown into deep pits, from which they cannot climb out!
11 Do not allow those who slander others to succeed;
cause evil things to happen to violent men and destroy them!
12 Yahweh, I know that you defend those who are oppressed,
and that you do what is just/fair for those who are needy/poor.
13 Righteous people will surely thank you [MTY],
and they will live ◄in your presence/with you►.
PSALMS 141:1
PSALMS 142:4
141
1 Yahweh, I call out to you;
please help me quickly!
Listen to me when I am calling to you.
2 Accept my prayer as though it were incense being burned as an offering [SIM] to you.
And accept me while I lift up my hands to pray to you
like you accept sacrifices that I offer to you each evening [SIM].
3 Yahweh, do not allow me to say [MTY] things that are wrong;
guard my lips.
4 Prevent me from wanting to do anything that is wrong,
and from joining with wicked men when they want to do evil deeds [DOU].
Do not even allow me to share in eating delightful food with them!
5 It is all right if righteous people strike/hit me or rebuke me
because they are trying to act kindly toward me to teach me to do what is right,
but I do not want wicked people to honor me by anointing my head with olive oil;
I am always praying that you will punish them because of the wicked deeds that
they do.
6 When their rulers are thrown down from the top of rocky cliffs,
people will know that what you, Yahweh, said about them is true.
7 Like a log that is split and cut into small pieces [SIM],
their shattered bones will be scattered on the ground near other graves.
8 But Yahweh God, I continue to ask you to help me.
I ask you to protect me;
do not allow me to ◄die/be killed► now!
9 It is as though people have set traps for me;
protect me from falling into those traps,
It is as though they have spread nets to catch me;
keep me from being caught in those nets.
10 I desire that wicked people will fall into the traps they have set to catch me
while I escape from them.
142
A psalm that David prayed when he was hiding in a cave
1 Yahweh, I cry out to you;
I plead with you to help me.
you know what I should do.
Wherever I walk, it is as though my enemies have hidden traps for me to fall into.
4 I look around,
but there is no one who pays attention to me,
no one who will protect me,
no one who cares about what happens to me.
PSALMS 142:5
920
PSALMS 143:10
5 So Yahweh, I cry out to you to help me;
you are the one who protects me;
and you are all that I need while I am alive.
6 Listen to me while I cry out to you for help,
because I am very distressed.
Rescue/Save me from those who are pursuing me,
because they are very strong,
with the result that I cannot escape from them.
7 Free/Rescue me from my troubles/difficulties [MET]
in order that I may thank you.
If you do that, when I am with godly/righteous people,
I will praise you for having been very good to me.
143
A psalm written by David
1 Yahweh, hear me while I pray to you!
Because you are righteous
and because you faithfully do what you have promised,
listen to what I am pleading that you do for me.
2 I am one who serves you;
do not judge me,
because you know that everyone has done things that are wrong►.
3 My enemies have pursued me;
they have completely defeated me.
It is as though they have put me in a dark prison,
where I have nothing good to ◄hope for/expect►, like those who died long ago [SIM].
4 So I am very discouraged;
I am very dismayed/worried.
5 I remember what has happened previously:
I ◄meditate on/think about► all the things that you have done;
I consider all the great deeds that you [SYN] have performed.
I [SYN] need you, like very dry ground needs rain [SIM].
7 Yahweh, I am very discouraged,
so please answer me right now!
Do not hide from me,
because if you do that, I will soon be [SIM] among those who descend to where
the dead people are.
8 Every morning cause me to remember that you faithfully love me,
because I trust in you.
I ◄pray/send my prayers up [IDM]► to you;
show me what I should do.
9 Yahweh, I have gone/run to you to be protected,
so rescue me from my enemies.
10 You are my God;
PSALMS 143:11
I want your good Spirit to lead me on a path that is not difficult to walk on.
11 Yahweh, restore me when I am close to dying, as you promised to do.
Because you are righteous/good, rescue me from my troubles/difficulties!
12 I am one who serves you;
so because you faithfully love me,
kill my enemies
and get rid of all those who ◄oppress/cause trouble for► me.
144
Written by David
1 I praise Yahweh, who is like an overhanging rock under which I ◄get refuge/am
protected►!
He trains my hands so that I can use them to fight battles;
he trains my fingers so that I can shoot arrows in a war.
2 He is the one who protects me;
he is like a fortress [DOU] in which I am safe,
he protects me like shields protect soldiers [MET],
and he gives me refuge.
He defeats other nations and then puts them under my power.
3 Yahweh, we people are very insignificant/unimportant, so why ◄are you concerned/
do you care about us► [RHQ]?
It is amazing to me that you pay attention to humans.
4 The time that we live is as short as [SIM] a puff of wind;
our time to live disappears like a shadow does.
5 Yahweh, ◄tear open/open up► the sky and come down!
Touch the mountains in order that smoke will pour out from them!
6 Cause lightning to flash with the result that your enemies will run away!
Shoot your arrows at them and cause them to ◄run away/scatter►.
7 It is as though my enemies surround me like a flood;
reach your hand down from heaven
and rescue me from them [SYN].
They are men from other countries
8 who [SYN] always tell lies.
Even in a courtroom where they swear to tell the truth
9 God, I will sing a new song to you,
and I will play my ten-stringed harp while I sing to you.
10 You enable kings to defeat their enemies;
and you rescued me, your servant David, from being killed by my enemies’
swords.
11 So I ask you to save me from being killed by the swords that those evil people carry.
Rescue me from the power [MTY] of those foreigners
who [SYN] always tell lies,
PSALMS 144:12
922
PSALMS 145:12
and who raise their right hands in courtrooms when they solemnly declare that
they will tell the truth.
12 I wish/hope that our young sons will grow up to be like strong plants [SIM],
and I wish/hope that our daughters will grow up to be straight and tall
like the pillars [SIM] that stand in the corners of palaces.
13 I wish/hope that our barns will be full of many different crops.
I wish/hope that the sheep in our fields will give birth to tens of thousands of baby
lambs.
14 I wish/hope that our cows will give birth to many calves
without having any miscarriages or deaths when they are born (OR, that no
enemies will break through our city walls and take us ◄into exile/to their own
countries►).
I wish/hope that there will not be a time when the people in our streets cry out in
distress
because foreign armies are invading.
15 If good things like that happen to a nation,
the people will be very happy.
The people whose God is Yahweh are the ones who will be happy!
145
A psalm written by David to praise God
1 My God and King, I will proclaim that you are very great/glorious;
I will praise you [MTY] now and forever.
2 Every day I will praise you;
Yes, I will praise you [MTY] forever.
3 Yahweh you are great, and ◄you ought to be praised/people should praise you►
very much;
4 Parents should tell their children the things that you have done;
they should tell their children about your mighty deeds.
5 They should tell them that you are very glorious and majestic [DOU],
and I will ◄meditate on/think about► all your wonderful deeds.
6 People will speak about your powerful and awesome deeds,
and I will proclaim that you are very great.
7 People will remember and proclaim that you are very good to us,
and they will sing joyfully that you always act justly/fairly.
8 Yahweh, you are kind and merciful to us;
you do not quickly become angry;
you faithfully love us very much.
9 Yahweh, you are good to everyone,
and you are merciful to everything that you have made.
10 Yahweh, all the creatures that you made will thank you,
and all your people will praise you.
11 They will tell others that you rule gloriously as our king
and that you are very powerful.
12 They will do that in order that everyone will know about your powerful deeds
PSALMS 145:13
923
PSALMS 146:9
and that you rule over us gloriously.
13 You will never stop being king;
you will rule ◄throughout all generations/forever►.
Yahweh, you faithfully do all that you have promised to do,
and all that you do, you do mercifully.
14 Yahweh, you help all those who are discouraged
and you lift up all those who ◄stumble and fall down/are distressed►.
15 All of the creatures that you made expect that you will provide food for them,
and you give them food when they need it.
16 You give food to all living creatures generously [IDM],
and you cause them to ◄be satisfied/have all the food that they need►.
17 Everything that Yahweh does, he does justly/fairly,
and all that he does, he does mercifully.
18 Yahweh ◄comes near to/is ready to help► all those who call out to him,
to those who call to him sincerely.
19 To all those who revere him, he gives them what they need.
He hears them when they cry out to him, and saves/rescues them.
20 Yahweh protects all those who love him,
but he will get rid of all the wicked people.
21 I [SYN] will always praise Yahweh;
He is holy; and I wish/hope that everyone will praise him [MTY] forever.
1 Praise Yahweh!
146
With my whole inner being I will praise Yahweh.
2 I will praise Yahweh as long as I am alive;
I will sing to praise my God for the rest of my life.
3 You people, do not trust in your leaders;
do not trust humans because they cannot save/rescue you from your difficulties/
problems.
4 And when they die, their corpses decay and become soil again.
After they die, they can no longer do the things that they planned to do.
5 But those whose helper is the God whom Jacob worshiped are happy.
The one whom they confidently expect to help them is Yahweh, their God.
6 He is the one who created heaven and the earth
and the oceans and all the creatures that are in them.
He always does what he has promised to do.
7 He decides matters fairly for those who are ◄treated unfairly/oppressed►,
and he provides food for those who are hungry.
He frees those who are in prison.
8 Yahweh enables those who are blind to see again.
He lifts up those who have fallen down.
He loves righteous people.
9 Yahweh takes care of those from other countries who live in our land,
and he helps widows and orphans.
PSALMS 146:10
924
PSALMS 147:17
But he gets rid of wicked people.
1 Praise Yahweh!
147
It is good to sing to praise our God.
2 Jerusalem was destroyed, but Yahweh is enabling us to build Jerusalem again.
He is bringing back the people who were taken to Babylonia.
3 He enables those who were very discouraged to be encouraged again;
it is as though they have wounds and he bandages them.
4 He has determined how many stars there will be,
and he gives names to all of them.
5 Yahweh is great and very powerful,
and no one can measure how much he understands.
6 Yahweh lifts up those who have been oppressed,
and he throws the wicked down to the ground.
7 Thank Yahweh while you are singing to him to praise him;
on the harps, play music to our God.
8 He covers the sky with clouds,
and then he sends rain to the earth
and causes grass to grow on the hills.
9 He gives to animals the food that they need,
and gives food to young crows/birds when they cry out because they are hungry.
10 He is not pleased with strong horses
or with men who can run [MTY] fast.
11 Instead, what pleases him are those who revere him,
those who confidently expect him to continue to faithfully love them.
12 You people of [APO] Jerusalem, praise Yahweh!
Praise your God!
13 He guards your city by keeping its gates strong.
He blesses the people who live there.
14 He protects the borders of your country, so that enemies from other countries cannot
attack you.
He gives you plenty of very good wheat/grain to eat.
15 He commands what he wants to be done on the earth,
and his words quickly come to the place to which he sends them.
16 He sends snow which covers the ground like a white wool blanket [SIM],
and he scatters frost on the ground like wind scatters ashes [SIM].
17 He sends hail down like ◄pebbles/tiny stones►;
PSALMS 147:18
925
PSALMS 148:14
when that happens, ◄it is very difficult to endure because the air becomes very
cold./who can endure because the air becomes very cold?► [RHQ]
18 But he commands the wind to blow, and it blows.
Then the hail melts and the water flows into the streams.
19 He sent his message to the descendants of Jacob;
he tells to his Israeli people the laws and regulations that he had decreed.
20 He has not done that for any other nation;
the other nations do not know his laws.
Praise Yahweh!
praise him from way up in the sky!
2 All you angels who belong to him, praise him!
All you who are in the armies of heaven, praise him!
3 Sun and moon, you also praise him!
You shining stars, you praise him!
4 You highest heavens, praise him!
And you waters that are high above the sky, praise him!
5 I want all of these to praise Yahweh [MTY]
because by commanding them to exist, he created them.
6 He determined the places where they should be in the sky,
and he commanded that they should be there forever.
They cannot disobey that command!
7 And everything on the earth, praise Yahweh!
You huge sea monsters and everything else that is deep in the ocean,
8 and fire and hail, and snow and frost,
and strong winds that obey what he commands,
I tell all of you to praise Yahweh!
9 Hills and mountains,
fruit trees and cedar trees,
10 all the wild animals and all you cattle,
and the ◄reptiles/creatures that scurry across the ground►,
and all the birds, I tell all of them to praise Yahweh!
11 You kings on this earth and all the people that you rule,
you princes and all other rulers,
12 you young men and young women,
you old people and children, everyone, praise Yahweh!
13 I want them all to praise Yahweh [MTY]
because he is greater than anyone else.
His glory is greater than anything on the earth or in heaven.
14 He caused us, his people, to be strong
in order that we, his people,
we Israeli people ◄who are very precious to him/whom he loves very much►,
would praise him.
PSALMS 149:1
926
PSALMS 150:6
So praise Yahweh!
1 Praise Yahweh!
149
Sing a new song to Yahweh,
praise him whenever his faithful people gather together!
2 You Israeli people, be glad because of what God, who created you, has done for you!
You people of Jerusalem, rejoice because of what God your king has done for you!
3 Praise Yahweh by dancing, by beating/playing tambourines,
and by playing harps to praise him!
4 Yahweh is pleased with his people;
he honors humble people by helping them to defeat their enemies.
5 God’s people should rejoice because they have won battles
but they should also hold sharp swords in their hands,
7 ready to use them to defeat the soldiers of nations that do not worship God,
and to punish the people of those nations,
8 and to fasten the arms and legs of their kings and other leaders with iron chains,
9 to judge and punish the people of those nations, like God wrote/declared should be
done.
It is ◄a privilege/an honor► for God’s faithful people to do that!
Praise Yahweh!
1 Praise Yahweh!
150
Praise God in his sacred temple!
And praise him in his fortress in heaven!
2 Praise him for the mighty deeds that he has performed;
praise him for his being extremely great!
3 Praise him by blowing trumpets loudly;
praise him by playing harps and ◄small lyres/other instruments that have many
strings►!
4 Praise him by beating drums and by dancing.
Praise him by playing stringed instruments and by playing flutes!
5 Praise him by clashing cymbals together;
praise him by clashing together very loud cymbals!
6 I want all living creatures to praise Yahweh!
Praise Yahweh!
PROVERBS 1:1
927
PROVERBS 1:15
This book contains many wise things that King Solomon
said. We call this book
Proverbs
The purpose of Proverbs
1 These are the ◄proverbs/wise sayings► that come from Solomon, the King of
Israel, who was the son of King David.
2 ◄These proverbs [PRS] can teach people/By studying these proverbs, people can
and how to obey what these proverbs teach them.
3 These proverbs [PRS] will teach you how to discipline/control yourselves,
and how to do what is right and just [DOU].
4 They will show people who do not yet know much how to do things that are smart.
They will show young people how to become wise and how to make good plans/
decisions.
5 Those who are wise should also pay attention to these proverbs,
in order to become more wise,
and those who understand these teachings will receive good advice/guidance.
6 Then they will be able to understand the meaning of proverbs and parables/
metaphors,
7 If you want to be wise, you must begin by revering Yahweh.
Only foolish people despise wisdom and good advice/discipline.
Warnings about sinful people
8 My son, pay attention to what I, your father, am teaching you.
And do not reject what your mother teaches you.
9 What we teach you will make you respected like having a lovely turban around your
head
and like a beautiful necklace to put around your neck.
10 My son, if sinners tempt/entice you to do what is wrong,
say “No” to them.
11 They may say, “Come with us! Join us!
We will hide and then kill [MTY] someone who passes by.
We will ambush some helpless/innocent people.
12 We will kill them [HYP] and get rid of them completely,
just like people who are buried in graves are gone forever.
While they are in good health, we will send them to the place where dead people are.
13 And we will seize all the things that they own.
We will fill our houses with these things!
14 So, come with us!
Join our group!
We will share with you the things that we steal.”
15 My son, do not accompany them!
PROVERBS 1:16
928
PROVERBS 1:31
Do not walk on the roads with them!
16 They rush to do evil deeds!
They hurry to murder [MTY] people.
17 It is useless to put out a ◄trap/net to catch a bird► because when a bird sees it,
it stays away from it.
18 But those wicked people are not like the birds,
because they do not realize
they will be killed themselves!
others.
They will only destroy themselves!
Wisdom shouts in the streets
20 Wisdom [PRS] shouts to people in the streets,
and calls out to people in the ◄plazas/town squares►.
21 Wisdom calls out in noisy places,
and at the entrances to cities.
22 Wisdom says, “How long will you stupid people continue to enjoy doing foolish
things [RHQ]?
How long will you people who ridicule God enjoy doing that [RHQ]?
How long will you foolish people refuse to know what things are right [RHQ]?
23 If you pay attention to me when I rebuke you,
I will tell you what I am thinking in my inner being;
I will give you some good advice.
24 But when I called to you, you refused to listen.
I beckoned to you to come to me,
but you ignored me.
25 I tried to advise you,
but you refused to listen to me.
I tried to correct you,
but you rejected what I told you.
26 So now, when you are experiencing troubles/disasters,
I will laugh at you.
When things happen that cause you to be afraid,
I will make fun of you.
27 When calamities strike you like a big storm,
when disasters hit you like a violent wind,
when all kinds of things distress you and give you trouble,
I will ridicule you!
28 Wisdom also says, “When foolish people call to me to help them,
I will not answer them.
They will search for me diligently/everywhere,
but they will not find me.
29 They refused to know what things are right,
and they decided not to revere Yahweh.
30 They would not accept my advice,
and they did not pay attention when I tried to correct them.
31 So they will endure what will result [MET, DOU] from the evil way they have lived/
behaved
PROVERBS 1:32
929
PROVERBS 2:18
and the evil things they have planned to do.
32 Those who turn away from me are stupid/foolish;
they will die because of doing that.
33 But those who pay attention to me will live peacefully and safely,
and they will not be afraid that something will harm them.”
2
The results of wisdom
1 My son, listen to what I say,
and consider my instructions to be as valuable as [MET] a treasure.
2 Pay attention to wisdom
and try hard to understand it.
3 Call out to God to get insight;
plead with him to help you to understand more of what he wants you to know.
4 Search eagerly for wisdom, like you would search for silver,
like you would search for a treasure that someone has hidden.
5 If you do that, you will understand how to revere Yahweh,
and you will succeed in knowing God.
6 Yahweh is the one who gives us wisdom.
He is the one who tells us things that we need to know and understand.
7 He gives good advice to those who conduct their lives as they should.
He protects [MET] those who do what is right.
8 He guards those who act justly/fairly toward others,
and he watches over those who are faithful/loyal to him.
9 If you ask God for wisdom, you will understand what is right and just [DOU] to do,
and you will know the right way to conduct your life,
11 If you know [PRS] how to choose what is right to do
and if you understand what God wants you to do,
God will protect you and guard you and keep you safe.
12 If you are wise [PRS], you will not do what evil people do,
and you will not believe what deceitful people say.
13 Deceitful people have stopped acting fairly/justly toward others
and ◄walk on dark and evil paths/do what evil people do► [MET].
14 They enjoy doing what is wrong;
they like to do what is evil and to deceive people.
15 They ◄walk on crooked paths/always deceive others►
and are always dishonest.
16 If you are wise [PRS], you will also be saved from ◄immoral women/prostitutes►;
you will not pay attention when adulterous women try to ◄seduce/entice you by
what they say.►
17 Those women have left the husbands whom they married when they were young;
they have disregarded the solemn promise they made to God not to commit
adultery.
18 If you go into houses of women who are like that,
you will die when you are still young;
the road to their houses leads to hell.
PROVERBS 2:19
930
PROVERBS 3:14
19 No man who ◄visits/sleeps with► a woman like that will again live harmoniously
with his family.
He will never have a happy life again.
20 If you are wise, you should behave like good men behave.
You should ◄stay on the paths that righteous people walk on/do what godly people
do► [MET],
21 because only godly people will live in this land and receive God’s blessings;
only those who have not done wrong will stay here for a long time.
22 Wicked people will be expelled from this land,
and people who are not trustworthy will be thrown {God will throw them} out
of it.
More advice to Solomon’s son
3
1 My son, do not forget what I have taught you.
Keep my commands in your inner being,
you
it will be as though you are wearing a beautiful necklace.
Keep those things in your mind/inner being.
4 If you do, God and people will approve of you
and think highly of you [MTY].
5 Trust in Yahweh completely,
and do not rely on what you yourself understand.
6 Always allow him to lead you.
If you do that, he will ◄show you the right path/direct your life►.
7 Do not be proud of being wise.
Instead, revere Yahweh
8 If you do that, your body will be healthy/strong;
9 Honor Yahweh by what you do with your money;
and by giving him the first part of your harvest.
10 If you do that, you will have a good harvest.
Yahweh will fill your barns with grain,
and your vats/containers will be overflowing with grape juice for making wine.
11 My son, when Yahweh disciplines/corrects you, do not despise it,
and if he rebukes you, do not resent it.
12 I say that because it is the people whom Yahweh loves that he corrects/reproves,
just like parents correct/reprove their sons whom they love.
13 Yahweh is pleased with those who become wise and have good understanding.
14 Being wise and having good understanding is worth more than silver,
PROVERBS 3:15
931
PROVERBS 3:35
better than gold.
15 Being wise is more precious than ◄jewels/precious stones►;
there is nothing that you could desire that would be as valuable as wisdom.
16 On the one hand, wisdom [PRS] enables you to live a long life,
and on the other hand, wisdom enables you to become rich and to be honored.
17 If you are wise, your life will be pleasant,
and things will go well for you.
18 Wisdom is like a tree that gives long life to those who eagerly take hold of it,
and Yahweh is pleased with those who hold onto it tightly.
19 By his wisdom Yahweh created the earth,
and by his understanding he put everything in the skies.
20 By his knowledge he caused the water that was beneath the earth to burst forth,
and he caused rain to fall from the clouds.
21 My son, always keep doing things that are right and things that are smart.
If you do that,
22 you will live many years and be honored and respected {people will honor and
respect you}.
23 If you do what is right and wise, you will be able to walk safely,
and you will not ◄stumble/do things that are wrong► [MET].
24 You will be able to lie down at night and not be afraid of anything,
and you will sleep peacefully.
25 You will not be afraid that something disastrous will happen to you
or that storms that strike the wicked will strike you,
26 because you will be confident that Yahweh will take care of you.
He will not let your foot be caught in a trap/snare.
27 If you are able to help people who deserve it,
do not refuse to help them.
28 If you are able to help someone you interact with,
do not say, “Come back later;
perhaps I can help you tomorrow.”
29 Do not make plans to harm those you interact with regularly,
because they live near you, and they trust you.
30 If someone has not harmed you,
do not accuse him by saying that he has harmed you.
31 Do not envy people who obtain things by violent actions,
and do not imitate/do what they do.
32 I say that because Yahweh considers such people to be abominable/detestable;
but he is a friend to all those who do what is right.
33 Yahweh curses the families [MTY] of those who are wicked,
but he blesses the families of those who are good/righteous.
34 Yahweh makes fun of those who make fun of others,
but he kindly helps those who are humble.
35 Wise people will be honored {people will honor wise people},
but foolish people will be dishonored/disgraced.
PROVERBS 4:1
Advice to young people
If you pay attention, you will understand what is wise.
2 What I am teaching you is good,
so do not turn away from it.
3 When I was a young boy, loved by my mother,
4 my father told me, “Remember my words;
if you obey my commandments,
you will live a long time.
5 Obtain wisdom and understanding,
and ◄do not abandon/hold fast to► [LIT] what I have taught you.
6 Do not turn away from wisdom,
because if you are wise, you will be protected from all evil/danger.
If you love wisdom, wisdom [PRS] will guard you.
7 The most important thing that you can do is to get wisdom.
Even if you obtain many other things,
the best thing is to know what things are wise.
8 If you consider being wise to be very valuable,
people will think very highly of you.
If you cling to wisdom like you would cling to a woman you love,
many people will honor you.
9 If you become wise, that will for you be like a beautiful wreath that is put {someone
puts} on your head;
it will be like a king’s glorious crown.”
That is what my father told me.
10 So now I say, “My son, heed what I say.
If you do that, you will live a good long life.
11 I am teaching you the way to live wisely;
I am showing you how to act justly toward others.
12 If you live wisely,
when you decide to do something, you will succeed [LIT].
13 Hold fast to the things I have taught you to do,
and do not let them go.
Guard them,
because they will be the source of a good life.
14 Do not do the things that wicked people do;
do not behave like they do;
do not even walk on the roads that evil people walk on [MET].
15 Stay away from those roads;
turn aside and walk on other roads;
16 because evil people cannot sleep if they have not done some evil deed on that day.
They cannot rest if they have not harmed someone.
17 What they eat and what they drink are things that they have obtained by acting
wickedly and violently.”
18 The behavior of good/righteous people is like the light that begins to shine at dawn
and then continues to shine brighter until the brightest time of day.
19 But the behavior of wicked people is like deep/thick darkness.
PROVERBS 4:20
933
PROVERBS 5:11
Because it is very dark, they cannot see the things that cause them to stumble.
20 My son, pay attention to what I am saying.
Listen to my words carefully.
21 Keep them close to you;
let them penetrate your inner being,
22 because you will have [PRS] a good life and good health if you search for them
and find them.
23 It is very important that you be careful about what you think,
because what you think controls [MET] the things that you do.
24 Do not say anything that deceives others
and never say what is not true.
25 Keep looking straight ahead toward the events that are before you,
and do not turn aside.
26 Plan carefully where you will go and what you will do,
and then stay on that road.
Then what you do will be right.
27 Do not leave the straight road by turning to the left or to the right.
Do only what is right
Listen well to what I am going to teach you.
2 If you do that, you will be able to choose wisely what to do,
and you will know the right things to say [MTY].
3 What an immoral woman says to you may be as sweet as honey,
and sound smoother than olive oil feels on your skin,
4 but the result of being with her will be bitter like gall
and injure you as badly, like being cut with a sharp two-edged sword.
5 If you go where she goes [MTY], you will go down to where the dead people are.
Her steps will lead you straight to the grave.
6 She is not concerned about the roads that lead to a long life.
She walks down a crooked path,
and she does not realize that she is on the wrong road.
7 So now, my sons, listen to me.
◄Never turn aside from/always remember► [LIT] what I am about to tell you.
8 Run away from immoral women!
Do not go near the doors of their houses!
9 If you enter the home of one of them, you will lose your ◄self-respect/ good
reputation►
and that woman’s husband will not act mercifully toward you;
he will kill you and take everything that you have acquired during your life!
10 Foreigners will take your money,
and all the good things that you have worked for will ◄end up in their hands/
become their possessions►.
11 And when you are about to die,
PROVERBS 5:12
934
PROVERBS 6:6
you will groan with severe pain
because diseases that you have gotten from being immoral will be destroying your
body.
12 Then you will say, “I hated it when people tried to correct me.
I despised people when they reproved/rebuked me.
13 I did not heed what my teachers said!
I paid no attention to those who tried to teach me something about my behavior.
and I will be disgraced in public gatherings.”
enjoy having sex [EUP] only with your own wife.
16 Like you would not waste good water by pouring it into the street,
you should not have sex with other women. [MET, EUP]
17 Enjoy having sex only with your wife;
do not have sex with other women.
18 Let your wife be a source of great pleasure to you.
◄Be happy/Enjoy sex► with the woman whom you married when you were both
young.
19 She is as pretty and graceful as a young female deer.
Allow her breasts to always satisfy you.
Allow her lovemaking to excite you.
20 My son, do not be [RHQ] captivated/charmed by an immoral woman!
Do not fondle the breasts of another man’s wife!
21 I say that because Yahweh sees clearly everything that we do;
he knows where we are going on the roads that we walk on.
22 Evil men’s sinful desires hold them fast;
their sins are like ropes that bind them.
23 Evil men will die because they are unable to say “No” to their desires;
they will ◄go astray/be lost► because of the foolish things that they do.
Warnings against foolish behavior
6
1 My son, if someone has borrowed money from a friend or a stranger,
and if you have promised that you will pay the money back if that person is
unable to pay back the money he borrowed,
2 you may be trapped by what you have agreed to do,
because if the one who borrowed the money is not able to pay it back, you will have
to pay it.
What you have said that you will do will be like a snare to you.
3 So, my son, I will tell you what you should do to escape from your difficulty,
so that the moneylender does not get control over your wealth:
Humbly go to your friend and plead with him to cancel the agreement!
4 Do not wait until tomorrow; go immediately!
Do not rest until you go and talk with him.
5 Save yourself,
like a deer that escapes from a deer hunter
or like a bird that flees from a bird hunter.
6 You lazy individual, learn something from watching the ants.
Become wise from observing what they do.
7 They do not have a king or a governor or any other person who rules them and
gathering and storing food to eat during the winter.
9 But, you lazy loafer, how long will you continue to sleep [RHQ]?
Are you never going to get up from sleeping and go to work?
10 You sleep a for a little time; you say, “I will take just a short nap.”
You lie down and fold/lay your hands across your chest and rest;
11 and suddenly you will become poor.
It will be as though a bandit suddenly comes and takes all that you have.
12 I will describe for you what worthless and evil people are like.
They constantly lie;
13 by winking their eyes and moving their feet and making signs with their fingers,
they signal to their friends what they are intending/planning to do.
14 They plan to do evil things.
They constantly cause strife/trouble.
15 But disasters will hit them suddenly;
they will be crushed/ruined and nothing will be able to heal them.
16 There are six, maybe seven, kinds of people that Yahweh hates. They are:
17 People who show by their eyes that they are very proud;
people who lie [MTY];
people [SYN] who kill others [SYN] who have done nothing wrong;
18 people who plan to do evil deeds;
people [SYN] who run quickly to do wrong things;
19 people who easily tell lies in court;
and people who cause strife between family members.
More warnings about adultery
20 My son, obey my commands,
and do not ignore what your mother has taught you.
21 Remember the things that we have said.
Those things should be like a beautiful necklace around your neck.
22 If you follow our advice, it will be as though what we have taught you [PRS] will
lead you, wherever you go.
And when you wake up in the morning, they will teach/instruct you.
23 These commands and what we teach you will be like a lamp to light your path
[MET].
When we rebuke you and correct/punish you,
we will be showing you the road to having a good life.
24 Heeding [PRS] these commands and things that we have taught you will enable you
to keep away from immoral women
and from listening to the enticing words of an adulterous woman.
25 Even if such a woman is beautiful and has lovely eyes, do not desire to go with her.
Do not let her persuade you to go with her ◄with her eyes/by the way she looks
at you►.
26 Do not forget that you can hire a prostitute for only a loaf of bread,
PROVERBS 6:27
936
PROVERBS 7:9
but if you sleep with another man’s wife, ◄it may cost you/you may lose► your
life.
27 Can you carry hot coals in your pocket and not be burned [RHQ]?
28 Can you walk on burning coals and not scorch/burn your feet?
29 No! And in the same way, anyone who ◄sleeps with/has sex with► another man’s
wife will suffer for doing that.
He will certainly [LIT] be punished severely.
30 We do not despise a thief if he steals some food because he is very hungry.
31 But if he steals something and then is caught by the police,
he will have to pay back ◄seven times as much as/much more than► he stole.
He may need to sell everything that is in his house to get enough money to pay it back.
32 But a man who commits adultery with some woman is very foolish,
because he is destroying his own self/soul by what he is doing.
33 That woman’s husband will wound him badly,
and other people will despise him.
His shame will never end.
34 Because that woman’s husband will ◄be jealous/not want anyone else to sleep with
her►, he will become furious,
and when he gets revenge, he will not act mercifully toward the man who slept
with his wife.
35 And he will not accept any bribe/money, even if it is a big bribe, to ◄appease him/
cause him to stop being angry►.

More warnings about adultery
1 My son, heed my advice,
and guard my instructions as you would [MET] guard a treasure.
2 Obey my commands,
and as a result you will live a good life.
guard them, just like you protect your eyes.
them.
4 Love wisdom like you love your sister.
and let that be as dear to you as members of your family.
5 If you are wise and if you understand what is wise [PRS], you will not sleep with an
immoral woman;
you will not listen to a woman who tries to entice you to sleep with her by what
she says.
6 One day, I was standing at the window inside my house,
and I looked outside.
7 I saw some young men who did not have good sense.
Among them was a man who was very foolish.
8 He crossed the street near the house of an immoral woman.
He was walking along the path toward her house
9 at twilight, when it was getting dark [DOU].
PROVERBS 7:10
937
PROVERBS 8:3
10 Suddenly the woman came out to see/meet him.
She was dressed ◄seductively/like a prostitute►, wanting to persuade him to sleep
with her.
11 She was a loud talker, one who was rebellious;
she [SYN] never stayed at home.
12 She often went into the city streets and plazas/markets,
waiting to trap some man.
13 When she saw that young man, she put her arms around him and kissed him.
Then without being a bit ashamed, she said,
14 “I have some meat that is left over from a sacrifice that I made today to maintain
fellowship with Yahweh;
I have fulfilled/done what I promised him that I would do.
I was searching for you, and now I have found you!

myrrh and aloes and cinnamon.
Let’s enjoy making love.
he has gone away on a long journey.
20 He is carrying a wallet filled with money,
and he will not return until the middle of this month.”
21 So she persuaded him by her enticing/tempting words.
She allured him by her smooth/sweet talk.
22 And he went with her immediately,
like an ox that was going to where it would be slaughtered,
or like a deer (OR, a fool) that is stepping into a noose/trap,
23 where it will remain/stay until someone shoots an arrow into its liver and kills
it.
He was like a bird that flew into a trap.
He did not know that ◄it would cost him his life/he would die as a result►.
24 My son, listen to what I say;
pay careful attention to my words.
25 Do not allow anything to arouse/persuade you to go with an immoral woman like
that.
Do not go where she goes.
26 She has caused many men to be ruined;
truly, no one can count the men she has killed.
27 The road to her house is the road to the grave.
Those who enter her bedroom [PRS] will die as a result.
Wisdom calls to us
8
1 It is as if wisdom, with great understanding of many things, is calling [PRS] out to
people.
2 Wisdom stands on hilltops and at crossroads.
3 Wisdom also stands at the city gates and shouts loudly,
PROVERBS 8:4
938
PROVERBS 8:26
4 “I am calling to everyone!
I am shouting loudly to all people!
judgment;
you foolish people, get good understanding!
6 Listen to me, because I have some excellent/important things to say.
What I say is what is fair/right.
7 I speak what is true;
I detest speaking [MTY] what is false/deceptive.
there is nothing that I say that deceives people.
those who are wise know that what I say is right.
choose my teaching.
If he offers to show you how to be wise or offers you gold,
choose to know how to be wise,
11 because wisdom is more valuable than jewels.
Nothing that you desire is as valuable as being wise.
12 I, wisdom, and understanding of what is smart to do, cannot be separated.
We are like two people who live in the same house.
I know how to be wise and how to make smart decisions.
13 All the people who revere Yahweh hate evil.
I, wisdom, hate people who are proud and people who think they are more
important than others.
I hate people who behave in an evil way and those who say things to deceive
others.
14 I give people good advice and I enable them to do things that are wise.
I understand how things really are, and I am strong.
15 When kings are wise, they rule well;
and when rulers are wise, they make laws that are just/fair.
16 Rulers govern their people with the help of me, wisdom,
and those who have authority decide things fairly/just with my help.
17 I, wisdom, love all those who love me,
and all those who truly seek me will find me.
18 I enable people to become rich and to be honored;
I enable them to have wealth that will last and to be successful.
19 What I can give people is more valuable than fine/pure gold and the best silver.
20 I always do what is righteous and just/fair.
21 I give wealth to those who love me;
I fill their houses with valuable things.
22 Yahweh created me, wisdom, when he began to create the world;
24 I was born before the oceans were created,
when there were no springs from which water flowed.
25 I was born before the hills and mountains were formed;
26 I, wisdom, was born before Yahweh made the earth,
before he made the fields and the soil on the earth.
PROVERBS 8:27
939
PROVERBS 9:9
27 I was there when Yahweh put the sky in place,
when he marked the place in the distance where the sky and the oceans seem to
28 I was there when Yahweh put the clouds above the earth
29 I was there when he fixed a boundary for the seas,
so that the water in the seas would not go past those boundaries,
and when he put down the foundations which support the earth.
30 I was at the side of Yahweh, the master worker (OR, as though I was his child).
I caused him to be happy every day, and I was always rejoicing when I was with him.
31 I was delighted with the world that he created;
I was happy with the people whom he created, too.
32 So, you people who are like my sons, listen to me.
I am pleased with all those who obey my teachings.
33 Listen carefully to what I teach you and become wise.
Do not reject my teaching!
34 I am pleased with those who listen to me,
those who are outside my house every day, waiting for me to come out.
35 Those who find me will have a long life,
and Yahweh will be pleased with them.
36 But those who stray away from me just harm themselves.
All those who hate me, it is as though [IRO] they are loving death.”

Being wise and being foolish
1 It is as though wisdom is a woman who has built a big house for herself,
and has set up seven columns to support the roof,
2 and has slaughtered an animal and cooked the meat,
and has mixed nice spices in the wine,
and has put the food on the table.
3 It is as though then she sent out her servant women to call out from the highest
place in the town,
4 “You people who need to understand more, come in!”
And to those who are ignorant, it is as though she calls out,
5 “Come and eat the food that I have prepared,
and drink the good wine that I have mixed!
6 ◄Leave/Go away from► other foolish people, and if you do that, you will continue to
live.
Walk on the road that will enable you to ◄have knowledge/know what is true
and what is not true►.”
7 If you rebuke someone who will not allow others to correct him, he will insult you.
If you reprove/scold an evil man, he will hurt you.
has done is wrong►, because he will hate you for doing that.
9 If you give instruction to wise people, they will become wiser.
PROVERBS 9:10
940
PROVERBS 10:8
10 If you want to be wise, you must start by revering Yahweh,
and if you know God, the Holy One, you will understand which teachings are
wise/true.
11 If you become wise, you will live many years [DOU].
12 If you are wise, you are the one who will benefit from it;
if you ridicule becoming wise, you are the one who will suffer.
13 Foolish women talk loudly;
they are ignorant and are never ashamed of the wrong things that they do.
14 They sit at the doors of their houses
or they sit on the top of the hills in the town,
15 and they call out to the men who are passing by,
who are trying to be concerned with their own affairs,
16 “You people who need to understand more, come into my house!”
And to those who are ignorant, they call out,
17 “Just as water which you have stolen tastes very good
and food that you eat by yourself tastes the best,
if you have sex secretly with someone to whom you are not married, you will enjoy it
very much.”
18 But men who go to those women’s houses do not know that those who have gone
there are now dead;
they have descended down into the deepest parts of the place where dead people
are.
Wise sayings from Solomon
10
1 These are more proverbs/wise sayings from Solomon:
If children are wise, they cause their parents to be happy;
but if children are foolish, they cause their parents to be very sad.
2 Money that you get by doing dishonest/wicked things will really not benefit you;
but by living righteously you will live for ◄a long time/many years►.
3 Yahweh does not allow righteous people to starve,
but he will prevent wicked people from getting what they want.
4 Lazy people soon become poor;
it is those who work hard who become rich.
5 Those who are wise, harvest the crops when they are ripe;
it is shameful/disgraceful to sleep and not work during harvest time.
6 Righteous people will be blessed by God;
the nice things that wicked people say [MTY] sometimes conceal the fact that they
are planning to act violently.
7 After righteous people die, other people are blessed as they remember what those
people did before they died;
but we will soon forget wicked people [MTY] after they die.
8 Wise people heed good instruction/advice,
PROVERBS 10:9
9 Honest people will be safe,
but others (OR, God) will find out those who are dishonest.
10 Those who signal with their eyes that they are about to do something that is wrong
cause trouble,
but those who rebuke others truthfully cause them to be peaceful.
11 What righteous people say [MTY] is like a fountain that ◄gives life/enables people
to live many years► [MET],
but what wicked people say [MTY] hides the fact that they intend to act violently.
12 When we hate others, it causes quarrels,
but if we love others, we forgive them for the wrong things that they do.
13 Those who have good sense say [MTY] what is wise,
but people who do not have good sense must be punished.
14 Wise people continue to learn all that they can,
but when foolish people speak, they soon cause trouble.
15 The wealth that rich people have protects them like a city is protected by a strong
wall around it [MET],
but people who are poor suffer much because they have no one to help them.
16 If you are righteous, your reward will be a good life,
but all that sinful people gain is to sin more.
17 Those who pay attention when others try to ◄correct them/teach them what they
are doing that is wrong► will live ◄happily/for many years►;
but those who reject being rebuked will not find the road to life (OR, cause others
to go astray).
18 Those who will not admit that they hate others are liars,
and those who slander others are foolish.
19 When people talk a lot, that will lead them to sin a lot by what they say;
if you are wise, you will refuse to say very much.
20 What righteous/good people say [MTY] is as valuable as pure silver [MET];
what wicked people think is worthless.
21 What righteous people say [MTY] benefits many people,
but foolish people die because of the stupid things that they do.
22 Yahweh blesses some people by enabling them to become rich,
and working hard will not make them to become richer (OR, and he will not also
cause them to become sad).
23 Foolish people ◄have fun/enjoy► doing what is wrong,
PROVERBS 10:24
942
PROVERBS 11:6
but wise/sensible people enjoy doing what is wise.
24 Righteous people will get the good things that they want/desire,
but what wicked people are afraid of is what will happen to them.
25 When storms come, the wicked will ◄be blown away/never be safe►,
but righteous people will be safe forever.
26 We do not like a lazy person who refuses to do the job that he is given to do,
just like we do not like vinegar in our mouths or smoke in our eyes.
27 If you revere Yahweh, you will live for a long time;
but wicked people die before they become old.
28 Righteous people confidently expect that good things will happen to them, and that
causes them to be happy/joyful;
but when wicked people confidently expect something good to happen, it does
not happen.
29 Yahweh protects [MET] those who live righteously,
but he destroys those who do what is evil.
30 Righteous people will always be secure [LIT],
but wicked people will be removed from their land (OR, from this earth).
31 Righteous people [MTY] say things that are wise,
but God will shut the mouths of people [MTY] who say what is not true.
1 Yahweh detests people who use scales that do not weigh correctly;
he is delighted with those who use correct weights on the scales.
2 People who are proud will eventually be disgraced;
it is wise to be humble.
3 People who are good are guided by doing what is honest;
those who are not honest will be ruined because of the wrong things that they
do.
4 Your money will not help you on the day that God judges and punishes people;
but if you live righteously, you will live a long time.
5 When people are honest and good, that will ◄direct their paths/show them what is
right for them to do►;
but wicked people will experience disasters because of the evil things that they
do.
6 God rescues/protects righteous people because they ◄are honest/do what is right►,
PROVERBS 11:7
943
PROVERBS 11:21
but those who ◄are treacherous/cannot be trusted► will be trapped because of
their being greedy.
7 When wicked people die, they cannot confidently expect to receive anything that is
good;
they expect that their money will help/save them, but it will not.
8 Yahweh rescues righteous people from their troubles/difficulties;
instead, it is the wicked who will have troubles.
9 Godless people can ruin others by what they say [MTY],
but righteous people will be saved by their ◄own good sense/being wise►.
10 When things go well for righteous people, the people in [MTY] their city are happy,
and they shout joyfully when wicked people die.
11 When righteous people request God to bless a city, that city will become great,
those who ◄have good sense/are wise► do not say anything to criticize others.
13 Those who ◄spread gossip/tell bad things about others► will tell your secrets to
others,
but if there is someone whom you can trust, you can trust him to not tell your
secrets to others.
14 A nation will be destroyed/ruined if it does not have leaders who guide it wisely;
but if there are many good advisors, the nation remains secure.
15 If you promise a stranger that you will pay his debt if he cannot pay it himself, you
will regret it.
You will be safe if you refuse to guarantee that you will pay someone else’s debts.
16 People honor/respect women who are kind/gracious;
ruthless/violent people may get a lot of money, but that is all that they will get.
17 Those who are kind benefit themselves because others will be kind to them,
but those who are cruel will hurt themselves because others will be cruel to them.
18 If wicked people earn a lot of money, that will deceive them because they will not
keep it for very long,
but those who do what is right will surely be rewarded by God forever.
19 Those who always do what is right will live a long/happy life,
but those who insist on doing what is wrong will not live very long.
20 Yahweh hates those who are always thinking about doing evil things,
but he is delighted with those who always do what is right.
21 It is certain that Yahweh will punish evil people
PROVERBS 11:22
944
PROVERBS 12:3
and that righteous people will escape from being punished.
22 It is ◄unsuitable/not proper/disgusting► for a beautiful woman not to know what
is right to do,
but when the wicked get what they want, it causes everyone else to become angry.
24 Some people give their money generously to poor people, but they become richer
in spite of that,
and some people hold tightly to their money, but they still become poor in spite
of that.
25 Those who give generously to others will prosper;
if you help others, they/someone will help you, too.
26 People curse/despise someone who hoards his grain and does not sell it, waiting to
get a higher/bigger price for it,
but they praise someone who sells it when people need it, even when the price is
not high.
27 If you sincerely want to do what is right, people will respect you,
but if you are wanting to cause trouble, trouble is what you will get.
28 Those who trust in their money will disappear like the withered leaves that fall from
the trees,
but righteous people will keep going strong, like green leaves in the summer.
29 Those who bring troubles to their families will inherit nothing [MET] from them,
and those who do foolish things like that will some day become the servants of
wise people.
30 Those who live righteously will live for a long time,
but those who act violently will destroy their own lives (OR, those who are wise
will have many people come and live with them).
31 Sometimes righteous people are rewarded here on the earth,
but it is much more certain that very wicked people [DOU] will be rewarded by
being punished.
12
1 Those who want to know what is right to do want to be ◄disciplined/corrected►
when they do what is wrong;
it is foolish to not want to be ◄corrected/told that what you did is wrong►.
2 Yahweh is pleased with good people,
but he condemns those who plan to harm others.
3 People do not become secure/safe by doing what is wicked;
PROVERBS 12:4
945
PROVERBS 12:18
righteous people will be very safe and secure [LIT] like [MET] a tree that has deep
roots.
4 A good wife is one who causes her husband to be greatly honored,
but a wife who does things that cause her husband to be ashamed will destroy
him like [SIM] cancer destroys his bones.
5 What righteous people want to do is to treat people fairly;
what wicked people want to do is to deceive people.
6 What wicked people say is like a trap [MET] that kills [MTY] people who pass by,
but what righteous people say [MTY] rescues those whom wicked people threaten
to harm.
7 Wicked people will die before they become old and we will see them no more,
but righteous people will live for many years and have many descendants.
8 People will praise those who have good sense,
but people will despise those ◄who are always thinking about doing evil things/
whose thinking is twisted►.
9 It is better to be a humble/ordinary person who has only one servant
than to think that you are very important while you have nothing to eat.
10 Righteous people take care of their domestic animals,
but wicked people act cruelly toward their animals.
11 Farmers who work hard in their fields will produce good crops that will give them
plenty to eat,
but those who waste their time working on worthless projects are foolish.
12 Wicked people desire to take away what other evil people have,
but Yahweh enables righteous/godly people to be steadfast and productive [MET].
13 Evil people are trapped by the evil things that they say [MTY],
but righteous people escape from trouble.
14 People are rewarded for the good things that they say to others,
and people are also rewarded for the good work that they do [MTY].
15 Foolish people always think that what they are doing is right;
wise people heed other people when they give them good advice.
16 Foolish people quickly become angry when someone does something that they don’t
like;
but those who have good sense ignore it when others insult them.
17 In the courtroom, honest people say what is true,
but untruthful/dishonest people tell nothing but lies.
18 What some people say hurts people badly, as much as [SIM] a sword can;
PROVERBS 12:19
946
PROVERBS 13:5
but what wise people say ◄heals others’ souls/comforts others►.
19 When people tell [MTY] lies, others soon realize that what they said is not true
[IDM];
but when people say what is true, others will remember that forever.
20 Those who plan to do what is evil are always wanting to deceive others,
but things will go well for those who plan to do good things.
21 Bad things usually [HYP] do not happen to righteous people,
but wicked people always have troubles.
22 Yahweh detests those [MTY] who tell lies,
do.
23 Those with good sense do not reveal all that they know;
foolish people show clearly by what they say that they ◄are ignorant/have not
learned much►.
24 Those [SYN] who work hard become rulers of others;
those who are lazy become slaves of others.
26 Godly/Righteous people try to give good advice to their friends (OR, try to make
friends with others),
but the manner in which wicked people live misleads their friends.
27 Lazy people do not even cook the meat of the animals that they catch/kill,
but those who work hard will acquire (OR, are like) a valuable treasure.
28 Those who ◄live righteously/continually do what is right► are walking on the road
to a long life;
◄it is not a road to death/they will not die when they are still young►.
13
1 Children who are wise ◄pay attention/heed it► when their parents discipline/correct
them;
but foolish children do not pay attention when someone rebukes them for their
bad behavior.
2 Good people are rewarded [IDM] for the good things [MET] that they say,
but those who desire to deceive others are very eager to act violently.
3 Those who are very careful about what they say [MTY] will live a long life;
those who talk ◄without thinking/too much► will ruin themselves.
4 People who are lazy want things very much, but they will not get anything [HYP].
People who work hard will get all that they want.
5 Righteous/Honest people hate/detest lies,
PROVERBS 13:6
947
PROVERBS 13:19
but what wicked people do ◄is very disgraceful/stinks► [DOU].
6 The behavior [PRS] of those who always do what is right will protect them,
but sinful behavior will ruin wicked people.
7 Some people who have nothing pretend to be rich,
but other people who are very rich pretend to be poor.
8 Rich people are able to pay people who want to kill them, with the result that they
will be protected, not killed,
them.
9 Righteous people are like a lamp [MET] that shines brightly,
but wicked people are like [MET] a lamp that will soon be extinguished.
10 People who are arrogant/proud always cause strife;
those who are wise ask other people for good advice.
11 Those who acquire a lot of money quickly by doing what is wrong, probably will
lose it quickly,
but if people earn money slowly, the amount of money they have will increase.
12 When people do not receive the things that they are expecting to receive, ◄it causes
them to despair/they become very sad►;
but if you receive what you are desiring to get, that will be like a tree [MET] whose
fruit gives you life (OR, that will cause you to be joyful).
13 Those who despise the good advice that others give them are bringing ruin on
themselves;
those who pay attention to that advice will ◄be secure/succeed►.
14 What wise people teach is like a fountain whose water gives life [MET];
what they teach you will help you to escape when something dangerous is
threatening to kill you [MET].
15 People respect those who have good sense,
but those who cannot be trusted are on the road to being ruined/destroyed (OR,
will have a lot of difficulties/troubles).
16 Those who have good sense always think carefully/wisely before they do something;
foolish people show by what they say and do that they are foolish.
17 Messengers who are not reliable cause trouble,
but those who faithfully deliver their messages cause people to act peacefully.
18 Those who refuse to pay attention when others discipline/correct them will become
poor and disgraced;
people respect those who accept it when they are rebuked for their bad behavior.
19 It is delightful to receive what we desire;
PROVERBS 13:20
foolish people hate/refuse to turn away from doing evil.
20 Those who habitually associate with wise people become wise;
those who ◄are close friends of/associate with► foolish people will ◄regret it/be
ruined►.
21 Sinners have trouble [PRS] wherever they go,
but things will go well for righteous people.
22 When good people die, their grandchildren inherit their money;
but when sinners die, the money that they had will end up in the hands of
righteous people.
23 Sometimes poor people’s fields produce plenty of food,
but unjust people take away all that food.
24 Those who do not punish their children for bad behavior do not really love them;
those who love their children start to discipline them when the children are still
young.
25 Righteous people have enough food to eat and be satisfied,
but the stomachs of wicked people [SYN] are always empty.
14
1 Wise women [PRS] hold their families together by the wise things that they do,
but foolish women ruin their families by the foolish things that they do.
2 By continually behaving/acting righteously, people show that they greatly revere
Yahweh;
those who ◄walk on crooked paths/always deceive others► show that they despise
but wise people will be protected by what they say [MTY].
4 If a man has no oxen to plow his field, he does not need to put grain in their feedbox,
but if he has oxen, they will enable him to produce an abundant crop.
5 Witnesses who are reliable always say what ◄is true/really happened►,
because they will not be able to teach you anything useful.
8 Those who have good sense are wise, so they know what they should do and what
they should not do;
foolish people do not know what is right to do, but because they think that they
do, they are deceiving themselves.
PROVERBS 14:9
949
PROVERBS 14:24
9 Foolish people make fun of their committing sins;
but God is pleased with those who do what is right.
10 If you are very sad or if you are joyful, only you know what you are experiencing;
no one else can know what you are feeling.
11 Houses built by wicked people will be destroyed,
but houses built by good/righteous people will last for a long time.
12 There are some kinds of behavior [MET] that some people falsely think are right,
but ◄walking on those roads/continually doing those things► causes those people
to die.
13 Sometimes when people laugh, they are really sad,
and when they stop laughing, they are still sad.
14 Those who stubbornly continue to do what is wrong will get what they deserve,
and those who continually do what is good will also get what they deserve.
15 Foolish people believe everything that people tell them;
those who have good sense think carefully about what will be the result of their
actions.
16 Wise people are careful and avoid doing things that will give them trouble;
foolish people are careless and act ◄too quickly/without thinking►.
17 Those who quickly become angry [IDM] do foolish things;
people hate those who plan to do wicked things (OR, those who have good sense
remain calm/patient).
18 Foolish people get what they deserve for doing foolish things;
those with good sense are rewarded [MET] by being able to learn a lot.
19 Some day evil people will bow down in front of righteous people to show that they
respect them;
they will humbly stand at the gates of the houses of righteous people and request
their help.
20 No one likes poor people; even their friends/neighbors do not like them;
rich people have many friends, but only while the rich people still have money.
21 It is sinful to despise your poor neighbors;
God is pleased with those who do kind things for the poor.
22 Those who plan to do things that are evil/wrong are walking on the wrong road;
people faithfully love, respect and are loyal to those who plan to do what is good.
23 If you work hard, you will ◄accomplish something good/get a good income►,
but if all you do is to talk and not work, you will remain poor.
24 One of the rewards [MET] of being wise is to become rich;
PROVERBS 14:25
950
PROVERBS 15:3
the reward of acting foolishly is to become more foolish.
25 By saying in court what is true, you can save the life of the one who is being falsely
accused;
if you tell lies, you are abandoning someone who needs your help to defend him.
26 Those who revere Yahweh are confident that he will protect them,
and their family will also be protected.
27 Having an awesome respect for Yahweh is like [MET] having a fountain that gives
life;
it will help you to escape when something dangerous is threatening to kill you
[MET].
28 If a king rules over many people, many people will be able to honor him;
if he has only a few people in his kingdom, he will have very little [HYP] power.
29 Those who do not quickly become angry are very wise;
by quickly becoming angry, people show that they are foolish.
30 Having a mind that is peaceful results in having a healthy body;
having a mind that is often in turmoil is like [MET] cancer in a person’s bones.
31 Those who oppress poor people are insulting God, the one who made those poor
people,
but acting kindly toward them is respecting God.
32 Wicked people ruin themselves by the evil things that they do,
but righteous/ good people are kept safe/ protected even when they die (OR,
34 When the people of a nation continually act righteously, it causes that nation to be
great;
continually doing what is evil causes a nation to be disgraced.
35 Kings are pleased with officials who do their work competently/skillfully,
but they punish [MTY] those who do their work in a manner that causes the kings
to be disgraced.
15
1 When people are angry with you, reply to them gently, and it will calm them;
but if you reply harshly to them, it causes them to become more angry.
2 When wise people speak [MTY], it causes those who hear what they say to want to
know more;
foolish people continually say [MTY] what is foolish.
3 Yahweh sees [MTY] what is happening everywhere;
PROVERBS 15:4
951
PROVERBS 15:19
he observes what bad people do as well as what good people do.
4 Those who speak [MTY] kindly to people are like [MET] trees whose fruit gives life;
speaking what is false causes people to ◄despair/feel very discouraged►.
wise children accept it.
6 There are many valuable things in the houses of righteous people;
the wealth of wicked people causes them to have troubles/difficulties.
7 What wise people teach [MTY] causes others to know much more,
but foolish people cannot teach others what is useful.
8 Yahweh detests the sacrifices that are offered by wicked people;
what delights/pleases him very much are the prayers of righteous/good people.
9 Yahweh hates/detests the behavior of wicked people,
but he loves those who always do what is righteous/just/fair.
10 Those who do what is wrong will be severely punished;
those who do not want to be corrected will die.
11 Yahweh knows what is happening in the place where dead people [DOU] are,
so he certainly knows [RHQ] what people are thinking.
12 Some people do not want to be corrected;
they never go to wise people to seek good advice from them.
13 When people are happy, they have smiles on their faces;
but when they are sad, by looking at their faces we can see that they are sad.
14 Those who have good sense want to learn more;
foolish people [MTY] are very satisfied with being foolish/ignorant.
15 Those who are oppressed constantly have difficulties,
but those who (OR, if they) are happy, it is as though [MET] they are having a big
feast every day.
16 Being poor and revering Yahweh
is better than being rich and having a lot of troubles.
17 Eating meals with people whom you love and having only vegetables to eat
is better than eating with people who hate each other and having lots of good
meat to eat.
18 Those who quickly become angry cause arguments/quarreling,
but those who do not quickly become angry cause people to act peacefully.
19 Lazy people constantly have difficulties [MET]; it is as though they are walking
through thorns;
PROVERBS 15:20
952
PROVERBS 16:1
but those who are honest and hard-working will have few difficulties; it is as
though they are walking on a level highway [MET].
20 Children who are wise cause their parents to be happy;
it is foolish children who despise their parents.
21 Foolish people are happy to continually act foolishly;
those who have good sense do what is right.
22 If there is no one to give us good advice, we will not accomplish what we are
planning to do;
but when we have many good advisors, we will succeed.
23 People rejoice when they are able to reply well to what others have asked them;
truly, it is very delightful to be able to say the right thing at the right time.
24 Wise people walk on a road that leads up to a long life;
they do not walk on a road that leads down to the place where dead people are.
26 Yahweh detests what wicked people are thinking about doing;
but when people say what is kind, he considers those words to be pure.
27 Those who try hard to get money by acting dishonestly cause trouble for their
family;
those who refuse to accept bribes will live for a long time.
28 Righteous/Good people think carefully before they answer what others ask them;
wicked people very quickly say what is evil.
29 Yahweh does not listen [MTY] to what wicked people request him to do;
he listens to righteous people when they pray.
30 If people have a smile on their faces, it makes them/others happy,
and when people hear good news, it refreshes their spirits [MTY].
31 If people pay attention when people correct/warn them,
they will become wise.
32 If people refuse to listen when others try to correct them, they are despising/hurting
themselves;
those who ◄pay attention/heed► when others warn them ◄become wiser/acquire
good sense►.
PROVERBS 16:2
953
PROVERBS 16:16
but Yahweh is the one who decides [MTY] what really will happen.
2 People may think that their actions are right,
but Yahweh really knows why people do what they do.
3 ◄Request/Rely on► Yahweh to direct what you plan to do;
if you do that, you will succeed in what you plan.
4 Yahweh knows why he does everything that he does;
he has even prepared the wicked for the time that he will punish them.
5 Yahweh hates/detests everyone who is proud [IDM];
you can be certain [IDM] that they will be punished [LIT].
6 Be loyal to Yahweh and faithfully obey him; if you do that, he will forgive you for
having sinned.
If we revere him, nothing evil will happen to us (OR, he will prevent evil things
from happening to us).
7 When our behavior pleases Yahweh,
he even causes our enemies to act peacefully toward us.
8 It is better to have a small amount of money that is earned honestly
than to have a lot of money that is acquired dishonestly.
9 People plan what they want to do,
but Yahweh directs/determines what they will really be able to do.
10 If God directs what a king says,
what he decides is always right/fair.
11 Yahweh wants us to use scales that are correct;
the weights in his bag are correct, because he made them.
12 Kings detest those who do evil,
because it is people doing what is fair/right that causes their governments to be
[MTY] strong.
13 Kings are delighted to hear people say [MTY] what is true;
they love those who say what is right/honest.
14 If a king becomes angry, he may command that someone be executed,
so wise people will try to cause him to be calm.
15 If a king has a smile [MTY] on his face, he will enable people to have a long life
(OR, he will not order people to be executed);
his being pleased with people is as delightful as rain in the springtime when seeds
are planted.
16 Becoming wise is better than aquiring gold;
getting good understanding/insight is better than acquiring silver.
PROVERBS 16:17
954
PROVERBS 16:32
17 Those whose behavior [MET] is good/right turn away from doing evil;
those who guard their conduct [MTY] protect their lives.
18 Being proud will ◄lead to your having/cause you to have► disasters;
despising others will result in your being ruined.
19 It is better to be humble and poor
than to associate with proud people and to become rich by dividing with them
◄plunder/goods captured in a battle►.
20 Those who heed good teaching/instruction will prosper;
happy are those who trust in Yahweh.
21 People say that those who are wise learn what is right/good behavior,
and those who talk pleasantly are able to influence others to do what is right.
22 Being wise is like having a fountain that gives life [MET],
but foolish people are punished as a result of their acting foolishly.
23 Those who are wise think carefully before they talk,
24 Kind words are like honey [SIM]:
We enjoy them both, and both cause our bodies to be healthy/strong.
25 There are some kinds of behavior [MET] that people think are right,
but ◄walking on those roads [MET]/continually doing those things► causes those
people to die.
26 If a worker ◄has an appetite/is hungry►, that urges him to work hard
because he [SYN] wants to earn money to buy things to eat.
27 Worthless people plan ways to cause trouble for others,
and even what they say injures people like a hot fire does [SIM].
28 Deceitful people cause strife/quarreling among other people;
those who say false things about other people cause people who are friends to
become enemies.
29 Those who act violently entice/encourage others to also act violently
and lead them along a road that will end in disaster.
30 People sometimes show with one of their eyes to signal to their friends that they are
planning to do something to harm others;
they smirk when they are about to do something evil.
31 Gray hair is like a glorious crown [MET]
that is given to people who have always behaved righteously.
32 Those who do not become angry quickly are better than those who are powerful;
PROVERBS 16:33
955
PROVERBS 17:13
it is better to ◄control your temper/keep yourself from becoming very angry►
than to conquer a city.
33 People ◄cast lots/throw marked stones► to decide what should be done,
but God is the one who truly decides what will happen.
17
1 It is better to eat a dry piece of bread and not have strife/quarrels
2 A slave who acts wisely will some day be the boss of his master’s disgraceful son
and when his master dies, the slave will receive part of his master’s possessions.
3 Workers put silver and gold in a very hot furnace to burn out what is impure,
and Yahweh similarly examines people’s inner beings to see if they are pure.
4 Those who do what is evil pay attention to people who say [MTY] what is evil,
and liars pay attention to other people’s lies.
5 Those who make fun of poor people insult God, the one who made the poor people,
and those who are happy when someone else has troubles will certainly be
punished [LIT] by God.
6 Old people are usually proud of [MET] their grandchildren,
just like children are usually proud of their parents.
7 Fine/Eloquent speech is not suitable for foolish people to say,
just like lies are not suitable for rulers to say.
8 People think that a bribe is like a magic stone to persuade someone to do what they
want him to do;
to do.
9 If you want people to like/love you, forgive them for the wrong things that they do
to you.
If you continue to remind them about those wrong things, they will no longer be
your friends.
10 Rebuking people who have good sense will accomplish more for them
than hitting them 100 times with a stick.
11 Because wicked people are always trying to cause trouble,
someone will be sent to severely punish them.
12 A mother bear whose cubs have been taken away from her is dangerous,
but it is more dangerous to confront a foolish person who is doing something
foolish.
13 If someone does something evil in return for something good being done to him,
evil/trouble will never leave that person’s family.
PROVERBS 17:14
956
PROVERBS 17:28
14 Starting a quarrel is like allowing water to start to leak out of a dam;
they both need to be stopped before they get worse.
15 There are two things that Yahweh hates:
◄Condemning innocent people/Saying that people who have done nothing wrong
must be punished►,
and declaring that people who have done wicked things should not be punished.
16 It is useless to allow foolish people [RHQ] to try to become wise by paying for it,
because they do not have enough good sense to become wise.
17 Friends love others all the time,
and relatives are able to help us when we have troubles.
18 If someone borrows money from another person, it is foolish for you to promise
[IDM] that you will pay the money back
if that other person is unable to pay back the money that he borrowed.
19 Those who like to sin also like to cause strife/trouble;
and those who build fancy doors in their houses to show that they are very wealthy
will not prosper,
and disasters will happen to those who always tell lies.
21 Children who are foolish soon cause their parents to be very sad;
their parents will not be joyful at all.
22 Being cheerful is like swallowing good medicine;
being discouraged/gloomy all the time will ◄drain away your energy/cause you
to become weak► [MTY].
23 Wicked people/judges accept bribes that are given to them secretly,
and as a result they do not decide matters justly/fairly.
24 Those who have good sense determine to do what is wise,
but foolish people are always thinking about many different things and never
decide what they should do.
25 Children who are foolish cause their father to be sad
and also cause their mother to be very sorrowful.
26 It is not right to force someone who has done nothing wrong to pay a fine;
it is wrong to punish good/respected people.
and those who ◄control their tempers/ keep themselves from becoming very
PROVERBS 18:1
957
PROVERBS 18:14
if foolish people ◄do not say anything/keep their mouths shut►, others will think
that they are very intelligent.
18
1 Those who separate themselves from other people think only about those things that
they are interested in;
they would constantly disagree/quarrel with them.
2 Foolish people do not want to understand anything;
they only want to ◄express their own opinions/say what they think► [IDM].
3 Whenever people do wicked things, others will despise them;
when people do things that cause themselves to no longer be honored, they will
be disgraced also.
4 What wise people say is like a deep ocean that you can never get to the bottom of
[MET],
and it refreshes us like water from a rapidly flowing stream.
5 It is not good for a judge to decide matters in favor of those who ◄are guilty/have
done wicked things►
and to not do what is just for those who ◄are innocent/have not done what is
wrong►.
6 When foolish people [SYN] start arguments,
it is as though they [SYN] are requesting/inviting someone to flog/whip them.
7 What foolish people [MTY] say causes them to be ruined;
their own words are like a trap [MET] that catches/seizes them.
8 People enjoy listening to what gossips say like [SIM] they enjoy tasty food;
they accept what gossips tell them like [MET] they swallow tasty food.
9 People who are lazy while they work
are just as bad as [IDM] those who destroy things.
10 Yahweh [MTY] is like a strong tower [MET];
righteous people can go to him and be safe like they can run to a tower to be safe.
11 Rich people are protected because they have a lot of money [PRS]
like a city is protected because it has a high wall surrounding it [SIM].
12 Proud people are on the road to being ruined,
but being humble leads to being honored.
13 Those who reply to someone before that person has finished speaking are foolish;
doing that is disgraceful.
14 A desire to continue to live can sustain someone when he is sick;
PROVERBS 18:15
958
PROVERBS 19:4
if he loses that desire, he ◄cannot endure it/will become very discouraged► when
he is sick [RHQ].
15 Intelligent people are always wanting to learn more;
wise people [SYN] are not content with what they already know.
16 If you take a gift to an important person, that will open the way to allow you to
talk to him.
17 The first person to present his case in court seems right,
but when ◄someone else/his opponent► begins to ask him questions, it may
become clear that what he said was not true.
18 If two influential/important people are arguing,
someone can settle the matter by ◄casting lots/throwing marked stones to decide
who is right►.
19 If you help relatives, they will protect you like [SIM] a strong wall protects a city,
but if you quarrel with them, that will separate you from them like bars on a city
gate separate the city from those who want to enter it [MET].
20 People are happy when they hear others say [MTY] something that is good,
they say can cause much harm►.
22 If you marry a good woman, that is like finding a wonderful thing;
it shows that Yahweh is pleased with you.
23 It is necessary for poor people to speak politely when they request rich people to do
something for them,
but rich people reply very impolitely when poor people speak to them.
24 There are some people who only pretend to be friends with us,
but there are some friends who are more loyal than members of our families.
19
1 Conducting our lives as we should even though we are poor
is better than being foolish and telling lies.
2 Being enthusiastic but not thinking carefully about what we are about to do is not
good;
doing things hastily can cause us a lot of trouble [IDM].
3 Some people are ruined as a result of their own foolish actions,
and when that happens, they [SYN] angrily say that it is Yahweh’s fault.
4 Those who are rich easily find people who want to be their friends,
but when people become poor, their friends often desert them.
PROVERBS 19:5
959
PROVERBS 19:19
5 Those who tell lies in court will surely be punished [LIT];
they will not escape it.
6 Many people try to persuade important people to do favors for them;
everyone wants to be a friend of those who give gifts.
7 Even the relatives of someone who becomes poor hate him,
and his friends certainly stay away from him, too;
8 Those who become wise [IDM] are doing a favor for themselves;
those who get good sense will prosper.
9 Those who tell lies in court will certainly be punished [LIT];
they will be ruined.
10 It is not appropriate for foolish people to live ◄luxuriously/like rich people►,
and it is even less appropriate for slaves to rule important officials.
11 Those who have good sense do not quickly become angry;
people respect those who ignore offensive things that people say to them.
12 When a king is angry, that causes people to be afraid of him, like the roar of a lion
causes people to be afraid [SIM],
but if he acts kindly toward people, they like it just like they like dew on the grass
in the morning.
13 Foolish children can cause disasters to happen to their parents.
A wife who constantly ◄nags/quarrels with► her husband is as annoying as water
that continually drips [MET].
14 We can inherit a house or money from our parents when they die,
but only Yahweh can give someone a sensible wife.
15 Those who are lazy sleep soundly,
but if they are lazy, they will be hungry because of not earning money to buy food.
16 Those who obey God’s commandments will remain alive for a long time;
those who despise/disobey them (OR, those who do not control their own conduct)
will die while they are still young.
17 When we give things to poor people, it is as though we are lending to Yahweh,
and he will ◄pay us back/reward us for what we did►.
18 Discipline your children while they are young, while you still hope that they will
learn to behave as they should;
if you do not discipline them, you are helping them to destroy themselves.
19 Those who ◄do not control their temper/quickly become very angry► will have to
PROVERBS 20:5
but if we rescue them from those troubles once, we will have to continue rescuing
them.
20 Pay attention when people give you good advice and learn from them,
in order that you will become wise for the rest of your life.
21 People plan to do many kinds of things,
but what will happen is what Yahweh has decided will happen.
22 People want others to be loyal to them;
it is better to be poor than to tell a lie to a judge in court in order to get money.
23 Those who have an awesome respect for Yahweh will live a long life;
they rest peacefully and are not harmed during the night.
24 Some people are extremely lazy;
they put their hand in a dish to take some food but do not even lift the food up
to their mouths.
25 If you punish someone who makes fun of those who are wise, those who ◄are
naive/need to be instructed► will learn to do what is smart;
if you rebuke those who are wise, they will listen to what you say and become
wiser.
26 Anyone who mistreats/abuses his father or forces his mother to leave the home
27 My son, if you stop learning things,
you will soon forget what you already know.
28 Worthless witnesses in court make fun of judges who try to make fair decisions,
and wicked people enjoy doing evil like they enjoy eating good food [MET].
29 God is ready to punish those who make fun of him/religion;
those who do foolish things deserve to be flogged/whipped.

1 Drinking a lot of wine or other strong drinks causes people to start fighting;
it is foolish to become drunk/intoxicated.
2 Being afraid of a king when he is angry is like [SIM] being afraid of a lion when it
growls/roars;
3 People respect those who stay away from disputes/arguments;
foolish people love to quarrel.
4 If a lazy man does not plow his fields at the right/proper time,
he will look for crops at harvest time, but there will be nothing there.
5 Just as it is difficult to bring up water from a deep well, it is difficult to know what
people are thinking,
PROVERBS 20:6
961
PROVERBS 20:19
but someone who has good sense/insight will be able to find out what people are
thinking.
6 Many people proclaim that they can be trusted to do what they say that they will do,
but it is very difficult to find [RHQ] someone who can really be trusted.
7 If parents conduct their lives as they should,
God blesses their children (OR, their children are very happy/fortunate).
8 A king who sits on his throne to judge people
can easily [MTY] find out what things that people have done are good and what
things are evil.
9 There is no one [RHQ] who can truthfully say, “I do not know of any wrong things
that I have done;
I have ◄gotten rid of all my sinful behavior/quit doing what is sinful►.”
10 Yahweh detests people who use weights that are not right
and measures that are not correct.
11 Even children show by what they do whether they are good or not;
they show whether ◄what they do/their behavior► is honest and right or not.
12 Two of the things that Yahweh has created for us
are ears to hear things and eyes to see things.
13 If you want to sleep all the time, you will become poor;
but after they buy it, they go and boast about having bought it for a cheap price.
15 Gold and precious stones are valuable,
but wise words [MTY] are more valuable.
16 If you foolishly promise to a stranger that you will pay what he owes if he is unable
to pay it [DOU],
you deserve to have someone take your coat from you.
17 People may think that food that they acquire by doing what is dishonest will taste
very good,
but later they will not enjoy what they have done any more than they would enjoy
eating gravel/sand.
18 When people give you good advice, if you do what they suggest, your plans will
succeed;
so be sure to get good advice from wise people before you start fighting a war.
19 Those who go around telling gossip are always telling secrets to others;
so stay away from people who foolishly talk too much.
PROVERBS 20:20

20 If someone curses his father or his mother,
his life will be ended, just like a lamp is extinguished.
21 If you very quickly take the property that your parents promise will be yours after
they die,
you will not receive any good/blessing from it.
22 Do not say, “I will do evil to those who do evil to me;”
wait for Yahweh to do something about it, and he will ◄help you/do what is right►.
23 Yahweh detests those who use dishonest scales
and weights that are not accurate/correct.
24 Yahweh is the one who has decided what will happen to us,
so ◄how can we <understand/ know> what will happen before it happens?/
we humans certainly cannot <understand/know> what will happen before it
God,
because later you might be sorry you have promised to do it.
26 Wise kings find out [MET] which people have done what is wrong,
and they punish them very severely [IDM].
27 Our consciences are like lamps that Yahweh has given to us to enable us to know
what we are thinking [MET];
they reveal what is hidden deep in our ◄minds/inner beings►.
28 Kings will continue to rule as long as they faithfully love their people and are loyal
to them
and as long as they rule righteously/fairly.
29 We honor/admire young people because they are strong,
but we respect [MTY] old people more because they are wise.
30 When we are beaten or whipped, it can cause us to quit doing what is evil in our
lives;
when someone wounds us by punishing us, it can cause our behavior to become
good.
21
1 Yahweh controls what kings do [MTY] like he controls how streams flow;
he causes kings to do just what he wants them to do.
2 People always think that what they do is right,
but Yahweh judges our ◄motives/reasons for doing things► [MTY].
3 Doing what is right and fair is more acceptable to Yahweh
than bringing sacrifices to him.
PROVERBS 21:4

PROVERBS 21:18
4 Being proud and arrogant [DOU] is like a lamp [MTY] that guides wicked people;
being proud and arrogant characterizes ◄wicked people’s whole behavior/
those who act too quickly to become rich will become poor.
6 Money that people acquire by cheating others by lying [MTY] to them will soon
disappear like a mist,
and doing that will soon lead to their death.
7 Wicked people refuse to do what is right/just,
but they will be ruined because of the violent things [PRS] that they do.
8 Guilty people continually do what is evil; it is as though [MET] they are walking on a
but righteous/innocent people always do what is right.
9 It is better to live in the corner of an attic/housetop by yourself
than to live inside the house with a wife who is always nagging.
10 Wicked people [SYN] are always wanting to do what is evil;
they never act mercifully toward anyone.
11 When those who ridicule others are punished, even those who do not have good
sense see that, and they become wise,
and when those who are wise are taught, they become wiser.
12 God, the one who is completely righteous, knows what happens inside the houses of
wicked people,
and he will cause those people to be completely ruined/destroyed.
13 There are people who refuse to listen when poor people cry out for help;
but some day they themselves will cry out for help, and no one will hear them.
14 When someone is angry with you,
if you secretly give him a gift, he will stop being angry.
15 Good/Righteous people are happy when they see others do what is just/fair,
but those who do what is evil are terrified when they think about what may happen
to them.
16 Those who stop behaving like those who have good sense behave
cause them to feel happy► will become poor;
those who love to spend money to buy wine and nice/fancy food [MTY] will never
become rich.
18 Wicked people bring on themselves the sufferings
PROVERBS 21:19
964
PROVERBS 22:1
that they were trying to cause righteous people to experience [DOU].
19 It is better to live alone in a desert
than to live with a wife who is always nagging and complaining.
20 Wise people have many valuable things in their houses,
but foolish people quickly spend/waste all their money.
21 Those who always try to act in a fair and kind way toward others
will live a long time and be honored/respected.
22 A wise army commander helps his troops climb over a wall to attack a city that is
defended by a strong army,
with the result that they are able to ◄get over/destroy► the high walls that their
enemies trusted would protect them.
23 Those who are very careful about what they say [MTY]
are able to avoid trouble.
24 Those who make fun of everything that is good are proud and conceited [DOU];
they always act in an inconsiderate way toward others.
25 Lazy people, who refuse to work, will die of hunger
because they [SYN] do not earn money to buy food.
26 All during the day wicked people desire to obtain things,
but righteous people have plenty, with the result that they are able to give things
generously to others.
27 Yahweh detests the sacrifices that wicked people offer to him;
for their evil deeds because of the sacrifices that they bring.
28 Those who tell lies in court will be punished;
no one stops/silences witnesses who say what is truthful/reliable.
29 Wicked people pretend that they know everything,
but righteous people think carefully about what will happen because of what they
do.
30 Thinking that we are wise, and that we understand many things, and that we have
good insight,
does not help us if Yahweh is ◄acting against/not pleased with► us.
31 We can get horses ready to fight in a battle,
but Yahweh is the one who enables us to ◄win victories/defeat our enemies►.

2 There is one thing that is true about both rich people and poor people:
Yahweh is the one who created all of them.
3 Those who have good sense realize that there is something dangerous ahead, and
they avoid it;
those who do not have good sense just keep going and later they will suffer
because of doing that.
4 The reward that Yahweh gives to those who are humble and who revere him

all during their life they will act/behave in that manner.
7 Rich people rule over poor people harshly,
and those who borrow money become like slaves [MET] of the people who lend
similarly, if you act unjustly, you will have disasters [MET];
and if you try to harm/oppress people because you are angry with them,
you will not be able to harm them.
9 God will bless those who are generous [IDM],
those who give some of their food to poor people.
10 If you get rid of those who make fun of everything that is good,
there will no more arguing or quarreling or insulting other people.
11 If you always act sincerely [IDM] and always speak kindly,
the king will be your friend.
12 Yahweh [SYN] ◄watches over/takes care of► those who have good understanding/
sense,
but he ruins the plans/affairs of those who always try to deceive others.
13 Lazy people remain in their houses;
they say, “A lion might attack me if I go out into the street to go to work!”
14 What ◄wives who commit adultery/immoral women► say to men [MTY] is like a
deep pit [MET] into which those men fall;
those with whom Yahweh is angry will fall into that pit.

but if you punish/spank them [PRS], they will ◄stop doing foolish things/learn to

Thirty wise sayings
17 Now listen [MTY] to what wise people have said;
think carefully about what I am teaching you.
18 It will be good to ◄keep these things in your minds/always remember them►,
because if you do that, you will be able to quote/recite them to others.
19 I want you to trust in Yahweh,
and that is the reason that I am telling them to you, now.
20 I have written [RHQ] 30 ◄sayings/things that wise people have said►
from which you will receive good advice and you will be able you to know many
good/useful things.
21 From them, you will learn what is right and what is true,
in order that you will be able to bring back a good report to those who sent you
to school (OR, give a good answer to those who ask you questions).
-122 It is easy to rob poor people who are helpless and cannot defend themselves, but
never do that;
and do not oppress in court those who are needy/afflicted,
23 because Yahweh will speak to defend them,
and he will punish those who steal things from others—by causing them to die.
-2-
24 Do not become friends with those who often become angry,
and do not associate with those who cannot control their temper/anger,
25 because you might start to act like they do
and not be able to stop doing that.
-3-
26 If someone borrows money,
do not be one of those who promises to pay what that person owes
he cannot pay it back,
27 because if you cannot pay it back,
people will surely [RHQ] come and take away everything you own, even your bed.
-4-
28 Do not steal some of your neighbors’ land by removing the boundary lines/markers
that your ancestors placed/set.
-5-
29 Know/Learn [RHQ] this about those who do their work very skillfully:
They will quit working for ordinary people
and will start working for kings
because the kings will want people like that to work for them.

1 When you sit down to eat a meal with a ◄government official/king►,
think carefully about what (OR, who) is in front of you.
2 Even if you ◄have a big appetite/want to eat a lot of food►,
restrain yourself.
3 Do not want to eat a lot of his fine food,
because he may be trying to trick you.
-7-
4 Do not cause yourself to become very tired by working very hard to become rich;
be wise and stop doing that,
5 because as soon as you look [MTY] at all the money that you have acquired, it will
be gone;
it will disappear as if it suddenly grew wings [SIM]
and flew up into the sky like an eagle.
-8-
6 If someone who is stingy invites you to a meal,
do not eat a lot of his fine food,
7 because he will be thinking about how much the food cost that you are eating.
He will say to you, “Eat and drink all that you want!”, but that is not what he will
really be thinking.
8 When you realize what he is really thinking, it will cause you to want to vomit what
you have eaten;
and your kind words telling him that you are enjoying the meal will be wasted.
-9-
9 ◄Do not waste time by/It is useless► talking to foolish people;
they will only despise the wise things that you say.
-10-
10 Do not steal someone’s property by removing a boundary marker that has been
there for a long time,
and do not take for yourself the land that belongs to orphans,
11 because Yahweh is strong, and he is like a relative that has the responsibility to
defend them,
he will stand up in court and argue for them and against you.
-11-
12 Pay attention to what your teachers teach you,
and try to learn from the wise things that they say.
13 Do not refuse to discipline your children;
if you punish/spank them, it will not cause them to die,

and if all that you do is eat and sleep, you will soon ◄be wearing rags/not have
any money to buy clothes►.

22 Pay attention to what your father tells you,
and ◄do not neglect/take care of► [LIT] your mother when she is old.
23 Try to know/learn what is wise, and get good instruction and understanding;

24 Righteous children will cause their parents to be very happy;
those whose children are wise are proud of them.
25 Do what will cause your father to be glad

26 My son, heed what I say to you,

-1829 I will tell you [RHQ] what kind of people are always miserable and sad.
I will tell you [RHQ] which people are always causing arguments/quarrels and
who are always complaining.
I will tell you [RHQ] who are injured in fights
and whose eyes are always red/bloodshot.
30 It is those who drink a lot of wine,
who try drinking other kinds of strong drinks.
31 Do not look with pleasure at red wine that looks nice, and which sparkles when it
is poured out into cups,
and which tastes good as you drink it,
32 because the next morning you will feel like you have been bitten by a poisonous
snake [DOU].
33 You [SYN] will think that you are seeing strange/weird things,
34 You will think you are in a ship that is tossing on the sea;
one side to the other.
