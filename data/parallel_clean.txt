In 1999, the International Conference of Wycliffe Bible Translators adopted a	arỳm abatành ne ar ba.
proposal called Vision 2025. The leaders of Wycliffe Bible Translators wanted to	4 Ar ba:n kam arỳm Amĩnadabi dji.
revitalize our concern for the worldwide task of Bible translation. The proposal stated	Amĩnadabi dji nhym arỳm kato. Katon
our goal: to begin a Bible translation project in every language in which it is needed	kam arỳm abatành ne ar ba. Ar
by the year 2025. That is a very ambitious goal. It seems an impossible goal. Yet we	ba:n kam arỳm Naxõ dji.
believe God would have us strive to reach this goal, for His glory. We believe that	Naxõ dji nhym arỳm kato. Katon kam
too many language groups—approximately 2,600 of them—have waited far too long	arỳm abatành ne ar ba. Ar ba:n
to know of God’s redeeming grace revealed through his word.	kam arỳm Xamão dji.
As an organization, we have realized that to reach this goal we need to be doing	Xamão dji nhym arỳm kato. Katon kam
things differently. We realize that nationals of the countries in which these Bibleless	arỳm abatành ne ar ba.
groups are located will probably do most of the actual translation work. Many of	5 Ar ba:n kam arỳm Rabemã Bôadji dji.
those nationals will be translating into their own languages.	Bôadji dji nhym arỳm kato. Katon kam
As a translation consultant, I concluded that the best thing that I could do to bring	arỳm abatành ne ar ba. Ar ba:n
about the fulfillment of Vision 2025 would be to prepare a new translation of the	kam arỳm Ruximã Ôbet dji.
Scriptures specifically for translators. Existing English translations were not intended	Ôbet dji nhym arỳm kato. Katon kam
to be used as a source text by those who would be translating it into other languages.	arỳm abatành ne ar ba. Ar ba:n
It is our hope that A Translation for Translators will provide information that a	kam arỳm Djexe dji.

Its distinguishing features are:	arỳm abatành ne ar ba.
• Short sentences	6 Ar ba:n kam arỳm Dawi dji.
• Clear connections between clauses and sentences	Dawi dji nhym arỳm kato. Katon kam
• Sometimes clause order is reversed to reflect more clearly the chronological or	arỳm abatành ne ar ba. Ar ba:n
logical order	kam arỳm kubê bẽnjadjwỳr rax.
• All abstract nouns are made into full clauses	Ar ba:n kam arỳm Urij prõmã
• Most passive constructions have an active form and a passive form supplied	Xaromão dji.
• Most rhetorical questions have both a question form and a non-question form	Xaromão dji nhym arỳm kato. Katon
• All figures of speech that we have been able to identify are stated non-figuratively	7 Ar ba:n kam arỳm Robowão dji.
• Simple vocabulary is used wherever possible	Robowão dji nhym arỳm kato. Katon
• Words are always used in their primary sense	arỳm Adja dji.
The implicit information that is deemed necessary to understand what the original	Adja dji nhym arỳm kato. Katon kam

I have based this translation on the scholarship of the Semantic and Structural	abatành ne ar ba. Ar ba:n arỳm

Concerning the theme statements	Kubê ne Kritu.
In this translation, the theme statements precede each paragraph. They summarize	17 Be, Abraão krakam kra mã aben djô'ã
the thematic content of that paragraph, reflecting the most prominent ideas in that	apôx. Nhym me aben nhitepã ar'ã akre:
paragraph. The translator should use the theme statements to make sure that	nhym ar kute 14 pyràk ne aben djô'ã apôx
the reader understands the most important parts of that paragraph. For example,	nhym me kam Dawi'ỳr o bôx. Nhym kam
a translator could rephrase the theme statement as a question to ask during a	Dawi krakam kra mã aben djô'ã apôx.
comprehension check. If the reader/listener has clearly understood the essential focus	Nhym me aben nhitepã ar'ã akre: nhym
of the passage, he should be able to make an equivalent theme statement.	ajte ar kute 14 pyràk ne aben djô'ã apôx.
Example: A Translation for Translators has the following theme statement for Mark	Nhym me kam arỳm me kurê djwỳnh kute
2:1-12: “By healing a paralyzed man Jesus demonstrated his authority to forgive sins as	mebê idjaer pytàr'ỳr o bôx. Me me utàn
well as to heal.” Compare this theme statement with the section heading in the New	krĩraxbê Babirônij'ỳr meo bôx. Nhym kam
Living Translation “Jesus heals a paralyzed man” or in the Jerusalem Bible “Cure of	me krakam kra mã aben djô'ã apôx. Nhym

The theme statements in this translation are not the same as the section headings	Jeju nã kurũm kator kadjy ne ja.
Section headings in most translations often include more than one paragraph. They	18 Jakam dja ba Jeju Kritu kator'ã ajarẽ.
focus on a word, person or event mentioned in the section. These usually do not	Nã kurũm kator'ã ajarẽ. Nãbê ne Marij.
reflect the thematic focus of the section. It is my hope that the theme statements will	Metĩndjwỳnh Karõ ne Marij'ỳr bôx nhym
help translators to write clear and accurate headings in the translation. But some	arỳm tujarô. Marij tujarô kêtri ne Jôdje
may want to write theme statements similar to those in this translation instead of	arỳm amim kum kabẽn nhym me kunĩ

Translators who want to include section headings should carefully consider what to	Kraxje kute o nõr kêt. Nhym kam arỳm

to occur. Although there is a theme statement for every paragraph in this translation,	19 Ne kam bit kute kangamã.
Translation for Translators, the letter to Philemon has nine theme statements. A	mexkam bit kute me kàxã kangamãn amim
translator may choose to have fewer section headings. If a translator includes several	karõo nhỹn amim,
paragraphs in a section, the heading he writes should reflect the themes of those	—Ne ba ren me krãptĩ nhipôkri kanga
paragraphs.	nhym ren me arỳm kam ngryk ne. Ba me
A translator will also need to decide how to present the section heading. In some	krãptĩ kàxã kanga. Nãm ã mexkam amim
Observe that the theme statements do not necessarily use the simplified language	Matêu 1:20

Alternatives which are embedded in another alternative are encased by ‘<’ and ‘>’.	arỳm ngõr. Ngõr nhym aêrbê Bẽnjadjwỳr

10 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Put Aaron’s stick in front of the sacred chest,	Nhym Djexe bãm ne Ôbet.
